				S.No. Provisions of the
				<lb />
				Aadhaar Act
				<lb />
				Reason for being unconstitutional
				<lb />
				1.
				<lb />
				Section 2(c) and 2(d) -
				<lb />
				authentication
				<lb />
				and
				<lb />
				authentication record,
				<lb />
				read with Section 32
				<lb />
				&apos;Authentication Record&apos; includes the time of
				<lb />
				authentication and the identity of the
				<lb />
				requesting entity.
				<lb />
				The UIDAI and the
				<lb />
				Authentication Service Agency (ASA) is
				<lb />
				permitted to store this authentication record
				<lb />
				for 2+5 years (as per Regulations 20 and
				<lb />
				26/27 of the Authentication Regulations).
				<lb />
				By definition it provides for real-time
				<lb />
				surveillance and profiling.
				<lb />
				The record
				<lb />
				stores both the time and the identity of the
				<lb />
				requesting entity.
				<lb />
				2.
				<lb />
				Section 2(h) read with
				<lb />
				Section 10 of CIDR
				<lb />
				The notion of CIDR is by itself an
				<lb />
				unconstitutional database.
				<lb />
				The statute
				<lb />
				cannot operate without a CIDR. The notion
				<lb />
				of a CIDR where every individual&apos;s
				<lb />
				biometric as well as demographic
				<lb />
				information is centrally stored is an
				<lb />
				authoritarian or police state construct and
				<lb />
				has no place in a democracy that
				<lb />
				guarantees individual freedom. A CIDR
				<lb />
				from where data can be backed, and which
				<lb />
				is operated not by the respondents but by
				<lb />
				foreign entities, is conceptually and
				<lb />
				constitutionally
				<lb />
				an
				<lb />
				impermissible
				<lb />
				compromise on national sovereignty and
				<lb />
				security.
				<lb />
				Notably, Section 10 empowers UIDAI to
				<lb />
				appoint one or more entity to establish and
				<lb />
				maintain the CIDR.
				<lb />
				3.
				<lb />
				Section 2(l) read with
				<lb />
				Regulation 23 of the
				<lb />
				Aadhaar
				<lb />
				(Enrolment
				<lb />
				and
				<lb />
				Updates)
				<lb />
				Regulation -&apos;enrolling
				<lb />
				agency&apos;
				<lb />
				The notion of an enrolling agency as
				<lb />
				defined
				<lb />
				in
				<lb />
				Section
				<lb />
				2(l)
				<lb />
				is
				<lb />
				also
				<lb />
				unconstitutional inasmuch as the agency,
				<lb />
				as defined, need not be a Government
				<lb />
				entity but could be a private entity. The
				<lb />
				collection of sensitive personal biometric
				<lb />
				and demographic data and information for
				<lb />
				the purposes of storage must be conducted
				<lb />
				by a Government agency alone since this is
				<lb />
				a bare minimum procedural safeguard
				<lb />
				against the misuse and commercial
				<lb />
				exploitation of private personal information.
				<lb />
				The State, acting as a trustee and fiduciary,
				<lb />
				cannot delegate or require private enrolling
				<lb />
				agencies to discharge this non-delegable
				<lb />
				function. Moreover, an enrolling agency
				<lb />
				that is operated privately cannot be
				<lb />
				entrusted with the crucial tasks of
				<lb />
				explaining the voluntary nature of Aadhaar
				<lb />
				enrolments and securing informed consent.
				<lb />
				4.
				<lb />
				Section 2(v) -&apos;resident&apos; The expression &apos;Resident&apos; defined in
				<lb />
				Section
				<lb />
				2(v)
				<lb />
				is
				<lb />
				arbitrary
				<lb />
				and
				<lb />
				unconstitutional inasmuch as the Act
				<lb />
				creates no credible machinery for
				<lb />
				evaluating a claim that a person has been
				<lb />
				residing in India for a period of 182 days or
				<lb />
				more, in the 12 months immediately
				<lb />
				preceding the date of application for
				<lb />
				enrolment. The forms being used by the
				<lb />
				respondents as also proof of identification
				<lb />
				and proof of address requirement being
				<lb />
				used by the respondents until enactment of
				<lb />
				the statute nowhere require any proof
				<lb />
				relating to residence for 182 days. The
				<lb />
				impugned Act purports to validate all these
				<lb />
				enrolments. The forms being used by the
				<lb />
				respondents do not even contain a
				<lb />
				declaration regarding the enrolee being
				<lb />
				resident for 182 days. Further, there is no
				<lb />
				requirement in the definition of &apos;Resident&apos;
				<lb />
				that the person has to be legally resident
				<lb />
				and the expression would wrongly take in
				<lb />
				illegal immigrants as well.
				<lb />
				5.
				<lb />
				Section 3 -Aadhaar
				<lb />
				Number
				<lb />
				It is an &apos;entitlement&apos;.
				<lb />
				It cannot be
				<lb />
				understood to be mandatory.
				<lb />
				The
				<lb />
				information provided under Section 3(2) is
				<lb />
				of no relevance if obtaining Aadhaar is
				<lb />
				made mandatory. By design, Aadhaar was
				<lb />
				never meant to be mandatory.
				<lb />
				6.
				<lb />
				Section 5 -Special
				<lb />
				treatment to children
				<lb />
				Section 5 of the Aadhaar Act, inasmuch as
				<lb />
				it extends to children and persons with
				<lb />
				disabilities, implies that the State is
				<lb />
				securing biometric and demographic data
				<lb />
				even before the age of consent insofar as
				<lb />
				children are concerned. The Act in its
				<lb />
				coercive reach and application to children
				<lb />
				who have not attained the age of consent is
				<lb />
				per se unconstitutional and violate of the
				<lb />
				fundamental rights of the children.
				<lb />
				7.
				<lb />
				Section 6 -Update of
				<lb />
				information
				<lb />
				Section 6 of the Act is unconstitutional
				<lb />
				inasmuch as it enables the respondents to
				<lb />
				continually compel residents to periodically
				<lb />
				furnish
				<lb />
				demographic
				<lb />
				and
				<lb />
				biometric
				<lb />
				information. This provision is coercive in
				<lb />
				operation and effect and not only
				<lb />
				undermines the so-called &apos;voluntary&apos; nature
				<lb />
				of the programme (as falsely claimed by
				<lb />
				the respondents) but also undermines the
				<lb />
				false claim with respect to the &apos;reliability of
				<lb />
				biometrics&apos;.
				<lb />
				8.
				<lb />
				Section 8
				<lb />
				Section 8 is unconstitutional inasmuch as it
				<lb />
				enables tracking, tagging and profiling of
				<lb />
				individuals through the authentication
				<lb />
				process. It is a charter for surveillance in
				<lb />
				real time and with a degree of specificity
				<lb />
				that enables persons&apos; physical movements
				<lb />
				to be traced in real time.
				<lb />
				The
				<lb />
				authentication mandate in terms of Section
				<lb />
				8 is not being worked by the respondents
				<lb />
				through any proprietary technology and is
				<lb />
				outsourced to foreign entities or entities
				<lb />
				under the ownership and control of foreign
				<lb />
				companies and corporations. The entire
				<lb />
				framework
				<lb />
				and
				<lb />
				working
				<lb />
				of
				<lb />
				the
				<lb />
				authentication procedure in terms of
				<lb />
				Section 8 is an impermissible, permanent
				<lb />
				and irreversible compromise of national
				<lb />
				sovereignty and national security.
				<lb />
				9.
				<lb />
				Section 9
				<lb />
				Section 9 of the Aadhaar Act is also
				<lb />
				unconstitutional inasmuch as the Aadhaar
				<lb />
				number is de facto serving as proof of
				<lb />
				citizenship and domicile. This is seen from
				<lb />
				various media reports where even in the
				<lb />
				absence of any rigorous verification
				<lb />
				process, Aadhaar numbers are being
				<lb />
				issued. The petitioners submit that equally
				<lb />
				subversive of national security and national
				<lb />
				integrity is the practice of passports being
				<lb />
				issued based upon an Aadhaar card. In
				<lb />
				other words, persons who may not be
				<lb />
				entitled to passports are having Aadhaar
				<lb />
				numbers issued and thereafter securing
				<lb />
				passports in violation of the citizenship
				<lb />
				provisions.
				<lb />
				10. Chapter IV -Sections
				<lb />
				11 to 23
				<lb />
				The petitioners submit that the whole of
				<lb />
				Chapter IV of the Act comprising Sections
				<lb />
				11 to 23 is ultra vires and unconstitutional.
				<lb />
				The Constitution does not permit the
				<lb />
				establishment of an authority that in turn
				<lb />
				through an invasive programme can chain
				<lb />
				every Indian citizen/resident to a central
				<lb />
				data bank and maintain lifelong records
				<lb />
				and logs of that individual.
				<lb />
				The
				<lb />
				Constitution of India when read as a whole
				<lb />
				is designed for a nation of free individuals
				<lb />
				who enjoy a full range of rights and who are
				<lb />
				entitled under the Constitution to lead their
				<lb />
				lives without any monitoring or scrutiny or
				<lb />
				continuous oversight by the State or any of
				<lb />
				its organs. The high value of personal
				<lb />
				freedom runs throughout the fabric of the
				<lb />
				Indian Constitution and any authority
				<lb />
				created for the purpose of &apos;cradle to grave&apos;
				<lb />
				scrutiny is directly violative of the personal
				<lb />
				freedom charter built into the Indian
				<lb />
				Constitution.
				<lb />
				The Constitution of India
				<lb />
				does not contemplate a &apos;nanny state&apos; where
				<lb />
				the State oversees every individual&apos;s
				<lb />
				conduct and maintains a record of
				<lb />
				individual interactions.
				<lb />
				The UIDAI by
				<lb />
				design and function is created for an
				<lb />
				absolutely unconstitutional objective of
				<lb />
				invading privacy, electronically overseeing
				<lb />
				individuals and tethering them to a central
				<lb />
				data repository that will maintain lifelong
				<lb />
				records. The notion of individual freedom
				<lb />
				must entail the right to be alone; the right of
				<lb />
				an individual to be free from any monitoring
				<lb />
				so long as that individual does not breach
				<lb />
				or transgress any criminal law. Here, the
				<lb />
				establishment of the second respondent is
				<lb />
				for an unconstitutional purpose of
				<lb />
				overseeing and monitoring individual
				<lb />
				conduct even where the person does not
				<lb />
				remotely fall foul of any law. The second
				<lb />
				respondent is a State organ designed to
				<lb />
				invade individual freedom and whose
				<lb />
				purpose is to constrict individual freedom.
				<lb />
				11. Sections 23 and 54 -
				<lb />
				excessive delegation
				<lb />
				Section 23, read with Section 54 of the
				<lb />
				Aadhaar Act, is unconstitutional on the
				<lb />
				ground of excessive delegation.
				<lb />
				A perusal of the sub-clauses in Section
				<lb />
				23(2) and Section 54(2) indicate that on
				<lb />
				every crucial aspect pertaining to biometric
				<lb />
				data,
				<lb />
				demographic
				<lb />
				information,
				<lb />
				the
				<lb />
				operation and working of the CIDR,
				<lb />
				generating
				<lb />
				and
				<lb />
				assigning
				<lb />
				Aadhaar
				<lb />
				numbers, authentication of Aadhaar
				<lb />
				numbers,
				<lb />
				omitting
				<lb />
				and
				<lb />
				deactivating
				<lb />
				Aadhaar numbers, commercial exploitation
				<lb />
				of information collected by the Government,
				<lb />
				etc. are all left entirely to the UIDAI without
				<lb />
				any sufficient defined legislative policy
				<lb />
				indicating the limits within which the UIDAI
				<lb />
				may legitimately operate.
				<lb />
				Having regard to the invasive nature of the
				<lb />
				Aadhaar programme, its deep and
				<lb />
				pervasive impact on civil liberties and the
				<lb />
				fiduciary/trusteeship principle based on
				<lb />
				which data and information is being
				<lb />
				collected, it was incumbent upon the
				<lb />
				legislature to set out detailed and adequate
				<lb />
				limits to restrict the discretion conferred on
				<lb />
				the UIDAI.
				<lb />
				The impugned provisions
				<lb />
				virtually give an unlimited charter to the
				<lb />
				UIDAI to ride rough shod over fundamental
				<lb />
				rights by framing regulations as it pleases.
				<lb />
				12. Section 23(2)(g) read
				<lb />
				with Chapter VI &amp; VII -
				<lb />
				Regulations 27 to 32 of
				<lb />
				the Aadhaar (Enrolment
				<lb />
				and
				<lb />
				Update)
				<lb />
				Regulations, 2016
				<lb />
				This empowers the UIDAI alone to omit and
				<lb />
				deactivate an Aadhaar number with almost
				<lb />
				no redressal to the individual Aadhaar
				<lb />
				number holder. Regulation 27(2) provides
				<lb />
				that upon cancellation of an Aadhaar
				<lb />
				number, all services provided by the
				<lb />
				authority shall be permanently disabled.
				<lb />
				Regulation 28(2) provides that upon
				<lb />
				deactivation of an Aadhaar number, all
				<lb />
				numbers shall be temporarily suspended till
				<lb />
				such time that the Aadhaar number holder
				<lb />
				updates or rectifies the alleged error.
				<lb />
				Notably, as per Regulation 30, there shall
				<lb />
				be a post facto communication of omission
				<lb />
				or deactivation of the Aadhaar number shall
				<lb />
				be informed to the Aadhaar number holder.
				<lb />
				The only redressal mechanism provided
				<lb />
				under the Aadhaar Act is under Regulation
				<lb />
				32 wherein a grievance redressal call
				<lb />
				centre shall be provided by the UIDAI. This
				<lb />
				provision provides unbridled power to the
				<lb />
				UIDAI to switch of the life of an individual.
				<lb />
				There
				<lb />
				is
				<lb />
				absolutely
				<lb />
				no
				<lb />
				redressal
				<lb />
				mechanism for the individual. He is not
				<lb />
				even provided with an opportunity of
				<lb />
				hearing prior to deactivation, which violates
				<lb />
				principles of natural justice.
				<lb />
				13. Section 29
				<lb />
				This Section is liable to be struck down
				<lb />
				inasmuch as it pertains sharing of identity
				<lb />
				information. The provisions suffer from the
				<lb />
				vice of permitting the spread and
				<lb />
				dissemination
				<lb />
				of
				<lb />
				sensitive
				<lb />
				personal
				<lb />
				information through a network of entities
				<lb />
				and individuals for commercial gain or
				<lb />
				otherwise and allows for the sharing of
				<lb />
				information beyond the ostensible object of
				<lb />
				targeted deliveries.
				<lb />
				Both the biometric as well as the
				<lb />
				demographic information are entitled to the
				<lb />
				highest degree of protection and the
				<lb />
				impugned provision, inasmuch as it draws
				<lb />
				a distinction between core biometric
				<lb />
				information and other information, creates
				<lb />
				an artificial distinction into two classes of
				<lb />
				information which in law are both entitled to
				<lb />
				equal protection against sharing or
				<lb />
				dissemination.
				<lb />
				Sub-section (4) permits UIDAI by regulation
				<lb />
				to permit &apos;core biometric information&apos; to be
				<lb />
				displayed publicly.
				<lb />
				14. Section 33
				<lb />
				Section 33 is unconstitutional inasmuch as
				<lb />
				it provides for the use of the Aadhaar
				<lb />
				database for police investigation pursuant
				<lb />
				to an order of a competent court. Section 3
				<lb />
				violates the protection against self-
				<lb />
				incrimination as enshrined under Article
				<lb />
				20(3) of the Constitution of India.
				<lb />
				Furthermore, Section 33 does not afford an
				<lb />
				opportunity of hearing to the concerned
				<lb />
				individual whose information is sought to be
				<lb />
				released by the UIDAI pursuant to the
				<lb />
				Court&apos;s order. This is contrary to the
				<lb />
				principles of natural justice.
				<lb />
				Section 33(2) provides for disclosure of
				<lb />
				information in the interest of national
				<lb />
				security pursuant to a direction of a
				<lb />
				competent officer. The said provision is
				<lb />
				also hit by the principles of protection
				<lb />
				against self-incrimination, as enshrined
				<lb />
				under Article 20(3) of the Constitution.
				<lb />
				Further, the impugned Act does not define
				<lb />
				&apos;interest of national security&apos; or otherwise
				<lb />
				limit the circumstances where the said
				<lb />
				provision can be invoked. This makes the
				<lb />
				impugned provision unconstitutional as it
				<lb />
				suffers from the vice of vagueness and
				<lb />
				arbitrariness.
				<lb />
				15. Section 47
				<lb />
				Section 47 of the impugned Act is
				<lb />
				unconstitutional inasmuch as it does not
				<lb />
				allow an individual citizen who finds that
				<lb />
				there is a violation of the impugned Act to
				<lb />
				initiate the criminal process. There could
				<lb />
				be several circumstances where UIDAI
				<lb />
				itself or some third party is guilty of having
				<lb />
				committed offences under the Act. By
				<lb />
				restricting the initiation of the criminal
				<lb />
				process, the Aadhaar Act renders the penal
				<lb />
				machinery ineffective and sterile. The said
				<lb />
				section creates a bar on a court to take
				<lb />
				cognizance of any offence under the
				<lb />
				impugned Act, save on a complaint made
				<lb />
				by the UIDAI or an officer authorized by it.
				<lb />
				In effect there is a bar of cognizance of a
				<lb />
				complaint made by an individual for breach
				<lb />
				of his biometric or demographic information
				<lb />
				which has been collected by the
				<lb />
				respondent. Such bar is unconstitutional
				<lb />
				as it forecloses legal remedy to affected
				<lb />
				individuals.
				<lb />
				16. Section 48 -Power of
				<lb />
				Central Government to
				<lb />
				supersede UIDAI
				<lb />
				This Section is vague and arbitrary
				<lb />
				inasmuch as it permits the Central
				<lb />
				Government to take over the UIDAI. The
				<lb />
				Act does not define a &apos;pubic emergency&apos;.
				<lb />
				This Section empowers the Central
				<lb />
				Government in an &apos;emergency&apos; situation to
				<lb />
				be in a position to completely control the
				<lb />
				life of every citizen who is enrolled with the
				<lb />
				UIDAI.
				<lb />
				17. Section 57
				<lb />
				Section 57 is patently unconstitutional
				<lb />
				inasmuch as it allows an unrestricted
				<lb />
				extension of the Aadhaar platform to users
				<lb />
				who may be Government agencies or
				<lb />
				private sector operators. This provision
				<lb />
				clearly shows that the impugned Act has a
				<lb />
				much wider scope than what may
				<lb />
				legitimately be considered as a Money Bill.
				<lb />
				Moreover, this provision enables the
				<lb />
				seeding of the Aadhaar number across
				<lb />
				service providers and other gateways and
				<lb />
				thereby enables the establishment of a
				<lb />
				surveillance state. The impugned provision
				<lb />
				enables the spread of applications and
				<lb />
				Aadhaar dependent delivery systems that
				<lb />
				are provided not from Consolidated Fund of
				<lb />
				India resources but through any other
				<lb />
				means.
				<lb />
				It is submitted that Section 57 also enables
				<lb />
				commercial exploitation of an individual&apos;s
				<lb />
				biometrics and demographic information by
				<lb />
				the respondents as well as private entities.
				<lb />
				It ensures that creation of a surveillance
				<lb />
				society, where every entity assists the State
				<lb />
				to snoop upon an Aadhaar holder.
				<lb />
				18. Section 59
				<lb />
				Section 59 of the impugned Act is
				<lb />
				unconstitutional inasmuch as it seeks to
				<lb />
				validate all action undertaken by the
				<lb />
				Central Government pursuant to the
				<lb />
				Notification dated January 28, 2009. It is
				<lb />
				submitted that there was no consent, let
				<lb />
				alone informed consent obtained from
				<lb />
				individuals at the time of enrolment under
				<lb />
				the said notification.
				<lb />
				Such enrolment which has been conducted
				<lb />
				without obtaining adequate consent is
				<lb />
				unconstitutional as it amounts to wrongful
				<lb />
				deprivation of the most intimate personal
				<lb />
				information of an individual. Indeed, taking
				<lb />
				of an individual&apos;s biometric information
				<lb />
				without informed consent is a physical
				<lb />
				invasion of his or her bodily integrity. The
				<lb />
				collection of demographic information
				<lb />
				through private entities and without proper
				<lb />
				counselling or written informed consent is
				<lb />
				illegal
				<lb />
				and
				<lb />
				incapable
				<lb />
				of
				<lb />
				being
				<lb />
				retrospectively ratified. All these records
				<lb />
				which have been illegally obtained and
				<lb />
				created without necessary consent out to
				<lb />
				be destroyed and cannot be said to be
				<lb />
				validated by the impugned provision. The
				<lb />
				Parliament cannot create a legal fiction of
				<lb />
				&apos;consent&apos; where there was none.
				<lb />
				The executive under the Constitution of
				<lb />
				India cannot take away someone&apos;s
				<lb />
				fundamental right to privacy and then
				<lb />
				support its action on the proposition of law
				<lb />
				that &apos;retrospectively&apos; deems consent must
				<lb />
				have been given.
				<lb />
				The said provision seeks to validate any
				<lb />
				action taken by the Central Government
				<lb />
				alone. The action of private enrolers is not
				<lb />
				even sought to be protected. Therefore, all
				<lb />
				collections made by private entities under
				<lb />
				the said notification should also stand
				<lb />
				invalidated and all data collected by private
				<lb />
				entities should be destroyed forthwith.
