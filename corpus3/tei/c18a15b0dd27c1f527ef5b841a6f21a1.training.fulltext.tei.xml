			THE RECUSAL ORDER
			<lb />
			1.
			<lb />
			In this Court one gets used to writing common orders, for orders
			<lb />
			are written either on behalf of the Bench, or on behalf of the Court.
			<lb />
			Mostly, dissents are written in the first person. Even though, this is not
			<lb />
			an order in the nature of a dissent, yet it needs to be written in the first
			<lb />
			person. While endorsing the opinion expressed by J. Chelameswar, J.,
			<lb />
			adjudicating upon the prayer for my recusal, from hearing the matters in
			<lb />
			hand, reasons for my continuation on the Bench, also need to be
			<lb />
			expressed by me. Not for advocating any principle of law, but for laying
			<lb />
			down certain principles of conduct.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			2.
			<lb />
			This order is in the nature of a prelude -a precursor, to the
			<lb />
			determination of the main controversy. It has been necessitated, for
			<lb />
			deciding an objection, about the present composition of the Bench. As
			<lb />
			already noted above, J. Chelameswar, J. has rendered the decision on
			<lb />
			the objection. The events which followed the order of J. Chelameswar, J.,
			<lb />
			are also of some significance. In my considered view, they too need to be
			<lb />
			narrated, for only then, the entire matter can be considered to have been
			<lb />
			fully expressed, as it ought to be. I also need to record reasons, why my
			<lb />
			continuation on the reconstituted Bench, was the only course open to
			<lb />
			me. And therefore, my side of its understanding, dealing with the
			<lb />
			perception, of the other side of the Bench.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3(i) A three-Judge Bench was originally constituted for hearing these
			<lb />
			matters. The Bench comprised of Anil R. Dave, J. Chelameswar and
			<lb />
			Madan B. Lokur, JJ.. At that juncture, Anil R. Dave, J. was a part of the
			<lb />
			1+2 collegium, as also, the 1+4 collegium. The above combination heard
			<lb />
			Whereafter, the Court rose for the day. On 18.3.2015, the matter was
			<lb />
			adjourned for hearing to the following day, i.e., for 19.3.2015.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv) The order passed on 19.3.2015 reveals, that submissions were
			<lb />
			advanced on that date, by Mr. Dushyant A. Dave, Mr. Mukul Rohatgi,
			<lb />
			Mr. T.R. Andhyarujina, Senior Advocate, and Mr. Mathews J.
			<lb />
			Nedumpara. When Mr. Fali S. Nariman was still addressing the Bench,
			<lb />
			the Court rose for the day, by recording inter alia, &quot;The matters remained
			<lb />
			Part-heard.&quot; Further hearing in the cases, was deferred to 24.3.2015.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(v)
			<lb />
			On 24.3.2015, Mr. Fali S. Nariman and Mr. Anil B. Divan, were
			<lb />
			again heard. Additionally, Mr. Mukul Rohatgi concluded his submissions.
			<lb />
			On the conclusion of hearing, judgment was reserved. On 24.3.2015, a
			<lb />
			separate order was also passed in Writ Petition (C) No.124 of 2015
			<lb />
			(Mathews J. Nedumpara v. Supreme Court of India, through Secretary
			<lb />
			General and others). It read as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The application filed by Mr. Mathews J. Nedumpara to argue in person
			<lb />
			before the Court is rejected. The name of Mr. Robin Mazumdar, AOR,
			<lb />
			who was earlier appearing for him, be shown in the Cause List.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vi) On 7.4.2015, the following order came to be passed by the
			<lb />
			three-Judge Bench presided by Anil R. Dave, J.:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;1. In this group of petitions, validity of the Constitution (Ninety-Ninth
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, 2014 and the National Judicial Appointment
			<lb />
			Commission Act, 2014 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act&apos;) has been
			<lb />
			challenged. The challenge is on the ground that by virtue of the
			<lb />
			aforestated amendment and enactment of the Act, basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution of India has been altered and therefore, they should be set
			<lb />
			aside.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			2. We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and the
			<lb />
			parties appearing in-person at length.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3. It has been mainly submitted for the petitioners that all these petitions
			<lb />
			should be referred to a Bench of Five Judges as per the provisions of
			<lb />
			Article 145(3) of the Constitution of India for the reason that substantial
			<lb />
			questions of law with regard to interpretation of the Constitution of India
			<lb />
			are involved in these petitions. It has been further submitted that till all
			<lb />
			these petitions are finally disposed of, by way of an interim relief it
			<lb />
			should be directed that the Act should not be brought into force and the
			<lb />
			present system with regard to appointment of Judges should be
			<lb />
			continued.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4. Sum and substance of the submissions of the counsel opposing the
			<lb />
			petition is that all these petitions are premature for the reason that the
			<lb />
			Act has not come into force till today and till the Act comes into force,
			<lb />
			cause of action can not be said to have arisen. In the circumstances,
			<lb />
			according to the learned counsel, the petitions should be rejected.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			5. The learned counsel as well as parties in-person have relied upon
			<lb />
			several judgments to substantiate their cases.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			6. Looking at the facts of the case, we are of the view that these petitions
			<lb />
			involve substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the
			<lb />
			Constitution of India and therefore, we direct the Registry to place all the
			<lb />
			matters of this group before Hon&apos;ble the Chief Justice of India so that
			<lb />
			they can be placed before a larger Bench for its consideration.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			7. As we are not deciding the cases on merits, we do not think it
			<lb />
			appropriate to discuss the submissions made by the learned counsel and
			<lb />
			the parties in-person.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			8. It would be open to the petitioners to make a prayer for interim relief
			<lb />
			before the larger bench as we do not think it appropriate to grant any
			<lb />
			interim relief at this stage.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			During the hearing of the cases, Anil R. Dave, J. did not participate
			<lb />
			in any collegium proceedings.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			Based on the order passed by the three-Judge Bench on 7.4.2015,
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble the Chief Justice of India, constituted a five-Judge Bench,
			<lb />
			comprising of Anil R. Dave, Chelameswar, Madan B. Lokur, Kurian
			<lb />
			Joseph and Adarsh Kumar Goel, JJ.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			On 13.4.2015 the Constitution (Ninety-ninth Amendment) Act,
			<lb />
			2014, and the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014,
			<lb />
			were notified in the Gazette of India (Extraordinary). Both the above
			<lb />
			enactments, were brought into force with effect from 13.4.2015.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, on 13.4.2015 Anil R. Dave, J. became an ex officio Member
			<lb />
			of the National Judicial Appointments Commission, on account of being
			<lb />
			the second senior most Judge after the Chief Justice of India, under the
			<lb />
			mandate of Article 124A (1)(b).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			When the matter came up for hearing for the first time, before the
			<lb />
			five-Judge Bench on 15.4.2015, it passed the following order:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;List the matters before a Bench of which one of us (Anil R. Dave, J.) is
			<lb />
			not a member.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			It is, therefore, that Hon&apos;ble the Chief Justice of India, reconstituted the
			<lb />
			Bench with myself, J. Chelameswar, Madan B. Lokur, Kurian Joseph and
			<lb />
			Adarsh Kumar Goel, JJ., to hear this group of cases.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			When the reconstituted Bench commenced hearing on 21.4.2015,
			<lb />
			Mr. Fali S. Nariman made a prayer for my recusal from the Bench, which
			<lb />
			was seconded by Mr. Mathews J. Nedumpara (petitioner-in-person in
			<lb />
			Writ Petition (C) No.124 of 2015), the latter advanced submissions, even
			<lb />
			though he had been barred from doing so, by an earlier order dated
			<lb />
			24.3.2015 (extracted above). For me, to preside over the Bench seemed
			<lb />
			to be imprudent, when some of the stakeholders desired otherwise.
			<lb />
			Strong views were however expressed by quite a few learned counsel, who
			<lb />
			opposed the prayer. It was submitted, that a prayer for recusal had
			<lb />
			earlier been made, with reference to Anil R. Dave, J. It was pointed out,
			<lb />
			that the above prayer had resulted in his having exercised the option to
			<lb />
			step aside (-on 15.4.2015). Some learned counsel went to the extent of
			<lb />
			asserting, that the recusal of Anil R. Dave, J. was not only unfair, but
			<lb />
			was also motivated. It was also suggested, that the Bench should be
			<lb />
			reconstituted, by requesting Anil R. Dave, J. to preside over the Bench.
			<lb />
			The above sequence of facts reveals, that the recusal by Anil R. Dave, J.
			<lb />
			was not at his own, but in deference to a similar prayer made to him.
			<lb />
			Logically, if he had heard these cases when he was the presiding Judge of
			<lb />
			the three-Judge Bench, he would have heard it, when the Bench strength
			<lb />
			was increased, wherein, he was still the presiding Judge.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			9(i) Mr. Fali S. Nariman strongly refuted the impression sought to be
			<lb />
			created, that he had ever required Anil R. Dave, J. to recuse. In order to
			<lb />
			support his assertion, he pointed out, that he had made the following
			<lb />
			request in writing on 15.4.2015:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The provisions of the Constitution (Ninety-Ninth Amendment) Act, 2014
			<lb />
			and of the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014 have
			<lb />
			been brought into force from April 13, 2015. As a consequence, the
			<lb />
			Presiding Judge on this Bench, the Hon&apos;ble Mr. Justice Anil R. Dave, has
			<lb />
			now become (not out of choice but by force of Statute) a member ex officio
			<lb />
			of the National Judicial Appointments Commission, whose constitutional
			<lb />
			validity has been challenged.
			<lb />
			It is respectfully submitted that it would be appropriate if it is declared at
			<lb />
			the outset -by an order of this Hon&apos;ble Court -that the Presiding Judge
			<lb />
			on this Bench will take no part whatever in the proceedings of the
			<lb />
			National Judicial Appointments Commission.&quot;
			<lb />
			Learned senior counsel pointed out, that he had merely requested the
			<lb />
			then presiding Judge (Anil R. Dave, J.) not to take any part in the
			<lb />
			proceedings of the National Judicial Appointments Commission, during
			<lb />
			the hearing of these matters. He asserted, that he had never asked Anil
			<lb />
			R. Dave, J. not to hear the matters pending before the Bench.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			The submission made in writing by Mr. Mathews J. Nedumpara for
			<lb />
			the recusal of Anil R. Dave, J. was in the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;….. VI. Though Hon&apos;ble Shri Justice Anil R. Dave, who heads the
			<lb />
			Three-Judge Bench in the instant case, is a Judge revered and respected
			<lb />
			by the legal fraternity and the public at large, a Judge of the highest
			<lb />
			integrity, ability and impartiality, still the doctrine of nemo iudex in sua
			<lb />
			causa or nemo debet esse judex in propria causa -no one can be judge in
			<lb />
			his own cause -would require His Lordship to recuse himself even at this
			<lb />
			stage since in the eye of the 120 billion ordinary citizens of this country,
			<lb />
			the instant case is all about a law whereunder the exclusive power of
			<lb />
			appointment invested in the Judges case is taken away and is invested in
			<lb />
			the fair body which could lead to displeasure of the Judges and,
			<lb />
			therefore, the Supreme Court itself deciding a case involving the power of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court will not evince public
			<lb />
			credibility. The question then arises is as to who could decide it. The
			<lb />
			doctrine of necessity leaves no other option then the Supreme Court itself
			<lb />
			deciding the question. But in that case, it could be by Judges who are
			<lb />
			not part of the collegium as of today or, if an NJAC is to be constituted
			<lb />
			today, could be a member thereof. With utmost respect, Hon&apos;ble Shri
			<lb />
			Justice Dave is a member of the collegium; His Lordship will be a
			<lb />
			member of the NJAC if it is constituted today. Therefore, there is a
			<lb />
			manifest conflict of interest.
			<lb />
			VII. Referendum.
			<lb />
			In Australia, a Constitutional Amendment was
			<lb />
			brought in, limiting the retirement age of Judges to 70 years. Instead of
			<lb />
			the Judges deciding the correctness of the said decision, the validity of
			<lb />
			the amendment was left to be decided by a referendum, and 80% of the
			<lb />
			population supported the amendment. Therefore, the only body who
			<lb />
			could decide whether the NJAC as envisaged is acceptable or not is the
			<lb />
			people of this country upon a referendum.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			VIII. The judgment in Judges-2, which made the rewriting of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, is void ab initio. The said case was decided without notice
			<lb />
			to the pubic at large. Only the views of the government and Advocates on
			<lb />
			record and a few others were heard. In the instant case, the public at
			<lb />
			large ought to be afforded an opportunity to be heard; at least the major
			<lb />
			political parties, and the case should be referred to Constitutional Bench.
			<lb />
			The constitutionality of the Acts ought to be decided, brushing aside the
			<lb />
			feeble, nay, apologetical plea of the learned Attorney General that the
			<lb />
			Acts have been brought into force and their validity cannot be challenged,
			<lb />
			and failing to come forward and state in candid terms that the Acts are
			<lb />
			the will of the people, spoken through their elected representatives and
			<lb />
			that too without any division, unanimous. The plea of the Advocates on
			<lb />
			Record Association that the notification bringing into force the said Acts
			<lb />
			be stayed be rejected forthwith; so too its demand that the collegium
			<lb />
			system, which has ceased to be in existence, be allowed to be continued
			<lb />
			and appointments to the august office of Judges of High Courts and
			<lb />
			Supreme Court on its recommendation, for to do so would mean that
			<lb />
			Judges of the High Courts who are currently Chief Justices because they
			<lb />
			were appointed at a young age in preference over others will be appointed
			<lb />
			as Judges of the Supreme Court and if that is allowed to happen, it may
			<lb />
			lead to a situation where the Supreme Court tomorrow will literally be
			<lb />
			packed with sons and sons-in-law of former Judges. There are at least
			<lb />
			three Chief Justices of High Courts who are sons of former Judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court.
			<lb />
			The Petitioner is no privy to any confidential
			<lb />
			information, not even gossips. Still he believes that if the implementation
			<lb />
			of the NJAC is stayed, three sons of former Judges of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			could be appointed as Judges of the Supreme Court. The Petitioner has
			<lb />
			absolutely nothing personal against any of those Judges; the issue is not
			<lb />
			at all about any individual. The Petitioner readily concedes, and it is a
			<lb />
			pleasure to do so, that few of them are highly competent and richly
			<lb />
			deserving to be appointed.
			<lb />
			IX. Equality before law and equal protection of law in the matter of
			<lb />
			public employment. The office of the Judge of the High Court and
			<lb />
			Supreme Court, though high constitutional office, is still in the realm of
			<lb />
			public employment, to which every person eligible ought to be given an
			<lb />
			opportunity to occupy, he being selected on a transparent, just, fair and
			<lb />
			non-arbitrary system. The Petitioner reiterates that he could be least
			<lb />
			deserving to be appointed when considered along with others of more
			<lb />
			meritorious than him, but the fact that since he satisfies all the basic
			<lb />
			eligibility criteria prescribed under Articles 124A, as amended, and 217,
			<lb />
			he is entitled to seek a declaration at the hands of this Hon&apos;ble Court that
			<lb />
			an open selection be made by advertisement of vacancies or such other
			<lb />
			appropriate mechanism.
			<lb />
			X.
			<lb />
			Judicial review versus democracy.
			<lb />
			Judicial review is only to
			<lb />
			prevent unjust laws to be enacted and the rights of the minorities,
			<lb />
			whatever colour they could be in terms of religion, race, views they hold,
			<lb />
			by a legislation which enjoys brutal majority and an of the executive
			<lb />
			which is tyrannical. It is no way intended to substitute the voice of the
			<lb />
			people by the voice of the high judiciary.
			<lb />
			XI. Article 124A, as amended, is deficient only in one respect. The
			<lb />
			collegium contemplated thereunder is still fully loaded in favour of the
			<lb />
			high judiciary. Three out of the six members are Judges. In that sense it
			<lb />
			is failing to meet to be just and democratic. But the Parliament has in its
			<lb />
			wisdom enacted so and if there is a complaint, the forum is to generate
			<lb />
			public opinion and seek greater democracy. The Petitioner is currently
			<lb />
			not interested in that; he is happy with the Acts as enacted and the
			<lb />
			principal relief which he seeks in the instant petition is the immediate
			<lb />
			coming into force of the said Acts by appropriate notification and a
			<lb />
			mandamus to that effect at the hands of this Hon&apos;ble Court.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			10. When my recusal from the reconstituted Bench was sought on
			<lb />
			21.4.2015, I had expressed unequivocally, that I had no desire to hear
			<lb />
			the matters. Yet, keeping in view the reasons expressed in writing by Mr.
			<lb />
			Fali S. Nariman, with reference to Anil R. Dave, J. I had disclosed in open
			<lb />
			Court, that I had already sent a communication to Hon&apos;ble the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, that I would not participate in the proceedings of the 1+4
			<lb />
			collegium (of which I was, a member), till the disposal of these matters.
			<lb />
			Yet, the objection was pressed. It needs to be recorded that Anil R. Dave,
			<lb />
			J. was a member of the 1+2 collegium, as well as, the 1+4 collegium from
			<lb />
			the day the hearing in these matters commenced. Surprisingly, on that
			<lb />
			account, his recusal was never sought, and he had continued to hear the
			<lb />
			matters, when he was so placed (from 11.3.2015 to 7.4.2015). But for
			<lb />
			my being a member of the 1+4 collegium, a prayer had been made for my
			<lb />
			recusal.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			11. It was, and still is, my personal view, which I do not wish to thrust
			<lb />
			either on Mr. Fali S. Nariman, or on Mr. Mathews J. Nedumpara, that
			<lb />
			Anil R. Dave, J. was amongst the most suited, to preside over the
			<lb />
			reconstituted Bench. As noticed above, he was a part of the 1+2
			<lb />
			collegium, as also, the 1+4 collegium, under the &apos;collegium system&apos;; he
			<lb />
			would continue to discharge the same responsibilities, as an ex officio
			<lb />
			Member of the National Judicial Appointments Commission, in the
			<lb />
			&apos;Commission system&apos;, under the constitutional amendment enforced with
			<lb />
			effect from 13.4.2015. Therefore, irrespective of the system which would
			<lb />
			survive the adjudicatory process, Anil R. Dave, J. would participate in the
			<lb />
			selection, appointment and transfer of Judges of the higher judiciary. He
			<lb />
			would, therefore, not be affected by the determination of the present
			<lb />
			controversy, one way or the other.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			12. The prayer for my recusal from the Bench was pressed by Mr. Fali S.
			<lb />
			Nariman, Senior Advocate, in writing, as under:
			<lb />
			&quot;8. In the present case the Presiding Judge, (the Hon&apos;ble Mr. Justice J.S.
			<lb />
			Khehar) by reason of judgments reported in the Second Judges case
			<lb />
			Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Assn. v. Union of India, (1993) 4
			<lb />
			SCC 441, (reaffirmed by unanimously by a Bench of 9 Judges in the
			<lb />
			Third Judges case Special Reference No.1 of 1998, Re. (1998 7 SCC 739),
			<lb />
			is at present a member of the Collegium of five Hon&apos;ble Judges which
			<lb />
			recommends judicial appointments to the Higher Judiciary, which will
			<lb />
			now come under the ambit of the National Judicial Appointments
			<lb />
			Commission set up under the aegis of the Constitution (Ninety-ninth
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, 2014 read with National Judicial Appointments
			<lb />
			Commission Act No.40 of 2014 -if valid; but the constitutional validity of
			<lb />
			these enactments has been directly challenged in these proceedings.
			<lb />
			The position of the Presiding Judge on this Bench hearing these cases of
			<lb />
			constitutional challenge is not consistent with (and apparently conflicts
			<lb />
			with) his position as a member of the &apos;collegium&apos;; and is likely to be seen
			<lb />
			as such; always bearing in mind that if the Constitution Amendment and
			<lb />
			the statute pertaining thereto are held constitutionally valid and are
			<lb />
			upheld, the present presiding Judge would no longer be part of the
			<lb />
			Collegium -the Collegium it must be acknowledged exercises significant
			<lb />
			constitutional power.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			In other words would it be inappropriate for the Hon&apos;ble Presiding
			<lb />
			Judge to continue to sit on a Bench that adjudicates whether the
			<lb />
			Collegium system, (as it is in place for the past two decades and is stated
			<lb />
			(in the writ petitions) to be a part of the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution), should continue or not continue. The impression in
			<lb />
			peoples mind would be that it is inappropriate if not unfair if a sitting
			<lb />
			member of a Collegium sits in judgment over a scheme that seeks to
			<lb />
			replace it. This is apart from a consideration as to whether or not the
			<lb />
			judgment is (or is not) ultimately declared invalid or void: whether in the
			<lb />
			first instance or by Review or in a Curative Petition.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			The above prayer for my recusal was supported by Mr. Mathews J.
			<lb />
			Nedumpara, petitioner-in-person, in writing, as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;…..Hon&apos;ble Shri Justice J.S. Khehar, the presiding Judge, a Judge
			<lb />
			whom the Petitioner holds in high esteem and respect, a Judge known for
			<lb />
			his uprightness, impartiality and erudition, the Petitioner is afraid to say,
			<lb />
			ought not to preside over the Constitution Bench deciding the
			<lb />
			constitutional validity or otherwise of the Constitution (Ninety-ninth
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, 2014 and the National Judicial Appointments
			<lb />
			Commission Act, 2014 (&quot;the said Acts&quot;, for short). His Lordship will be a
			<lb />
			member of the collegium if this Hon&apos;ble Court were to hold that the said
			<lb />
			Acts are unconstitutional or to stay the operation of the said Acts, for, if
			<lb />
			the operation of the Acts is stayed, it is likely to be construed that the
			<lb />
			collegium system continues to be in force by virtue of such stay order.
			<lb />
			Though Hon&apos;ble Shri Justice J.S. Khehar is not a member of the National
			<lb />
			Judicial Appointments Commission, for, if the NJAC is to be constituted
			<lb />
			today, it will be consisting of the Hon&apos;ble Chief Justice of India and two
			<lb />
			seniormost Judges of this Hon&apos;ble Court. With the retirement of Hon&apos;ble
			<lb />
			Shri H.L. Dattu, Chief Justice of India, His Lordship Hon&apos;ble Shri Justice
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			J.S. Khehar will become a member of the collegium. Therefore, an
			<lb />
			ordinary man, nay, an informed onlooker, an expression found
			<lb />
			acceptance at the hands of this Hon&apos;ble Court on the question of judicial
			<lb />
			recusal, will consider that justice would not have been done if a Bench of
			<lb />
			this Hon&apos;ble Court headed by Hon&apos;ble Shri Justice J.S. Khehar were to
			<lb />
			hear the above case. For a not so informed onlooker, the layman, the
			<lb />
			aam aadmi, this Hon&apos;ble Court hearing the Writ Petitions challenging the
			<lb />
			aforesaid Acts is nothing but a fox being on the jury at a goose&apos;s trial.
			<lb />
			The Petitioner believes that the Noble heart of his Lordships Justice
			<lb />
			Khehar could unwittingly be influenced by the nonconscious,
			<lb />
			subconscious, unconscious bias, his Lordships having been placed
			<lb />
			himself in a position of conflict of interest.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3.
			<lb />
			This Hon&apos;ble Court itself hearing the case involving the power of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges between the collegium and the Government, nay,
			<lb />
			the executive, will not evince any public confidence, except the
			<lb />
			designated senior lawyers who seem to be supporting the collegium
			<lb />
			system. The collegium system does not have any confidence in the
			<lb />
			ordinary lawyers who are often unfairly treated nor the ordinary litigants,
			<lb />
			the Daridra Narayanas, to borrow an expression from legendary Justice
			<lb />
			Krishna Iyer, who considered that the higher judiciary, and the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in particular, is beyond the reach of the ordinary man. An
			<lb />
			ordinary lawyer finds it difficult to get even an entry into the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court premises. This is the stark reality, though many prefer to pretend
			<lb />
			not to notice it. Therefore, the Petitioner with utmost respect, while
			<lb />
			literally worshipping the majesty of this Hon&apos;ble Court, so too the Hon&apos;ble
			<lb />
			presiding Judge of this Hon&apos;ble Court, in all humility, with an apology, if
			<lb />
			the Petitioner has erred in making this plea, seeks recusal by Hon&apos;ble
			<lb />
			Shri Justice J.S. Khehar from hearing the above case.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			13. As a Judge presiding over the reconstituted Bench, I found myself
			<lb />
			in an awkward predicament. I had no personal desire to participate in
			<lb />
			the hearing of these matters. I was a part of the Bench, because of my
			<lb />
			nomination to it, by Hon&apos;ble the Chief Justice of India. My recusal from
			<lb />
			the Bench at the asking of Mr. Fali S. Nariman, whom I hold in great
			<lb />
			esteem, did not need a second thought. It is not as if the prayer made by
			<lb />
			Mr. Mathews J. Nedumpara, was inconsequential.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			14. But then, this was the second occasion when proceedings in a
			<lb />
			matter would have been deferred, just because, Hon&apos;ble the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India, in the first instance, had nominated Anil R. Dave, J. on the
			<lb />
			Bench, and thereafter, had substituted him by nominating me to the
			<lb />
			Bench. It was therefore felt, that reasons ought to be recorded, after
			<lb />
			hearing learned counsel, at least for the guidance of Hon&apos;ble the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, so that His Lordship may not make another nomination
			<lb />
			to the Bench, which may be similarly objected to. This, coupled with the
			<lb />
			submissions advanced by Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, Mr. Harish N. Salve and
			<lb />
			Mr. K.K. Venugopal, that parameters should be laid down, led to a
			<lb />
			hearing, on the issue of recusal.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			15. On the basis of the submissions advanced by the learned counsel,
			<lb />
			the Bench examined the prayer, whether I should remain on the
			<lb />
			reconstituted Bench, despite my being a member of the 1+4 collegium.
			<lb />
			The Bench, unanimously concluded, that there was no conflict of
			<lb />
			interest, and no other justifiable reason in law, for me to recuse from the
			<lb />
			hearing of these matters. On 22.4.2015, the Bench passed the following
			<lb />
			short order, which was pronounced by J. Chelameswar, J.:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;A preliminary objection, whether Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar should
			<lb />
			preside over this Bench, by virtue of his being the fourth senior most
			<lb />
			Judge of this Court, also happens to be a member of the collegium, was
			<lb />
			raised by the petitioners. Elaborate submissions were made by the
			<lb />
			learned counsel for the petitioners and the respondents. After hearing all
			<lb />
			the learned counsel, we are of the unanimous opinion that we do not see
			<lb />
			any reason in law requiring Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar to recuse
			<lb />
			himself from hearing the matter. Reasons will follow.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16. After the order was pronounced, I disclosed to my colleagues on the
			<lb />
			Bench, that I was still undecided whether I should remain on the Bench,
			<lb />
			for I was toying with the idea of recusal, because a prayer to that effect,
			<lb />
			had been made in the face of the Court. My colleagues on the Bench,
			<lb />
			would have nothing of it. They were unequivocal in their protestation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			17. Despite the factual position noticed above, I wish to record, that it
			<lb />
			is not their persuasion or exhortation, which made me take a final call on
			<lb />
			the matter. The decision to remain a member of the reconstituted Bench
			<lb />
			was mine, and mine alone. The choice that I made, was not of the heart,
			<lb />
			but that of the head. The choice was made by posing two questions to
			<lb />
			myself. Firstly, whether a Judge hearing a matter should recuse, even
			<lb />
			though the prayer for recusal is found to be unjustified and
			<lb />
			unwarranted? Secondly, whether I would stand true to the oath of my
			<lb />
			office, if I recused from hearing the matters?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			18. The reason that was pointed out against me, for seeking my recusal
			<lb />
			was, that I was a part of the 1+4 collegium. But that, should have been a
			<lb />
			disqualification for Anil R. Dave, J. as well. When he commenced hearing
			<lb />
			of the matters, and till 7.4.2015, he suffered the same alleged
			<lb />
			disqualification. Yet, the objection raised against me, was not raised
			<lb />
			against him. When confronted, Mr. Fali S. Nariman vociferously
			<lb />
			contested, that he had not sought the recusal of Anil R. Dave, J.. He
			<lb />
			supported his assertion with proof. One wonders, why did he not seek
			<lb />
			the recusal of Anil R. Dave, J.? There is no doubt about the fact, that I
			<lb />
			have been a member of the 1+4 collegium, and it is likely that I would
			<lb />
			also shortly become a Member of the NJAC, if the present challenge
			<lb />
			raised by the petitioners was not to succeed. I would therefore remain a
			<lb />
			part of the selection procedure, irrespective of the process which prevails.
			<lb />
			That however is the position with reference to four of us (on the instant
			<lb />
			five-Judge Bench). Besides me, my colleagues on the Bench -J.
			<lb />
			Chelameswar, Madan B. Lokur and Kurian Joseph, JJ. would in due
			<lb />
			course be a part of the collegium (if the writ-petitioners before this Court
			<lb />
			were to succeed), or alternatively, would be a part of the NJAC (if the
			<lb />
			writ-petitioners were to fail). In such eventuality, the averment of conflict
			<lb />
			of interest, ought to have been raised not only against me, but also
			<lb />
			against my three colleagues. But, that was not the manner in which the
			<lb />
			issue has been canvassed. In my considered view, the prayer for my
			<lb />
			recusal is not well founded. If I were to accede to the prayer for my
			<lb />
			recusal, I would be initiating a wrong practice, and laying down a wrong
			<lb />
			precedent. A Judge may recuse at his own, from a case entrusted to him
			<lb />
			by the Chief Justice. That would be a matter of his own choosing. But
			<lb />
			recusal at the asking of a litigating party, unless justified, must never to
			<lb />
			be acceded to. For that would give the impression, of the Judge had been
			<lb />
			scared out of the case, just by the force of the objection. A Judge before
			<lb />
			he assumes his office, takes an oath to discharge his duties without fear
			<lb />
			or favour. He would breach his oath of office, if he accepts a prayer for
			<lb />
			recusal, unless justified. It is my duty to discharge my responsibility with
			<lb />
			absolute earnestness and sincerity. It is my duty to abide by my oath of
			<lb />
			office, to uphold the Constitution and the laws. My decision to continue
			<lb />
			to be a part of the Bench, flows from the oath which I took, at the time of
			<lb />
			my elevation to this Court.

			THE REFERENCE ORDER
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			I.
			<lb />
			THE CHALLENGE:
			<lb />
			1.
			<lb />
			The question which has arisen for consideration, in the present set
			<lb />
			of cases, pertains to the constitutional validity of the Constitution
			<lb />
			(Ninety-ninth Amendment) Act, 2014 (hereinafter referred to as, the
			<lb />
			Constitution (99th Amendment) Act), as also, that of the National
			<lb />
			Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014 (hereinafter referred to as,
			<lb />
			the NJAC Act).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			2.
			<lb />
			During the course of hearing on the merits of the controversy,
			<lb />
			which pertains to the selection and appointment of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary (i.e., Chief Justices and Judges of the High Courts and the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court), and the transfer of Chief Justices and Judges of one
			<lb />
			High Court to another, it emerged that learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			respondents, were inter alia relying on the judgment rendered in S.P.
			<lb />
			Gupta v. Union of India 1 , (hereinafter referred to as, the First Judges
			<lb />
			case); whereas, the learned counsel for the petitioners were inter alia
			<lb />
			relying on the judgment in Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record
			<lb />
			Association v. Union of India 2 (hereinafter referred to as, the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case), and the judgment in Re: Special Reference No.1 of 1998 3 ,
			<lb />
			(hereinafter referred to as, the Third Judges case).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3.
			<lb />
			Per se, the stance adopted by learned counsel for the respondents
			<lb />
			in placing reliance on the judgment in the First Judges case, was not
			<lb />
			open to them. This, for the simple reason, that the judgment rendered in
			<lb />
			the First Judges case, had been overruled by a larger Bench, in the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case. And furthermore, the exposition of law declared in
			<lb />
			the Second Judges case, was reaffirmed by the Third Judges case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			Visualizing, that the position adopted by the respondents, was not
			<lb />
			legally permissible, the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, and other
			<lb />
			learned counsel representing the respondents, adopted the only course
			<lb />
			open to them, namely, to seek reconsideration of the decisions rendered
			<lb />
			by this Court in the Second and Third Judges cases. For the above
			<lb />
			objective it was asserted, that various vital aspects of the matter, had not
			<lb />
			been brought to the notice of this Court, when the controversy raised in
			<lb />
			the Second Judges case was canvassed. It was contended that, had the
			<lb />
			controversy raised in the Second Judges case, been examined in the right
			<lb />
			perspective, this Court would not have recorded the conclusions
			<lb />
			expressed therein, by the majority. It was submitted, that till the
			<lb />
			respondents were not permitted to air their submissions, with reference
			<lb />
			to the unacceptability of the judgments rendered in the Second and Third
			<lb />
			Judges cases, it would not be in the fitness of matters, for this Court to
			<lb />
			dispose of the present controversy, by placing reliance on the said
			<lb />
			judgments.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			Keeping in mind the importance and the sensitivity of the
			<lb />
			controversy being debated, as also, the vehemence with which learned
			<lb />
			counsel representing the respondents, pressed for a re-examination of
			<lb />
			the judgments rendered by this Court, in the Second and Third Judges
			<lb />
			cases, we permitted them, to detail the basis of their assertions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			Before embarking on the issue, namely, whether the judgments
			<lb />
			rendered by this Court in the Second and Third Judges cases, needed to
			<lb />
			be revisited, we propose first of all, to determine whether or not it would
			<lb />
			be justified for us, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case,
			<lb />
			keeping in view the technical parameters laid down by this Court, to
			<lb />
			undertake the task. In case, we conclude negatively, and hold that the
			<lb />
			prayer seeking a review of the two judgments was not justified, that
			<lb />
			would render a quietus to the matter. However, even if the proposition
			<lb />
			canvassed at the behest of the respondents is not accepted, we would
			<lb />
			still examine the submissions canvassed at their behest, as in a matter of
			<lb />
			such extreme importance and sensitivity, it may not be proper to reject a
			<lb />
			prayer for review, on a mere technicality. We shall then endeavour to
			<lb />
			determine, whether the submissions canvassed at the hands of the
			<lb />
			respondents, demonstrate clear and compelling reasons, for a review of
			<lb />
			the conclusions recorded in the Second and Third Judges cases. We
			<lb />
			shall also venture to examine, whether the respondents have been able to
			<lb />
			prima facie show, that the earlier judgments could be seen as manifestly
			<lb />
			incorrect. For such preliminary adjudication, we are satisfied, that the
			<lb />
			present bench-strength satisfies the postulated requirement, expressed
			<lb />
			in the proviso under Article 145(3).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			Consequent upon the above examination, if the judgments rendered
			<lb />
			in the Second and Third Judges cases, are shown to prima facie require a
			<lb />
			re-look, we would then delve on the merits of the main controversy,
			<lb />
			without permitting the petitioners to place reliance on either of the
			<lb />
			aforesaid two judgments.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			In case, we do not accept the submissions advanced at the hands of
			<lb />
			the petitioners on merits, with reference to the main controversy, that too
			<lb />
			in a sense would conclude the matter, as the earlier regime governed by
			<lb />
			the Second and Third Judges cases, would become a historical event, of
			<lb />
			the past, as the new scheme contemplated under the impugned
			<lb />
			Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, along with the NJAC Act, would
			<lb />
			replace the earlier dispensation. In the above eventuality, the question of
			<lb />
			re-examination of the Second and Third Judges cases would be only
			<lb />
			academic, and therefore uncalled for.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			However, if we accept the submissions advanced at the hands of
			<lb />
			the learned counsel for the petitioners, resulting in the revival of the
			<lb />
			earlier process, and simultaneously conclude in favour of the
			<lb />
			respondents, that the Second and Third Judges cases need a re-look, we
			<lb />
			would be obliged to refer this matter to a nine-Judge Bench (or even, to a
			<lb />
			larger Bench), for re-examining the judgments rendered in the Second
			<lb />
			and Third Judges cases.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			II.
			<lb />
			THE BACKGROUND TO THE CHALLENGE:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			10. Judges to the Supreme Court of India and High Courts of States,
			<lb />
			are appointed under Articles 124 and 217 respectively. Additional Judges
			<lb />
			and acting Judges for High Courts are appointed under Articles 224 and
			<lb />
			224A. The transfer of High Court Judges and Chief Justices, of one High
			<lb />
			Court to another, is made under Article 222. For the controversy in
			<lb />
			hand, it is essential to extract the original Articles 124 and 217,
			<lb />
			hereunder:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;124. Establishment and constitution of Supreme Court. (1) There shall

			Explanation II.-In computing for the purpose of this clause the period
			<lb />
			during which a person has been an advocate, any period during which a
			<lb />

			<lb />
			he became an advocate shall be included.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(4) A Judge of the Supreme Court shall not be removed from his office
			<lb />
			except by an order of the President passed after an address by each
			<lb />
			House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of

			acting Judge, as provided in article 224, and in any other case, until he
			<lb />
			attains the age of sixty-two years:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Provided that-

			Explanation.-For the purposes of this clause -
			<lb />
			(a) in computing the period during which a person has held judicial office
			<lb />
			in the territory of India, there shall be included any period, after he has
			<lb />
			held any judicial office, during which the person has been an advocate of
			<lb />
			a High Court or has held the office of a member of a tribunal or any post,
			<lb />
			under the Union or a State, requiring special knowledge of law;
			<lb />
			(aa) in computing the period during which a person has been an advocate
			<lb />
			of a High Court, there shall be included any period during which the
			<lb />
			person has held judicial office or the office of a member of a tribunal or
			<lb />
			any post, under the Union or a State, requiring special knowledge of law
			<lb />
			after he became an advocate;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(b) in computing the period during which a person has held judicial office
			<lb />
			in the territory of India or been an advocate of High Court, there shall be
			<lb />
			included any period before the commencement of this Constitution
			<lb />
			during which he has held judicial office in any area which was comprised
			<lb />
			before the fifteenth day of August, 1947, within India as defined by the
			<lb />
			Government of India Act, 1935, or has been an advocate of any High
			<lb />
			Court in any such area, as the case may be.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(3) If any question arises as to the age of a Judge of a High Court, the
			<lb />
			question shall be decided by the President after consultation with the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India and the decision of the President shall be final.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			11. The true effect and intent of the provisions of the Constitution, and
			<lb />
			all other legislative enactments made by the Parliament, and the State
			<lb />
			legislatures, are understood in the manner they are interpreted and
			<lb />
			declared by the Supreme Court, under Article 141. The manner in which
			<lb />
			Articles 124 and 217 were interpreted by this Court, emerges principally
			<lb />
			from three-Constitution Bench judgments of this Court, which are now
			<lb />
			under pointed consideration. The first judgment was rendered, by a
			<lb />
			seven-Judge Bench, by a majority of 4:3, in the First Judges case on
			<lb />
			30.12.1981. The correctness of the First Judges case was doubted by a
			<lb />
			three-Judge Bench in Subhash Sharma v. Union of India 4 , which opined
			<lb />
			that the majority view, in the First Judges case, should be considered by
			<lb />
			a larger Bench. The Chief Justice of India constituted a nine-Judge
			<lb />
			Bench, to examine two questions. Firstly, whether the opinion of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India in regard to the appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court and to the High Courts, as well as, transfer of Chief
			<lb />
			Justices and Judges of High Courts, was entitled to primacy? And
			<lb />
			secondly, whether the fixation of the judge-strength in High Courts, was
			<lb />
			justiciable? By a majority of 7:2, a nine-Judge Bench of this Court, in the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case, overruled the judgment in the First Judges case.
			<lb />
			The instant judgment was rendered on 6.10.1993. Consequent upon
			<lb />
			doubts having arisen with the Union of India, about the interpretation of
			<lb />
			the Second Judges case, the President of India, in exercise of his power
			<lb />
			under Article 143, referred nine questions to the Supreme Court, for its
			<lb />
			opinion. A nine-Judge Bench answered the reference unanimously, on
			<lb />
			28.10.1998.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			12. After the judgment of this Court in the Second Judges case was
			<lb />
			rendered in 1993, and the advisory opinion of this Court was tendered to
			<lb />
			the President of India in 1998, the term &quot;consultation&quot; in Articles 124(2)
			<lb />
			and 217(1), relating to appointment (as well as, transfer) of Judges of the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, commenced to be interpreted as vesting primacy in the
			<lb />
			matter, with the judiciary. This according to the respondents, had
			<lb />
			resulted in the term &quot;consultation&quot; being understood as &quot;concurrence&quot; (in
			<lb />
			matters governed by Articles 124, 217 and 222). The Union of India,
			<lb />
			then framed a Memorandum of Procedure on 30.6.1999, for the
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges and Chief Justices to the High Courts and the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court, in consonance with the above two judgments. And
			<lb />
			appointments came to be made thereafter, in consonance with the
			<lb />
			Memorandum of Procedure.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			13. As per the position expressed before us, a feeling came to be
			<lb />
			entertained, that a Commission for selection and appointment, as also
			<lb />
			for transfer, of Judges of the higher judiciary should be constituted,
			<lb />
			which would replace the prevailing procedure, for appointment of Judges
			<lb />
			and Chief Justices of the High Courts and the Supreme Court of India,
			<lb />
			contemplated under Articles 124(2) and 217(1). It was felt, that the
			<lb />
			proposed Commission should be broad based. In that, the Commission
			<lb />
			should comprise of members of the judiciary, the executive and
			<lb />
			eminent/important persons from public life. In the above manner, it was
			<lb />
			proposed to introduce transparency in the selection process.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			14. To achieve the purported objective, Articles 124 and 217 were inter
			<lb />
			alia amended, and Articles 124A, 124B and 124C were inserted in the
			<lb />
			Constitution, through the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, by
			<lb />
			following the procedure contemplated under Article 368(2), more
			<lb />
			particularly, the proviso thereunder. The amendment, received the assent
			<lb />
			of the President on 31.12.2014. It was however given effect to, with effect
			<lb />
			from 13.4.2015 (consequent upon its notification in the Gazette of India
			<lb />
			(Extraordinary) Part II, Section 1). Simultaneously therewith, the
			<lb />
			Parliament enacted the NJAC Act, which also received the assent of the
			<lb />
			President on 31.12.2014. The same was also brought into force, with
			<lb />
			effect from 13.4.2015 (by its notification in the Gazette of India
			<lb />
			(Extraordinary) Part II, Section 1). The above constitutional amendment
			<lb />
			and the legislative enactment, are subject matter of challenge through a
			<lb />
			bunch of petitions, which are collectively being heard by us. In order to
			<lb />
			effectively understand the true purport of the challenge raised by the
			<lb />
			petitioners, and the nuances of the legal and constitutional issues
			<lb />
			involved, it is imperative to have a bird&apos;s eye view of the First Judges
			<lb />
			case, upon which reliance has been placed by the learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			respondents, in their attempt to seek a review of the Second and Third
			<lb />
			Judges cases.

		<p>
			15. The Union Law Minister addressed a letter dated 18.3.1981 to the
			<lb />
			Governor of Punjab and to Chief Ministers of all other States. The
			<lb />
			addressees were inter alia informed, that &quot;…one third of the Judges of
			<lb />
			High Court, should as far as possible be from outside the State in which
			<lb />
			the High Court is situated…&quot;. Through the above letter, the addressees
			<lb />
			were requested to &quot;…(a) obtain from all additional Judges working in the
			<lb />
			High Courts… their consent to be appointed as permanent Judges in any
			<lb />
			other High Court in the country…&quot; The above noted letter required, that
			<lb />
			the concerned appointees &quot;…be required to name three High Courts, in
			<lb />
			order of preference, to which they would prefer to be appointed as
			<lb />
			permanent Judges; and (b) obtain from persons who have already been
			<lb />
			or may in the future be proposed by you for initial appointment their
			<lb />
			consent to be appointed to any other High Court in the country along
			<lb />
			with a similar preference for three High Courts…&quot;. The Union Law
			<lb />
			Minister, in the above letter clarified, that furnishing of their consent or
			<lb />
			indication of their preference, would not imply any commitment, at the
			<lb />
			behest of the Government, to accommodate them in accordance with
			<lb />
			their preferences. In response, quite a few additional Judges, gave their
			<lb />
			consent to be appointed outside their parent State.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Iqbal Chagla (and the other petitioners) felt, that the letter dated
			<lb />
			18.3.1981 was a direct attack on the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, and
			<lb />
			an uninhibited assault on a vital/basic feature of the Constitution. A
			<lb />
			series of Advocates&apos; Associations in Bombay passed resolutions,
			<lb />
			condemning the letter dated 18.3.1981, as being subversive of &quot;judicial
			<lb />
			independence&quot;. They demanded the withdrawal of the letter. Since that
			<lb />
			was not done, a writ petition was filed by the above Associations in the
			<lb />
			Bombay High Court, challenging the letter dated 18.3.1981. An interim
			<lb />
			order was passed by the High Court, restraining the Union Law Minister
			<lb />
			and the Government from implementing the letter dated 18.3.1981. A
			<lb />
			Letters Patent Appeal preferred against the above interim order, came to
			<lb />
			be dismissed by a Division Bench of the High Court. The above interim
			<lb />
			order, was assailed before this Court. While the matter was pending
			<lb />
			before this Court, the Union Law Minister and the Government of India,
			<lb />
			filed a transfer petition under Article 139A. The transfer petition was
			<lb />
			allowed, and the writ petition filed in the Bombay High Court, was
			<lb />
			transferred to the Supreme Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			A second petition was filed by V.M. Tarkunde, in the High Court of
			<lb />
			Delhi. It raised a challenge to the constitutional validity of the letter
			<lb />
			dated 18.3.1981. One additional ground was raised with reference to the
			<lb />
			three additional Judges of the Delhi High Court, namely, O.N. Vohra,
			<lb />
			S.N. Kumar and S.B. Wad, JJ., whose term was expiring on 6.3.1981.
			<lb />
			Rather than being appointed for a further term of two years, their
			<lb />
			appointment was extended for three months, from 7.3.1981. These short
			<lb />
			term appointments were assailed, as being unjustified under Article 224,
			<lb />
			besides being subversive of the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. This writ
			<lb />
			petition was also transferred for hearing to the Supreme Court. So far as
			<lb />
			the circular letter dated 18.3.1981 is concerned, the Supreme Court, on
			<lb />
			an oral prayer made by the petitioner, directed that any additional Judge
			<lb />
			who did not wish to respond to the circular letter may not do so, and
			<lb />
			that, he would neither be refused extension nor permanent appointment,
			<lb />
			on the ground that he had not sent a reply to the letter dated 18.3.1981.
			<lb />
			Thereafter, the appointment of S.B. Wad, J., was continued, as an
			<lb />
			additional Judge for a period of one year from 7.6.1981, but O.N. Vohra
			<lb />
			and S.N. Kumar, JJ., were not continued beyond 7.6.1981.
			<lb />
			(iii &amp; iv). A third writ petition, was filed by J.L. Kalra and others, who
			<lb />
			were practicing Advocates, in the Delhi High Court. And a fourth writ
			<lb />
			petition was filed by S.P. Gupta, a practicing Advocate, of the Allahabad
			<lb />
			High Court. The third and fourth writ petitions were for substantially the
			<lb />
			same reliefs, as the earlier two petitions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(v)
			<lb />
			A fifth writ petition, was filed by Lily Thomas. She challenged a
			<lb />
			transfer order dated 19.1.1981, whereby the Chief Justice of the High
			<lb />
			Court of Madras was transferred as the Chief Justice of the High Court of
			<lb />
			Kerala. The above order had been passed by the President, under Article
			<lb />
			222(1), after consultation with the Chief Justice of India. Likewise, the
			<lb />
			transfer of the Chief Justice of the High Court of Patna to the Madras
			<lb />
			High Court was challenged by asserting, that the power of transfer under
			<lb />
			Article 222(1) was limited to Judges of the High Courts, and did not
			<lb />
			extend to Chief Justices. Alternatively, it was contended, that transfers
			<lb />
			could only be made with the consent of the concerned Judge, and only in
			<lb />
			public interest, and after full and effective consultation with the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vi &amp; vii)
			<lb />
			A sixth writ petition was filed by A. Rajappa, principally
			<lb />
			challenging the order dated 19.1.1981, whereby some Chief Justices had
			<lb />
			been transferred. One additional submission was raised in this petition,
			<lb />
			namely, that the transfer of the Chief Justices had been made without
			<lb />
			the prior consultation of the Governors of the concerned States, and
			<lb />
			further, that the said transfers were not in public interest, and therefore,
			<lb />
			violated the procedural requirements contained in Article 217(1). The
			<lb />
			seventh writ petition was filed by P. Subramanian, on the same grounds,
			<lb />
			as the petition filed by A. Rajappa.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(viii) An eighth writ petition was filed by D.N. Pandey and Thakur
			<lb />
			Ramapati Sinha, practicing Advocates, of the Patna High Court. In this
			<lb />
			petition, Justice K.B.N. Singh, the Chief Justice of the Patna High Court
			<lb />
			was impleaded as respondent no.3. On a prayer made by respondent
			<lb />
			no.3, he was transposed as petitioner no.3. As petitioner no.3, Justice
			<lb />
			K.B.N. Singh filed a detailed affidavit asserting, that his transfer had
			<lb />
			been made as a matter of punishment, and further, that it had been
			<lb />
			made on irrelevant and on insufficient grounds, and not in public
			<lb />
			interest. And further that, it was not preceded by a full and effective
			<lb />
			consultation with the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
			It is therefore apparent, that the above mentioned petitions related to two
			<lb />
			different sets of cases. Firstly, the issue pertaining to the initial
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges, and the extension of the term of appointment of
			<lb />
			additional Judges, on the expiry of their original term. And secondly, the
			<lb />
			transfer of Judges and Chief Justices from one High Court to another.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16. The opinions recorded in the First Judges case, insofar as they are
			<lb />
			relevant to the present controversy, are being summarized herein:
			<lb />
			P.N. Bhagwati, J. (as he then was):
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			On the subject of independence of the judiciary, it was opined, that
			<lb />
			&quot;…The concept of independence of judiciary is a noble concept which
			<lb />
			inspires the constitutional scheme and constitutes the foundation on
			<lb />
			which rests the edifice of our democratic polity. If there is one principle
			<lb />
			which runs through the entire fabric of the entire Constitution, it is the
			<lb />
			principle of the rule of law and under the Constitution, it is the judiciary
			<lb />
			which is entrusted with the task of keeping every organ of the State
			<lb />
			within the limits of the law and thereby making the rule of law
			<lb />
			meaningful and effective…The judiciary stands between the citizen and
			<lb />
			the State as a bulwark against executive excesses and misuse or abuse of
			<lb />
			power by the executive, and therefore, it is absolutely essential that the
			<lb />
			judiciary must be free from executive pressure or influence and this has
			<lb />
			been secured by the Constitution makers by making elaborate provisions
			<lb />
			in the Constitution. &quot;…It was felt, that the concept of &quot;independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary&quot; was not limited only to the independence from executive
			<lb />
			pressure or influence, but it was a much wider concept, which took
			<lb />
			within its sweep, independence from many other pressures and
			<lb />
			prejudices. It had many dimensions, namely, fearlessness of other power
			<lb />
			centers, economic or political, and freedom from prejudices acquired and
			<lb />
			nourished by the class to which the Judges belong. It was held, that the
			<lb />
			principle of &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; had to be kept in mind, while
			<lb />
			interpreting the provisions of the Constitution (paragraph 27).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii). On the subject of appointment of High Court Judges, it was opined,
			<lb />
			that just like Supreme Court Judges, who are appointed under Article
			<lb />
			124 by the President (which in effect and substance meant the Central
			<lb />
			Government), likewise, the power of appointment of High Court Judges
			<lb />
			under Article 217, was to be exercised by the Central Government. Such
			<lb />
			power, it was held, was exercisable only &quot;…after consultation with the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India, the Governor of the State, and, the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			the High Court…&quot; It was concluded, that it was clear on a plain reading
			<lb />
			of the above two Articles, that the Chief Justice of India, the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of the High Court, and such other Judges of the High Court and of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court (as the Central Government may deem necessary to
			<lb />
			consult), were constitutional functionaries, having a consultative role,
			<lb />
			and the power of appointments rested solely and exclusively in the
			<lb />
			decision of the Central Government. It was pointed out, that the above
			<lb />
			power was not an unfettered power, in the sense, that the Central
			<lb />
			Government could not act arbitrarily, without consulting the
			<lb />
			constitutional functionaries specified in the two Articles. The Central
			<lb />
			Government was to act, only after consulting the constitutional
			<lb />
			functionaries, and that, the consultation had to be full and effective
			<lb />
			(paragraph 29).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii). On the question of the meaning of the term &quot;consultation&quot;
			<lb />
			expressed in Article 124(2) and Article 217(1), it was held, that this
			<lb />
			question was no longer res integra, as the issue stood concluded by the
			<lb />
			decision of the Supreme Court in Union of India v. Sankalchand Himatlal
			<lb />
			Sheth 5 , wherein its meaning was determined with reference to Article
			<lb />
			222(1). But, since it was the common ground between the parties, that
			<lb />
			the term &quot;consultation&quot; used in Article 222(1) had the same meaning,
			<lb />
			which it had in Articles 124(2) and 217(1), it was held that, &quot;…therefore,
			<lb />
			it follows that the President must communicate to the Chief Justice all
			<lb />
			the material he has and the course he proposes. The Chief Justice, in
			<lb />
			turn, must collect necessary information through responsible channels
			<lb />
			or directly, acquaint himself with the requisite data, deliberate on the
			<lb />
			information he possesses and proceed in the interests of the
			<lb />
			administration of justice to give the President such counsel of action as
			<lb />
			he thinks will further the public interest, especially the cause of the
			<lb />
			justice system…&quot; It was further concluded, that the above observation in
			<lb />
			the Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth case 5 would apply with equal force to
			<lb />
			determine the scope and meaning of the term &quot;consultation&quot; within the
			<lb />
			meaning of Articles 124(2) and 217(1). Each of the constitutional
			<lb />
			functionaries, required to be consulted under these two Articles, must
			<lb />
			have for his consideration, full and identical facts bearing upon
			<lb />
			appointment or non-appointment of the person concerned, and the
			<lb />
			opinion of each of them taken on identical material, must be considered
			<lb />
			by the Central Government, before it takes a decision, whether or not to
			<lb />
			appoint the person concerned as a Judge. It was open to the Central
			<lb />
			Government to take its own decision, in regard to the appointment or
			<lb />
			non-appointment of a Judge to a High Court or the Supreme Court, after
			<lb />
			taking into account and giving due weight to, the opinions expressed. It
			<lb />
			was also observed, that the only ground on which such a decision could
			<lb />
			be assailed was, that the action was based on mala fides or irrelevant
			<lb />
			considerations. In case of a difference of opinion amongst the
			<lb />
			constitutional functionaries, who were to be consulted, it was felt, that it
			<lb />
			was for the Central Government to decide, whose opinion should be
			<lb />
			accepted. The contention raised on behalf of the petitioners, that in the
			<lb />
			consultative process, primacy should be that of the Chief Justice of India,
			<lb />
			since he was the head of the Indian judiciary and pater familias of the
			<lb />
			judicial fraternity, was rejected for the reason, that each of the
			<lb />
			constitutional functionaries was entitled to equal weightage. With
			<lb />
			reference to appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court, it was held,
			<lb />
			that the Chief Justice of India was required to be consulted, but the
			<lb />
			Central Government was not bound to act in accordance with the opinion
			<lb />
			of the Chief Justice of India, even though, his opinion was entitled to
			<lb />
			great weight. It was therefore held, that the ultimate power of
			<lb />
			appointment, rested
			<lb />
			with the Central
			<lb />
			Government (paragraph
			<lb />
			30).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv). On the issue of appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court, it
			<lb />
			was concluded, that consultation with the Chief Justice of India was a
			<lb />
			mandatory requirement. But while making an appointment, consultation
			<lb />
			could extend to such other Judges of the Supreme Court, and of the High
			<lb />
			Courts, as the Central Government may deem necessary. In response to
			<lb />
			the submission, where only the Chief Justice of India was consulted (i.e.,
			<lb />
			when consultation did not extend to other Judges of the Supreme Court,
			<lb />
			or of the High Courts), whether the opinion tendered by the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India should be treated as binding, it was opined, that there was
			<lb />
			bound to be consultation, with one or more of the Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court and of the High Courts, before exercising the power of appointment
			<lb />
			conferred under Article 124(2). It was felt, that consultation with the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India alone, with reference to the appointment of Judges
			<lb />
			to the Supreme Court, was not a very satisfactory mode of appointment,
			<lb />
			because wisdom and experience demanded, that no power should rest in
			<lb />
			a single individual howsoever high and great he may be, and howsoever
			<lb />
			honest and well-meaning. It was suggested, that it would be more
			<lb />
			appropriate if a collegium would make the recommendations to the
			<lb />
			President, with regard to appointments to the higher judiciary, and the
			<lb />
			recommending authority should be more broad based. If the collegium
			<lb />
			was comprised of persons who had knowledge of persons, who may be fit
			<lb />
			for appointment to the Bench, and possessed the qualities required for
			<lb />
			such appointment, it would go a long way towards securing the right
			<lb />
			kind of Judges, who would be truly independent (paragraph 31).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(v)
			<lb />
			It was held, that the appointment of an additional Judge, must be
			<lb />
			made by following the procedure postulated in Article 217(1).
			<lb />
			Accordingly, when the term of an additional Judge expired, and he
			<lb />
			ceased to be a Judge, his reappointment could only be made by once
			<lb />
			again adopting the procedure set out in Article 217(1). The contention,
			<lb />
			that an additional Judge must automatically and without any further
			<lb />
			consideration be appointed as an additional Judge for a further term, or,
			<lb />
			as a permanent Judge, was rejected (paragraphs 38 to 44).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vi) On the question of validity of the letter of the Union Law Minister
			<lb />
			dated 18.3.1981, it was opined, that the same did not violate any legal or
			<lb />
			constitutional provision. It was felt, that the advance consent sought to
			<lb />
			be obtained through the letter dated 18.3.1981, from additional Judges
			<lb />
			or Judges prior to their permanent appointment, would have no
			<lb />
			meaning, so far as the Chief Justice of India was concerned, because
			<lb />
			irrespective of the fact, whether the additional Judge had given his
			<lb />
			consent or not, the Chief Justice of India would have to consider,
			<lb />
			whether it would be in public interest to allow the additional Judge to be
			<lb />
			appointed as a permanent Judge in another High Court (paragraph 54).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vii) After having determined the merits of the individual claim raised by
			<lb />
			S.N. Kumar, J., (who was discontinued by the Central Government, while
			<lb />
			he was holding the position of additional Judge), it was concluded, that it
			<lb />
			would be proper if the Union of India could find a way, to place the letter
			<lb />
			dated 7.5.1981 addressed by the Chief Justice of Delhi High Court to the
			<lb />
			Law Minister, before the Chief Justice of India, and elicit his opinion with
			<lb />
			reference to that letter. And thereupon consider, whether S.N. Kumar,
			<lb />
			J., should be reappointed as additional Judge.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(viii) With reference to K.B.N. Singh, CJ., it was opined that there was a
			<lb />
			clear abdication by the Central Government of its constitutional
			<lb />
			functions, and therefore, his transfer from the Patna High Court to the
			<lb />
			Madras High Court was held as unconstitutional and void.
			<lb />
			A.C. Gupta, J.:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i).
			<lb />
			On the subject of the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, it was opined,
			<lb />
			that the same did not mean freedom of Judges to act arbitrarily. It only
			<lb />
			meant, that Judges must be free, while discharging their judicial
			<lb />
			functions. In order to maintain &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, it was
			<lb />
			felt, that Judges had to be protected against interference, direct or
			<lb />
			indirect. It was concluded, that the constitutional provisions should not
			<lb />
			be construed in a manner, that would tend to undermine the concept of
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; (paragraph 119).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			On the question, whether, on the expiry of the term of office of an
			<lb />
			additional Judge of a High Court, it was permissible to drop him by not
			<lb />
			giving him another term, though the volume of work, pending in the High
			<lb />
			Court, required the services of another Judge? It was opined, that the
			<lb />
			tenure of an additional Judge, was only dependent on the arrears of
			<lb />
			work, or the temporary increase in the business of a High Court. And
			<lb />
			since an additional Judge was not on probation, his performance could
			<lb />
			not be considered to determine, whether he was fit for appointment as a
			<lb />
			permanent Judge. Therefore, it was concluded, that if the volume of
			<lb />
			work pending in the High Court justified the appointment of an
			<lb />
			additional Judge, there could be no reason, why the concerned additional
			<lb />
			Judge should not be appointed for another term. The submission that
			<lb />
			the two years&apos; period mentioned in Article 224, depicted the upper limit of
			<lb />
			the tenure, and that the President was competent to appoint an
			<lb />
			additional Judge, for any shorter period, was rejected. Since the fitness
			<lb />
			of a Judge, had been considered at the time of his initial appointment,
			<lb />
			therefore, while determining whether he should be reappointed, under
			<lb />
			Article 217(1), it was opined, that the scope of inquiry was limited, to
			<lb />
			whether the volume of work pending in the High Court, necessitated his
			<lb />
			continuation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii). Referring to the opinion expressed by the Chief Justice of the High
			<lb />
			Court, in connection with S.N. Kumar, J., it was opined, that when
			<lb />
			allegations were levelled against a Judge with respect to the discharge of
			<lb />
			his duties, the only reasonable course open, which would not undermine
			<lb />
			the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; was, to proceed with an inquiry into
			<lb />
			the allegations and remove the Judge, if the allegations were found to be
			<lb />
			true (in accordance with the procedure laid down under Article 124(4)
			<lb />
			and (5) read with Article 218). It was felt that, dropping an additional
			<lb />
			Judge, at the end of his initial term of office, on the ground that there
			<lb />
			were allegations against him, without properly ascertaining the truth of
			<lb />
			the allegations, was destructive of the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;
			<lb />
			(paragraph 123).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv). With reference to the non-continuation of S.N. Kumar, J., an
			<lb />
			additional Judge of the Delhi High Court, it was observed, that the letter
			<lb />
			of the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court dated 7.5.1981, addressed to
			<lb />
			the Law Minister, was not disclosed to the Chief Justice of India. As the
			<lb />
			relevant material was withheld from the Chief Justice of India, it was
			<lb />
			concluded, that there was no full and effective &quot;consultation&quot;, as
			<lb />
			contemplated by Article 217(1). And therefore, the decision not to extend
			<lb />
			the term of office of S.N. Kumar, J., as additional Judge of the Delhi High
			<lb />
			Court, though the volume of pending work in the High Court required the
			<lb />
			services of an additional Judge, was invalid.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(v). On the question, whether the opinion of the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			would have primacy, in case of a difference of opinion between the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of a High Court and the Chief Justice of India, the view expressed
			<lb />
			was, that the President should accept the opinion of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, unless such opinion suffered from any obvious infirmity. And
			<lb />
			that, the President could not act as an umpire, and choose between the
			<lb />
			two opinions (paragraph 134).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vi). Referring to the judgment in the Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth
			<lb />
			case 5 , wherein it was concluded, that mass transfers were not
			<lb />
			contemplated under Article 222(1), it was opined, that the President
			<lb />
			could transfer a Judge from one High Court to another, only after
			<lb />
			consultation with the Chief Justice of India. And that, the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India must consider in each case, whether the proposed transfer was
			<lb />
			in public interest (paragraph 138).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vii). With reference to the transfer of K.B.N. Singh, CJ., from the Patna
			<lb />
			High Court to the Madras High Court, it was opined, that even if the
			<lb />
			above transfer had been made for administrative reasons, and in public
			<lb />
			interest, it was likely to cause some injury to the transferee, and it would
			<lb />
			only be fair to consider the possibility of transferring him, where he
			<lb />
			would face least difficulties, namely, where the language difficulty would
			<lb />
			not be acute.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			S. Murtaza Fazal Ali, J.:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			On the issue, whether the transfer of a High Court Judge under
			<lb />
			Article 222 required the consent of the Judge proposed to be transferred,
			<lb />
			it was opined, that a non-consensual transfer, would not amount to
			<lb />
			punishment, nor would it involve any stigma. It was accordingly
			<lb />
			concluded, that a transfer made after complying with Article 222, would
			<lb />
			not mar or erode the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; (paragraph 345).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii). With reference to appointing Chief Justices of High Courts from
			<lb />
			outside the State, and for having 1/3rd Judges in every High Court from
			<lb />
			outside the State, it was expressed, that Article 222 conferred an express
			<lb />
			power with the President, to transfer a Judge (which includes, Chief
			<lb />
			Justice) from one State to another. In determining as to how this power
			<lb />
			had to be exercised, it was felt, that the President undoubtedly possessed
			<lb />
			an implied power to lay down the norms, the principles, the conditions
			<lb />
			and the circumstances, under which the said power was to be exercised.
			<lb />
			A declaration by the President regarding the nature and terms of the
			<lb />
			policy (which virtually meant a declaration by the Council of Ministers)
			<lb />
			was quite sufficient, and absolutely legal and constitutional (paragraph
			<lb />
			410).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii). On the subject of validity of the letter of the Union Law Minister
			<lb />
			dated 18.3.1981, it was held, that the same did not in any way tarnish
			<lb />
			the image of Judges, or mar the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;
			<lb />
			(paragraph 433).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv). On the question of appointment of additional Judges, and the
			<lb />
			interpretation of Article 217, the opinion expressed by P.N. Bhagwati and
			<lb />
			E.S. Venkataramiah, JJ. were adopted (paragraph 434).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(v). Insofar as the interpretation of Article 224 was concerned, the
			<lb />
			opinion of P.N. Bhagwati and D.A. Desai, JJ. were accepted, (paragraph
			<lb />
			537). And accordingly, their conclusion about the continuation of S.N.
			<lb />
			Kumar, J., as an additional Judge, after the expiry of his term of
			<lb />
			appointment, was endorsed.
			<lb />
			(vi). On analyzing the decision rendered in the Sankalchand Himatlal
			<lb />
			Sheth case 5 , inter alia, the following necessary concomitants of an
			<lb />
			effective consultation between the President and the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India were drawn. That the consultation, must be full and effective, and
			<lb />
			must precede the actual transfer of the Judge. If consultation with the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India had not taken place, before transferring a Judge, it
			<lb />
			was held, that the transfer would be unconstitutional. All relevant data
			<lb />
			and necessary facts, must be provided to the Chief Justice of India, so
			<lb />
			that, he could arrive at a proper conclusion. Only after the above process
			<lb />
			was fully complied with, the consultation would be considered full and
			<lb />
			effective. It was felt, that the Chief Justice of India owed a duty, both to
			<lb />
			the President and to the Judge proposed to be transferred, to consider
			<lb />
			every relevant fact, before tendering his opinion to the President. Before
			<lb />
			giving his opinion the Chief Justice of India, could informally ascertain
			<lb />
			from the Judge, if there was any personal difficulty, or any humanitarian
			<lb />
			ground, on which his transfer should not be made. And only after having
			<lb />
			done so, the Chief Justice of India, could forward his opinion to the
			<lb />
			President. Applying the above facets of the consultation process, with
			<lb />
			respect to the validity of the order dated 19.1.1981, by which K.B.N.
			<lb />
			Singh, CJ., was transferred, it was held, that the consultation process
			<lb />
			contemplated under Article 222, had been breached, rendering the order
			<lb />
			passed by the President invalid (paragraph 589).
			<lb />
			V.D. Tulzapurkar, J.:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i).
			<lb />
			Insofar as the question of &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; is
			<lb />
			concerned, it was asserted that all the Judges, who had expressed their
			<lb />
			opinions in the matter, had emphasized, that the framers of the
			<lb />
			Constitution had taken the utmost pains, to secure the &quot;independence of
			<lb />
			the Judges&quot; of the higher judiciary. To support the above contention,
			<lb />
			several provisions of the Constitution were referred to. It was also
			<lb />
			pointed out, that the Attorney General representing the Union of India,
			<lb />
			had not dispute the above proposition (paragraph 639).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii). With reference to additional Judges recruited under Article 224(1),
			<lb />
			from the fraternity of practicing Advocates, it was pointed out, that an
			<lb />
			undertaking was taken from them at the time of their initial
			<lb />
			appointment, that if and when a permanent judgeship of that Court was
			<lb />
			offered to them, they would not decline the same. And additionally, the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court would require them to furnish a
			<lb />
			further undertaking, that if they decline to accept such permanent
			<lb />
			judgeship (though offered), or if they resigned from the office of the
			<lb />
			additional judgeship, they would not practice before the Bombay High
			<lb />
			Court, or any court or tribunal subordinate to it. Based on the aforesaid
			<lb />
			undertakings, the contention advanced was, that a legitimate expectancy,
			<lb />
			and an enforceable right to continue in office, came to be conferred on
			<lb />
			the additional Judges recruited from the Bar. It was felt, that it was
			<lb />
			impossible to construe Article 224(1), as conferring upon the appointing
			<lb />
			authority, any absolute power or discretion in the matter of appointment
			<lb />
			of additional Judges to a High Court (paragraphs 622 and 624).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii) All submissions made on behalf of the respondents, that granting
			<lb />
			extension to an additional Judge, or making him a permanent Judge was
			<lb />
			akin to a fresh appointment, were rejected. It was concluded, that
			<lb />
			extension to an additional Judge, or making him permanent, did not
			<lb />
			require re-determination of his suitability under Article 217(1) (paragraph
			<lb />
			628).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv). While dealing with the question of continuation of an additional
			<lb />
			Judge, in situations where there were facts disclosing suspected
			<lb />
			misbehaviour and/or reported lack of integrity, the view expressed was,
			<lb />
			that while considering the question of continuation of a sitting additional
			<lb />
			Judge, on the expiry of his initial term, the test of suitability
			<lb />
			contemplated within the consultative process under Article 217(1) should
			<lb />
			not be evoked -at least till a proper mechanism, having a legal
			<lb />
			sanction, was provided for holding an inquiry, against the Judge
			<lb />
			concerned, with reference to any suspected misbehavior and/or lack of
			<lb />
			integrity (paragraph 628).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(v)
			<lb />
			On the scope of consideration, for continuation as a sitting
			<lb />
			additional Judge (on the expiry of a Judge&apos;s initial term), it was opined,
			<lb />
			that the consultative process should be confined only to see, whether the
			<lb />
			preconditions mentioned in Article 224(1) existed or not, or whether,
			<lb />
			pendency of work justified continuation or not. It was held, that the test
			<lb />
			of suitability contemplated within the consultative process under Article
			<lb />
			217(1), could not and should not, be resorted to (paragraph 629).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vi). On the question of primacy of the Chief Justice of India, with
			<lb />
			reference to Article 217(1), the view expressed was, that the scheme
			<lb />
			envisaged therein, by implication and intent, clearly gave primacy to the
			<lb />
			advice tendered by the Chief Justice of India. It was however sought to
			<lb />
			be clarified, that giving primacy to the advice of the Chief Justice of India,
			<lb />
			in the matter of appointment of Judges of the High Court, should not be
			<lb />
			construed as a power to veto any proposal. And that, if the advice of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India, had proceeded on extraneous or non germane
			<lb />
			considerations, the same would be subject to judicial review, just as the
			<lb />
			President&apos;s final decision, if he were to disregard the advice of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, but for justified and cogent reasons. Interpreting Article
			<lb />
			217(1) in the above manner, it was felt, would go a long way in preserving
			<lb />
			the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; (paragraph 632).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(vii) With regard to the scope of &apos;consultation&apos;, contemplated under
			<lb />
			Article 222(1), the conclusion(s) drawn by the majority view, in the
			<lb />
			Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth case 5 , were endorsed.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(viii). Insofar as, the issue of taking the consent of the concerned Judge,
			<lb />
			prior to his transfer is concerned, based on the decision rendered in the
			<lb />
			Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth case 5 , it was felt, that transfers could be
			<lb />
			made without obtaining the consent of the concerned Judge. And
			<lb />
			accordingly it was held, that non-consensual transfers, were within the
			<lb />
			purview of Article 222(1) (paragraphs 645 and 646).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(ix) With reference to the letter written by the Union Law Minister dated
			<lb />
			18.3.1981, it was asserted, that even a policy transfer, without fixing the
			<lb />
			requisite mechanism or modality of procedure, would not ensure
			<lb />
			complete insulation against executive interference. Conversely it was felt,
			<lb />
			that a selective transfer in an appropriate case, for strictly objective
			<lb />
			reasons, and in public interest, could be non-punitive. It was therefore
			<lb />
			concluded, that each case of transfer, whether based on policy, or for
			<lb />
			individual reasons, would have to be judged on the facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of its own, for deciding, whether it was punitive
			<lb />
			(paragraph 649).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(x)
			<lb />
			It was concluded, that by requiring a sitting additional Judge, to
			<lb />
			give his consent for being appointed to another High Court, virtually
			<lb />
			amounted to seeking his consent for his transfer from his own High
			<lb />
			Court to another High Court, falling within the ambit of Article 222(1).
			<lb />
			Referring to the judgment rendered in the Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth
			<lb />
			case 5 , it was felt, that the circular letter dated 18.3.1981 was an attempt
			<lb />
			to circumvent the safeguards and the stringent conditions expressed in
			<lb />
			the above judgment (paragraph 652). And further, that the circular letter
			<lb />
			clearly exuded an odour of executive dominance and arrogance, intended
			<lb />
			to have coercive effects on the minds of sitting additional Judges, by
			<lb />
			implying a threat to them, that if they did not furnish their consent to be
			<lb />
			shifted elsewhere, they would neither be continued nor made permanent.
			<lb />
			The above letter, was held to be amounting to, executive interference with
			<lb />
			the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, and thus illegal, unconstitutional
			<lb />
			and void. Any consent obtained thereunder, was also held to be void
			<lb />
			(paragraph 654).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(xi) It was also concluded that, the advice of the Chief Justice of India,
			<lb />
			would be robbed of its real efficacy, in the face of such pre-obtained
			<lb />
			consent, and it would have to be regarded as having been issued
			<lb />
			malafide and for a collateral purpose, namely, to bypass Article 222(1)
			<lb />
			and to confront the Chief Justice of India, with a fait accompli, and as
			<lb />
			such, the same was liable to be declared as illegal and unconstitutional
			<lb />
			(paragraph 655).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(xii) The above circular letter dated 18.3.1981, was also held to be
			<lb />
			violative of Article 14, since invidious discrimination was writ large on the
			<lb />
			face of the circular letter. For this additional reason, the letter of the
			<lb />
			Union Law Minister dated 18.3.1981, it was felt, was liable to be struck
			<lb />
			down (paragraphs 659 and 660).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(xiii) On the subject of non-continuation of S.N. Kumar, J., it was held,
			<lb />
			that it was abundantly clear from the correspondence and notings, that
			<lb />
			further details and concrete facts and materials relating to his integrity,
			<lb />
			though specifically asked for by the Chief Justice of India, were not
			<lb />
			furnished, and the letter dated 7.5.1981, which contained such details
			<lb />
			and concrete facts and materials, were kept away from him, leading to
			<lb />
			the inference, that facts which were taken into consideration by the
			<lb />
			Union Law Minister and the Chief Justice of Delhi High Court (which
			<lb />
			provided the basis to the appointing authority, not to extend the
			<lb />
			appointment of S.N. Kumar, J.), were not placed before the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India, and therefore, there was neither full nor effective consultation,
			<lb />
			between the President and the Chief Justice of India, as required by
			<lb />
			Article 217(1). It was accordingly concluded, that the decision against
			<lb />
			S.N. Kumar, J., stood vitiated by legal mala fides, and as such, was liable
			<lb />
			to be held void and non est, and his case had to be sent back to the
			<lb />
			President, for reconsideration and passing appropriate orders, after the
			<lb />
			requisite consultation was undertaken afresh (paragraphs 664 and 666
			<lb />
			to 668).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(xiv) With respect to the validity of the transfer of K.B.N. Singh, CJ., it
			<lb />
			was felt, that in the absence of any connivance or complicity, since no
			<lb />
			unfair play was involved in the procedure followed by the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, it was liable to be concluded, that the impugned transfer had been
			<lb />
			made in public interest, and not by way of punishment. The above
			<lb />
			transfer was accordingly held to be valid (paragraph 680).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			D.A. Desai, J.:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			After noticing, that the President under Article 74, acts on the
			<lb />
			advice of the Council of Ministers, and that, while acting under Article
			<lb />
			217(3), the President performs functions of grave importance. It was felt,
			<lb />
			that it could not be said that while exercising the power of appointment
			<lb />
			of Judges to the higher judiciary, the President was performing either
			<lb />
			judicial or quasi judicial functions. The function of appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges was declared as an executive function, and as such, it was held,
			<lb />
			that Article 74 would come into operation. And therefore concluded, that
			<lb />
			the President would have to act, on the advice of the Council of Ministers,
			<lb />
			in the matter of appointment of Judges under Article 217 (paragraph
			<lb />
			715). And therefore it came to be held, that the ultimate power of
			<lb />
			appointment under Article 217, &quot;unquestionably&quot; rested with the
			<lb />
			President.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			It was pointed out, that before exercising the power of appointment
			<lb />
			of a Judge (other than the Chief Justice of a High Court), the President
			<lb />
			was under a constitutional obligation, to consult the three constitutional
			<lb />
			functionaries, mentioned in Article 217 (paragraphs 718 and 719). And
			<lb />
			that the aforementioned three constitutional functionaries were at par
			<lb />
			with one another. They were coordinate authorities, without any relative
			<lb />
			hierarchy, and as such, the opinion of the Chief Justice of India could
			<lb />
			not be given primacy on the issue of appointment of Judges of High
			<lb />
			Courts (paragraphs 724, 726 and 728).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii) It was also concluded, that on the expiry of the original term of
			<lb />
			appointment of an additional Judge under Article 224, the continuation
			<lb />
			of the concerned Judge, would envisage the re-adoption of the procedure
			<lb />
			contained in Article 217 (paragraphs 736 and 745).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv) It was felt, that there was no gainsaying, that a practice which had
			<lb />
			been followed for over 25 years, namely, that an additional Judge was
			<lb />
			always considered for a fresh tenure, if there was no permanent vacancy,
			<lb />
			and if there was such a vacancy, he was considered for appointment as a
			<lb />
			permanent Judge. It was held, that the contention of the Attorney
			<lb />
			General, that such additional Judge had no priority, preference,
			<lb />
			weightage or right to be considered, and that, he was on par with any
			<lb />
			other person, who could be brought from the market, would amount to
			<lb />
			disregarding the constitutional scheme, and must be rejected (paragraph
			<lb />
			759). It was held, that when a Judge was appointed for a term of two
			<lb />
			years, as an additional Judge, it was sufficient to contemplate, that his
			<lb />
			appointment was not as a permanent Judge. And therefore, if a
			<lb />
			permanent vacancy arose, the additional Judge could not enforce his
			<lb />
			appointment against the permanent vacancy (paragraph 762).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(v)
			<lb />
			It was also concluded, that the term of an additional Judge could
			<lb />
			not be extended for three months or six months, since such short term
			<lb />
			appointments, were wholly inconsistent and contrary to the clear
			<lb />
			intendment of Article 224, and also, unbecoming of the dignity of a High
			<lb />
			Court Judge (paragraphs 763 and 764).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(vi) On the subject of extension of the term of an additional Judge, it
			<lb />
			was felt, that it was not open to the constitutional functionaries, to sit
			<lb />
			tight over a proposal, without expressing their opinion on the merits of
			<lb />
			the proposal, and by sheer inaction, to kill a proposal. It was accordingly
			<lb />
			opined, that when the term of an additional Judge was about to expire, it
			<lb />
			was obligatory on the Chief Justice of the High Court, to initiate the
			<lb />
			proposal for completing the process of consultation, before the period of
			<lb />
			initial appointment expired (paragraph 772).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(vii) With reference to the non-extension of the tenure of S.N. Kumar, J.,
			<lb />
			it was felt, that when two high constitutional functionaries, namely, the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court and the Chief Justice of India, had
			<lb />
			met with a specific reference to his doubtful integrity, the act of not
			<lb />
			showing the letter dated 7.5.1981 to the Chief Justice of India, would not
			<lb />
			detract from the fullness of the consultation, as required by Article 217.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, it was held, that there was a full and effective consultation,
			<lb />
			on all relevant points, including those set out in the letter dated
			<lb />
			7.5.1981. And the claim of the concerned Judge for continuation, was
			<lb />
			liable to be rejected. It was however suggested, that the Government of
			<lb />
			India could even now, show the letter dated 7.5.1981 to the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India, and request him to give his comments. After receiving his
			<lb />
			comments, the Government of India could decide afresh, whether S.N.
			<lb />
			Kumar, J., should be re-appointed as an additional Judge of the Delhi
			<lb />
			High Court. It was however clarified, that the proposed reconsideration,
			<lb />
			should not be treated as a direction, but a mere suggestion.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(viii) On the question, whether the consent of the concerned Judge
			<lb />
			should be obtained prior to his transfer under Article 222(1), it was
			<lb />
			concluded, that the requirement of seeking a prior consent, as a
			<lb />
			prerequisite for exercising the power of transfer under Article 222(1),
			<lb />
			deserved to be rejected (paragraph 813). It was however observed, that
			<lb />
			the above power of transfer under Article 222(1) could not be exercised in
			<lb />
			the absence of public interest, merely on the basis of whim, caprice or
			<lb />
			fancy of the executive, or its desire to bend a Judge to its own way of
			<lb />
			thinking. Three safeguards, namely, full and effective consultation with
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India, the exercise of power only aimed at public
			<lb />
			interest, and judicial review -in case the power was exercised contrary
			<lb />
			to the mandate of law, were suggested to insulate the &quot;independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary&quot;, against an attempt by the executive to control it
			<lb />
			(paragraphs 813 to 815).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ix) It was also concluded, that the transfer of an individual Judge, for
			<lb />
			something improper in his behavior, or conduct, would certainly cast a
			<lb />
			slur or attach a stigma, and would leave an indelible mark on his
			<lb />
			character. Even the High Court to which he was transferred would shun
			<lb />
			him, and the consumers of justice would have little or no faith in his
			<lb />
			judicial integrity. Accordingly it was concluded, that a transfer on
			<lb />
			account of any complaint or grievance against a Judge, referable to his
			<lb />
			conduct or behaviour, was impermissible under Article 222(1).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(x)
			<lb />
			On the question of transfer of K.B.N. Singh, CJ., it was felt, that his
			<lb />
			order of transfer was vitiated for want of effective consultation, and his
			<lb />
			selective transfer would cast a slur or stigma on him. It was felt, that the
			<lb />
			transfer did not appear to be in public interest. The order of transfer
			<lb />
			dated 20.12.1980 was accordingly, considered to be vitiated, and as
			<lb />
			such, was declared void.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			R.S. Pathak, J. (as he then was):
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			With reference to the issue of &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, it
			<lb />
			was observed, that while the administration of justice drew its legal
			<lb />
			sanction from the Constitution, its credibility rested in the faith of the
			<lb />
			people. Indispensable to such faith, was the &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot;. An independent and impartial judiciary, it was felt, gives
			<lb />
			character and content to the constitutional milieu (paragraph 874).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			On the subject of appointment of Judges to High Courts, it was
			<lb />
			essential for the President, to consult the Governor of the State, the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India and the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court. It was
			<lb />
			pointed out, that three distinct constitutional functionaries were involved
			<lb />
			in the consultative process, and each had a distinct role to play
			<lb />
			(paragraph 887). In a case where the Chief Justice of the High Court and
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India, were agreed on a recommendation, it was
			<lb />
			within reason to hold, that the President would ordinarily accept the
			<lb />
			recommendation, unless there were strong and cogent reasons, for not
			<lb />
			doing so (paragraph 889). It was however pointed out, that the President
			<lb />
			was not always obliged to agree, with a recommendation, wherein the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of the High Court and the Chief Justice of India, had
			<lb />
			concurred. In this behalf, it was observed, that even though, during the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly debates, a proposal was made, that the
			<lb />
			appointment of a Judge should require the &quot;concurrence&quot; of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, and the above proposal was endorsed by the Law
			<lb />
			Commission of India, yet the proposal had fallen through, and as such,
			<lb />
			the Constitution as it presently exists, contemplated &quot;consultation&quot; and
			<lb />
			not &quot;concurrence&quot; (paragraph 890).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii) On the question, as to whether the Chief Justice of India had
			<lb />
			primacy, over the recommendation made by the Chief Justice of the High
			<lb />
			Court, it was felt, that the Chief Justice of India did not sit in appellate
			<lb />
			judgment, over the advice tendered by the Chief Justice of the High
			<lb />
			Court. It was pointed out, that the advice tendered by the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India, emerged after taking into account, not only the primary material
			<lb />
			before him, but also, the assessment made by the Chief Justice of the
			<lb />
			High Court. And therefore, when he rendered his advice, the assessment
			<lb />
			of the Chief Justice of the High Court, must be deemed to have been
			<lb />
			considered by him. It was pointed out, that from the constitutional
			<lb />
			scheme, it appeared, that in matters concerning the High Courts, there
			<lb />
			was a close consultative relationship, between the President and the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India. In that capacity, the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			functioned, as a constitutional check, on the exercise of arbitrary power,
			<lb />
			and was the protector of the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; (paragraph
			<lb />
			891).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv) On the subject of appointment of Judges to the High Courts, it was
			<lb />
			concluded, that the appointment of an additional Judge, like the
			<lb />
			appointment of a permanent Judge, must be made in the manner
			<lb />
			prescribed in Article 217(1). Accordingly, it was felt, that there was no
			<lb />
			reason to suspect, that a person found fit for appointment as an
			<lb />
			additional Judge, and had already gained proficiency and experience,
			<lb />
			would not be appointed as a Judge for a further period, in order that the
			<lb />
			work may be disposed of (paragraph 893).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(v)
			<lb />
			It was also opined, that the judiciary by judicial verdict, could not
			<lb />
			decide, how many permanent Judges were required for a High Court.
			<lb />
			And if a Court was not competent to do that, it could not issue a
			<lb />
			direction to the Government, that additional Judges should be appointed
			<lb />
			as permanent Judges (paragraph 895). Accordingly it was felt, that there
			<lb />
			was no doubt whatever, that the provision of Article 217(1) would come
			<lb />
			into play, when an additional Judge was to be considered for further
			<lb />
			appointment as an additional Judge, or was to be considered for
			<lb />
			appointment as a permanent Judge (paragraph 897).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vi) With reference to the non-continuation of S.N. Kumar, J., it was
			<lb />
			pointed out, that the allegations contained in the letter dated 7.5.1981
			<lb />
			strongly influenced the decision of the Government. Since the aforesaid
			<lb />
			letter was not brought to the notice of the Chief Justice of India, it was
			<lb />
			inevitable to conclude, that the process of consultation with the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India was not full and effective, and the withholding of
			<lb />
			important and relevant material from the Chief Justice of India, vitiated
			<lb />
			the process. It was accordingly held, that the non-continuation of the
			<lb />
			term of S.N. Kumar, J., was in violation of the mandatory constitutional
			<lb />
			requirements contained in Article 217(1). It was felt, that the issue
			<lb />
			pertaining to the continuation of S.N. Kumar, J., needed to be
			<lb />
			reconsidered, and a decision needed to be taken, only after full and
			<lb />
			effective consultation (paragraph 904).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vii) On the issue of transfer of Judges under Article 222(1), it was
			<lb />
			concluded, that the consent of the concerned Judge was not one of the
			<lb />
			mandated requirements (paragraph 913). It was pointed out, that the
			<lb />
			transfer of a Judge, could be made only in public interest, and that no
			<lb />
			Judge could be transferred, on the ground of misbehaviour or incapacity.
			<lb />
			The question of invoking Article 222(1), for purposes of punishing a
			<lb />
			Judge, was clearly ruled out (paragraphs 917 and 918). It was clarified,
			<lb />
			that the Judge proposed to be transferred, did not have a right of
			<lb />
			hearing. And that, the scope and degree of inquiry by the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India, fell within his exclusive discretion. All that was necessary was,
			<lb />
			that the Judge should know why his transfer was proposed, so that he
			<lb />
			would be able to acquaint the Chief Justice of India, why he should not
			<lb />
			be so transferred. It was further clarified, that the process of consultation
			<lb />
			envisaged under Article 222(1) required, that all the material in
			<lb />
			possession of the President must be placed before the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India (paragraph 919).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(viii) It was held that, it was open to the Judge, who was subjected to
			<lb />
			transfer, to seek judicial review, by contesting his transfer on the ground
			<lb />
			that it violated Article 222(1) (paragraph 920).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ix) It was also felt, that the power to transfer a Judge from one High
			<lb />
			Court to another, could constitute a threat, to the sense of independence
			<lb />
			and impartiality of the Judge, and accordingly, it was held, that the said
			<lb />
			power should be exercised sparingly, and only for very strong reasons
			<lb />
			(paragraph 921).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(x)
			<lb />
			On the validity of the transfer of K.B.N. Singh, CJ., it was
			<lb />
			concluded, that the considerations on which the transfer had been made,
			<lb />
			could be regarded as falling within the expression &quot;public interest&quot;, and
			<lb />
			therefore, the order of transfer did not violate Article 222(1).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(xi) Insofar as the validity of the letter of the Union Law Minister dated
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			18.3.1981 is concerned, it was observed, that neither the proposal nor
			<lb />
			the consent given thereto, had any legal status. In the above view, it was
			<lb />
			held, that the circular letter could not be acted upon, and any consent
			<lb />
			given pursuant thereto, was not binding.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			E.S. Venkataramiah, J. (as he then was):
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			With reference to the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, it was opined,
			<lb />
			that the same was one of the central values on which the Constitution
			<lb />
			was based. It was pointed out, that in all countries, where the rule of law
			<lb />
			prevailed, and the power to adjudicate upon disputes between a man and
			<lb />
			a man, and a man and the State, and a State and another State, and a
			<lb />
			State and the Centre, was entrusted to a judicial body, it was natural
			<lb />
			that such body should be assigned a status, free from capricious or
			<lb />
			whimsical interference from outside, so that it could act, without fear and
			<lb />
			in consonance with judicial conscience (paragraph 1068).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			Referring to Article 217(1) it was asserted, that each of the three
			<lb />
			functionaries mentioned therein, had to be consulted before a Judge of a
			<lb />
			High Court could be appointed. It was pointed out, that each of the
			<lb />
			consultees, had a distinct and separate role to play. Given the distinct
			<lb />
			roles assigned to them, which may to some extent be overlapping, it
			<lb />
			could not be said, that the Chief Justice of India occupied a position of
			<lb />
			primacy, amongst the three consultees (paragraph 1019).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii) The power of appointment of a Judge of a High Court was
			<lb />
			considered to be an executive power (paragraph 1023). Accordingly,
			<lb />
			while making an appointment of a High Court Judge, the President was
			<lb />
			bound to act, on the advice of his Council of Ministers, and at the same
			<lb />
			time, giving due regard to the opinions expressed by those who were
			<lb />
			required to be consulted under Article 217(1). Despite the above, it was
			<lb />
			felt, that there was no scope for holding, that either the Council of
			<lb />
			Ministers could not advise the President, or the opinion of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India was binding on the President. Although, it was felt, that
			<lb />
			such opinion should be given due respect and regard (paragraph 1032).
			<lb />
			It was held, that the above method was intrinsic in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges, as in that way, Judges may be called people&apos;s
			<lb />
			Judges. If the appointments of Judges were to be made on the basis of
			<lb />
			the recommendations of Judges only, then they will be Judges&apos; Judges,
			<lb />
			and such appointments may not fit into the scheme of popular
			<lb />
			democracy (paragraph 1042).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv) It was held, that the Constitution did not prescribe different modes
			<lb />
			of appointment for permanent Judges, additional Judges, or acting
			<lb />
			Judges. All of them were required to be appointed by the same process,
			<lb />
			namely, in the manner contemplated under Article 217(1) (paragraph
			<lb />
			1061). The appointment of almost all High Court Judges initially as
			<lb />
			additional Judges under Article 224(1), and later on as permanent
			<lb />
			Judges under Article 217(1), was not conducive to the independence of
			<lb />
			judiciary (paragraph 1067). It was held, that the Constitution did not
			<lb />
			confer any right upon an additional Judge, to claim as of right, that he
			<lb />
			should be appointed again, either as a permanent Judge, or as an
			<lb />
			additional Judge. Accordingly, it was held, that there was no such
			<lb />
			enforceable right (paragraph 1074).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(v)
			<lb />
			Despite the above, it was observed, that in the absence of cogent
			<lb />
			reasons for not appointing an additional Judge, the appointment of
			<lb />
			somebody else in his place, would be an unreasonable and a perverse
			<lb />
			act, which would entitle the additional Judge, to move a Court for
			<lb />
			appropriate relief, in the peculiar circumstances (paragraph 1086). It
			<lb />
			was held, that having regard to the high office, to which the appointment
			<lb />
			was made, and the association of high dignitaries, who had to be
			<lb />
			consulted before any such appointment was made, the application of
			<lb />
			principles of natural justice, as of right, was ruled out (paragraph 1087).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vi) With reference to Article 222, it was opined, that the consent of the
			<lb />
			Judge being transferred, was not a prerequisite before passing an order
			<lb />
			of transfer (paragraphs 1097 and 1099). It was held, that the transfer of
			<lb />
			a Judge of a High Court to another High Court, could not be construed
			<lb />
			as a fresh appointment, in the High Court to which the Judge was
			<lb />
			transferred. An order of transfer made under Article 222, it was held,
			<lb />
			was liable to be struck down by a Court, if it could be shown, that it had
			<lb />
			been made for an extraneous reason, i.e., on a ground falling outside the
			<lb />
			scope of Article 222. Under Article 222, a Judge could be transferred,
			<lb />
			when the transfer served public interest. It was held, that the President
			<lb />
			had no power to transfer a High Court Judge, for reasons not bearing on
			<lb />
			public interest, or arising out of whim, caprice or fancy of the executive,
			<lb />
			or because of the executive desire to bend a Judge to its own way of
			<lb />
			thinking (paragraphs 1097, 1099 and 1132).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vii) It was held, that Article 222 cannot be resorted to on the ground of
			<lb />
			alleged misbehaviour or incapacity of a Judge (paragraph 1139).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(viii) Based on the opinion expressed by several expert bodies, it was
			<lb />
			opined, that any transfer of a Judge of a High Court under Article 222, in
			<lb />
			order to implement the policy of appointing Chief Justice of every High
			<lb />
			Court from outside the concerned State, and of having at least 1/3rd of
			<lb />
			Judges of every High Court from outside the State, would not be
			<lb />
			unconstitutional (paragraph 1164).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(ix) The letter of the Union Minister of Law dated 18.3.1981, was found
			<lb />
			to be valid. All contentions raised against the validity thereof were
			<lb />
			rejected (paragraph 1239).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(x)
			<lb />
			The decision of the President not to issue a fresh order of
			<lb />
			appointment to S.N. Kumar, J., on the expiry of his term as an additional
			<lb />
			Judge of the Delhi High Court, was held to be justified (paragraph 1128).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(xi) The transfer of K.B.N. Singh, CJ., was held to have been made
			<lb />
			strictly in consonance with the procedure indicated in the Sankalchand
			<lb />
			Himatlal Sheth case 5 . It was accordingly concluded, that there was no
			<lb />
			ground to hold, that the above transfer was not considered by the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, in a fair and reasonable way. On the facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of the case, it was concluded that it was not possible to
			<lb />
			hold that the above transfer was either illegal or void (paragraphs 1252
			<lb />
			and 1257).

		<head>
			The Second Judges Case -(1993) 4 SCC 441:
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			17. For the purpose of adjudication of the present issue, namely,
			<lb />
			whether the judgment rendered by this Court in the Second Judges case
			<lb />
			needs to be re-examined, it is not necessary to delineate the views
			<lb />
			expressed by the individual Judges, as the conclusions drawn by them
			<lb />
			are per se not subject matter of challenge. The limited challenge being,
			<lb />
			that vital aspects of the matter, which needed to have been considered
			<lb />
			were not canvassed, and therefore, could not be taken into consideration
			<lb />
			in the process of decision making. In the above perspective, we consider
			<lb />
			it just and proper to extract hereunder, only the conclusions drawn by
			<lb />
			the majority view:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;(1) The process of appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court and the
			<lb />
			High Courts is an integrated &apos;participatory consultative process&apos; for
			<lb />
			selecting the best and most suitable persons available for appointment;
			<lb />
			and all the constitutional functionaries must perform this duty
			<lb />
			collectively with a view primarily to reach an agreed decision, subserving
			<lb />
			the constitutional purpose, so that the occasion of primacy does not
			<lb />
			arise.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2) Initiation of the proposal for appointment in the case of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court must be by the Chief Justice of India, and in the case of a High
			<lb />
			Court by the Chief Justice of that High Court; and for transfer of a
			<lb />
			Judge/Chief Justice of a High Court, the proposal has to be initiated by
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India. This is the manner in which proposals for
			<lb />
			appointments to the Supreme Court and the High Courts as well as for
			<lb />
			the transfers of Judges/Chief Justices of the High Courts must invariably
			<lb />
			be made.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(3) In the event of conflicting opinions by the constitutional functionaries,
			<lb />
			the opinion of the judiciary &apos;symbolised by the view of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India&apos;, and formed in the manner indicated, has primacy.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(4) No appointment of any Judge to the Supreme Court or any High Court
			<lb />
			can be made, unless it is in conformity with the opinion of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(5) In exceptional cases alone, for stated strong cogent reasons, disclosed
			<lb />
			to the Chief Justice of India, indicating that the recommendee is not
			<lb />
			suitable for appointment, that appointment recommended by the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India may not be made. However, if the stated reasons are not
			<lb />
			accepted by the Chief Justice of India and the other Judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court who have been consulted in the matter, on reiteration of
			<lb />
			the recommendation by the Chief Justice of India, the appointment
			<lb />
			should be made as a healthy convention.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(6) Appointment to the office of the Chief Justice of India should be of the
			<lb />
			seniormost Judge of the Supreme Court considered fit to hold the office.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(7) The opinion of the Chief Justice of India has not mere primacy, but is
			<lb />
			determinative in the matter of transfers of High Court judges/Chief
			<lb />
			Justices.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(8) Consent of the transferred Judge/Chief Justice is not required for
			<lb />
			either the first of any subsequent transfer from one High Court to
			<lb />
			another.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(9) Any transfer made on the recommendation of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India is not to be deemed to be punitive, and such transfer is not
			<lb />
			justiciable on any ground.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(
		</p>
		<p>
			10) In making all appointments and transfers, the norms indicated must
			<lb />
			be followed. However, the same do not confer any justiciable right in any
			<lb />
			one.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(11) Only limited judicial review on the grounds specified earlier is
			<lb />
			available in matters of appointments and transfers.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(12) The initial appointment of Judge can be made to a High Court other
			<lb />
			than that for which the proposal was initiated.
			<lb />
			(13) Fixation of Judge-strength in the High Courts is justiciable, but only
			<lb />
			to the extent and in the manner indicated.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(14) The majority opinion in S.P. Gupta v. Union of India (1982) 2 SCR
			<lb />
			365: AIR 1982 SC 149, in so far as it takes the contrary view relating to
			<lb />
			primacy of the role of the Chief Justice of India in matters of
			<lb />
			appointments and transfers, and the justiciability of these matters as
			<lb />
			well as in relation to Judge-strength, does not commend itself to us as
			<lb />
			being the correct view. The relevant provisions of the Constitution,
			<lb />
			including the constitutional scheme must now be construed, understood
			<lb />
			and implemented in the manner indicated herein by us.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The Third Judges case -(1998) 7 SCC 739:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			18. For exactly the same reasons as have been noticed with reference to
			<lb />
			the Second Judges case, it is not necessary to dwell into the unanimous
			<lb />
			view expressed in the Third Judges case. The concession of the Attorney
			<lb />
			General for India, as was expressly recorded in paragraph 11 of the Third
			<lb />
			Judges case, needs to be extracted to highlight the fact, that the then
			<lb />
			Attorney General had conceded, that the opinion recorded by the
			<lb />
			majority in the Second Judges case, had been accepted by the Union of
			<lb />
			India and, as such, would be binding on it. Paragraph 11 is accordingly
			<lb />
			reproduced hereunder:
			<lb />
			&quot;11. We record at the outset the statements of the Attorney General that
			<lb />
			(1) the Union of India is not seeking a review or reconsideration of the
			<lb />
			judgment in the Second Judges case (1993) 4 SCC 441 and that (2) the
			<lb />
			Union of India shall accept and treat as binding the answers of this Court
			<lb />
			to the questions set out in the Reference.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19. It is likewise necessary to extract herein, only the final summary of
			<lb />
			conclusions expressed in the Third Judges case, which are placed below:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;1. The expression &quot;consultation with the Chief justice of India&quot; in
			<lb />
			Articles 217(1) of the Constitution of India requires consultation with a
			<lb />
			plurality of Judges in the formation of the opinion of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India. The sole, individual opinion of the Chief Justice of Indian does not
			<lb />
			constitute &quot;consultation&quot; within the meaning of the said Articles.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			2.
			<lb />
			The transfer of puisne Judges is judicially reviewable only to this
			<lb />
			extent: that the recommendation that has been made by the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India in this behalf has not been made in consultation with the
			<lb />
			four seniormost puisne Judges of the Supreme Court and/or that the
			<lb />
			views of the Chief Justice of the High Court from which the transfer is to
			<lb />
			be effected and of the Chief Justice of the High Court to which the
			<lb />
			transfer is to be effected have not been obtained.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			3.
			<lb />
			The Chief Justice of India must make a recommendation to appoint
			<lb />
			a Judge of the Supreme Court and to transfer a Chief Justice or puisne
			<lb />
			Judge of a High Court in consultation with the four seniormost puisne
			<lb />
			Judges of the Supreme Court. Insofar as an appointment to the High
			<lb />
			Court is concerned, the recommendation must be made in consultation
			<lb />
			with two seniormost puisne Judges of the Supreme Court.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			4.
			<lb />
			The Chief Justice of India is not entitled to act solely in his
			<lb />
			individual capacity, without consultation with other Judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court, in respect of materials and information conveyed by the
			<lb />
			Government of India for non-appointment of a judge recommended for
			<lb />
			appointment.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			5.
			<lb />
			The requirement of consultation by the Chief Justice of India with
			<lb />
			his colleagues who are likely to be conversant with the affairs of the
			<lb />
			concerned High Court does not refer only to those Judges who have that
			<lb />
			High Court as a parent High Court. It does not exclude Judges who have
			<lb />
			occupied the office of a Judge or Chief Justice of that High Court on
			<lb />
			transfer.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			6.
			<lb />
			&quot;Strong cogent reasons&quot; do not have to be recorded as justification
			<lb />
			for a departure from the order of seniority, in respect of each senior
			<lb />
			Judge who has been passed over. What has to be recorded is the positive
			<lb />
			reason for the recommendation.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			The views of the Judges consulted should be in writing and should
			<lb />
			be conveyed to the Government of India by the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			along with his views to the extent set out in the body of this opinion.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			The Chief Justice of India is obliged to comply with the norms and
			<lb />
			the requirement of the consultation process, as aforestated, in making
			<lb />
			his recommendations to the Government of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			Recommendations made by the Chief Justice of India without
			<lb />
			complying with the norms and requirements of the consultation process,
			<lb />
			as aforestated, are not binding upon the Government of India.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			III. MOTION BY THE RESPONDENTS, FOR THE REVIEW OF THE
			<lb />
			SECOND AND THIRD JUDGES CASES:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			20. It was the contention of the learned Attorney General, that in the
			<lb />
			submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel representing
			<lb />
			the petitioners, for adjudication of the merits of the controversy,
			<lb />
			emphatic reliance had been placed on the judgments rendered by this
			<lb />
			Court in the Second and Third Judges cases. It was the contention of the
			<lb />
			learned Attorney General, that the conclusions drawn in the above
			<lb />
			judgments, needed a reconsideration by way of a fresh scrutiny, to
			<lb />
			determine, whether the conclusions recorded therein, could withstand
			<lb />
			the original provisions of the Constitution, viewed in the background of
			<lb />
			the debates in the Constituent Assembly.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			21. In order to record the facts truthfully, it was emphasized, that the
			<lb />
			submissions advanced by him, could not be canvassed on behalf of the
			<lb />
			Union of India as in the Third Judges case, the Union had consciously
			<lb />
			accepted as binding the judgment rendered in the Second Judges case.
			<lb />
			Despite the above, the Attorney General was emphatic, that the Union of
			<lb />
			India could not be debarred from seeking reconsideration of the judgment
			<lb />
			rendered by this Court in the Second Judges case. In order to dissuade
			<lb />
			the learned Attorney General from the course he insisted to pursue, it
			<lb />
			was suggested, that the determination by this Court in the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case would not prejudice the claim of the Union of India, if the
			<lb />
			Union could establish, that the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution,
			<lb />
			namely, the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; would not stand
			<lb />
			compromised by the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act. Despite the
			<lb />
			instant suggestion, the Attorney General pleaded, that he be allowed to
			<lb />
			establish, that the determination rendered by the nine-Judge Bench in
			<lb />
			the Second Judges case, was not sustainable in law. At his insistence,
			<lb />
			we allowed him to advance his submissions. Needless to mention, that if
			<lb />
			the Attorney General was successful in persuading us, that the said
			<lb />
			judgment did not prima facie lay down the correct legal/constitutional
			<lb />
			position, the matter would have to be examined by a Constitution Bench,
			<lb />
			with a strength of nine or more Judges of this Court, only if, we would
			<lb />
			additionally uphold the challenge to the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment, and strike down the same, failing which the new regime
			<lb />
			would replace the erstwhile system.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			22. First and foremost, our attention was drawn to Article 124 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, as it existed, prior to the present amendment. It was
			<lb />
			submitted that Article 124 contemplated, that the Supreme Court would
			<lb />
			comprise of the Chief Justice of India, and not more than seven other
			<lb />
			Judges (unless, the Parliament by law, prescribed a larger number). It
			<lb />
			was submitted, that clause (2) of Article 124 vested the power of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court, with the President. The
			<lb />
			proviso under Article 124(2) postulated a mandatory &quot;consultation&quot; with
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India. Appointments contemplated under Article
			<lb />
			124, also required a non-mandatory &quot;consultation&quot; with such other
			<lb />
			Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts, as the President may
			<lb />
			deem necessary. It was accordingly submitted, that the consultation
			<lb />
			contemplated under Article 124(2), at the hands of the President was
			<lb />
			wide enough to include, not only the collegium of Judges, in terms of the
			<lb />
			judgment rendered by this Court in the Second Judges case, but each
			<lb />
			and every single Judge on the strength of the Supreme Court, and also
			<lb />
			the Judges of the High Courts of the States, as the President may choose
			<lb />
			to consult. It was submitted, that only a limited role assigned to the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India, had been altered by the judgment in the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case, into an all pervasive decision taken by the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, in consultation with a collegium of Judges. It was pointed out, that
			<lb />
			the term &quot;consultation&quot; expressed in Article 124 with reference to the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India, had been interpreted to mean &quot;concurrence&quot;. And
			<lb />
			accordingly, the President has been held to be bound, by the
			<lb />
			recommendation made to him, by the Chief Justice of India and his
			<lb />
			collegium of Judges. It was contended, that the above determination,
			<lb />
			was wholly extraneous to the plain reading of the language engaged in
			<lb />
			Article 124 (in its original format). It was asserted, that there was never
			<lb />
			any question of &quot;concurrence&quot;, as Article 124 merely contemplated
			<lb />
			&quot;consultation&quot;. It was contended, that the above &quot;consultation&quot; had been
			<lb />
			made mandatory and binding, on the President even in a situation where,
			<lb />
			the opinion expressed by the Chief Justice and the collegium of Judges,
			<lb />
			was not acceptable to the President. It was asserted, that it was not
			<lb />
			understandable, how this addition came to be made to the plain and
			<lb />
			simple language engaged in framing Article 124. It was submitted, that
			<lb />
			once primacy is given to the Chief Justice of India (i.e., to the collegium of
			<lb />
			Judges, contemplated under the Second and Third Judges cases), then
			<lb />
			there was an implied exclusion of &quot;consultation&quot;, with the other Judges
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court, and also, with the Judges of the High Courts, even
			<lb />
			though, there was an express provision, empowering the President to
			<lb />
			make up his mind, after consulting the other Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court and the Judges of the High Courts, as he may choose.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			23. The Attorney General further contended, that the interpretation
			<lb />
			placed on Article 124 in the Second Judges case, was an absolutely
			<lb />
			unsustainable interpretation, specially when examined, with reference to
			<lb />
			the following illustration. That even if all the Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court, recommend a name, to which the Chief Justice of India alone, was
			<lb />
			not agreeable, the said recommendee could not be appointed as a Judge.
			<lb />
			This illustration, it was submitted, placed absolute power in the hands of
			<lb />
			one person -the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			24. The learned Attorney General, then invited the Court&apos;s attention to
			<lb />
			Article 125, so as to contend, that the salary payable to the Judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court has to be determined by the Parliament by law, and until
			<lb />
			such determination was made, the emoluments payable to a Judge would
			<lb />
			be such, as were specified in the Second Schedule. It was submitted,
			<lb />
			that the Parliament was given an express role to determine even the
			<lb />
			salary of Judges, which is a condition of service of the Judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court. He also pointed to Article 126, which contemplates, the
			<lb />
			appointment of one of the Judges of the Supreme Court, to discharge the
			<lb />
			functions of Chief Justice of India, on account of his absence or
			<lb />
			otherwise, or when the Chief Justice of India, was unable to perform the
			<lb />
			duties of his office. The Court&apos;s attention was also drawn to Article 127,
			<lb />
			to point out, that in a situation where the available Judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court, could not satisfy the quorum of the Bench, required to
			<lb />
			adjudicate upon a controversy, the Chief Justice of India could continue
			<lb />
			the proceedings of the case, by including therein, a Judge of a High Court
			<lb />
			(who was qualified for appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court), in
			<lb />
			order to make up the quorum, with the previous consent of the President
			<lb />
			of India. It was submitted, that the role of the President of India was
			<lb />
			manifestly inter-twined with administration of justice, by allowing the
			<lb />
			President to appoint a Judge of the High Court, as a Judge of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court on &apos;ad hoc&apos; basis. Reference was then made to Article
			<lb />
			128, whereby the Chief Justice of India, with the previous approval of the
			<lb />
			President, could require a retired Judge of the Supreme Court, or a
			<lb />
			person who has held office as a Judge of a High Court, and was duly
			<lb />
			qualified for appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court, to sit and act
			<lb />
			as a Judge of the Supreme Court. It was pointed out, that this was yet
			<lb />
			another instance, where the President&apos;s noticeable role in the functioning
			<lb />
			of the higher judiciary, was contemplated by the Constitution itself. The
			<lb />
			Court&apos;s attention was then drawn to Article 130, whereunder, even
			<lb />
			though the seat of the Supreme Court was to be at Delhi, it could be
			<lb />
			moved to any other place in India, if so desired by the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, with the approval of the President. Yet again, depicting the active
			<lb />
			role assigned to the President, in the functioning of the higher judiciary.
			<lb />
			Likewise, the Court&apos;s attention was invited to Articles 133 and 134,
			<lb />
			providing for an appellate remedy in civil and criminal matters
			<lb />
			respectively, to the Supreme Court, leaving it open to the Parliament to
			<lb />
			vary the scope of the Courts&apos; appellate jurisdiction. Insofar as Article 137
			<lb />
			is concerned, it was pointed out, that the power of review of the
			<lb />
			judgments or orders passed by the Supreme Court, was subject to the
			<lb />
			provisions of any law made by the Parliament, or any rules that may be
			<lb />
			made under Article 145. With reference to Article 138, it was contended,
			<lb />
			that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, could be extended to matters
			<lb />
			falling in the Union List, as the Parliament may choose to confer. Similar
			<lb />
			reference was made to clause (2) of Article 138, wherein further
			<lb />
			jurisdiction could be entrusted to the Supreme Court, when agreed to, by
			<lb />
			the Government of India and by any State Government, if the Parliament
			<lb />
			by law so provides. Based on the above, it was contended, that Article
			<lb />
			138 was yet another provision, which indicated a participatory role of the
			<lb />
			Parliament, in the activities of the Supreme Court. Likewise, this Court&apos;s
			<lb />
			attention was drawn to Article 139, whereby the Parliament could confer,
			<lb />
			by law, the power to issue directions, orders or writs, in addition to the
			<lb />
			framework demarcated through Article 32(2). This, according to the
			<lb />
			learned Attorney General, indicated another participatory role of the
			<lb />
			Parliament in the activities of the Supreme Court. Pointing to Article
			<lb />
			140, it was submitted, that the Parliament could by law confer upon the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court supplemental powers, in addition to the powers vested
			<lb />
			with it by the Constitution, as may appear to the Parliament to be
			<lb />
			necessary or desirable, to enable the Supreme Court to exercise its
			<lb />
			jurisdiction more effectively. It was submitted, that one Article after the
			<lb />
			other, including Article 140, indicated a collective and participatory role
			<lb />
			of the President and the Parliament, in the activities of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court. Having read out Article 142(2), it was asserted, that even on the
			<lb />
			subject of securing the attendance of any person, and the discovery or
			<lb />
			production of any documents, or the investigation or punishment of any
			<lb />
			contempt of itself, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was subject to
			<lb />
			the law made by the Parliament. The learned Attorney General, also
			<lb />
			referred to Article 145, whereunder, it was open to the Parliament to
			<lb />
			enact law framed by the Parliament, for regulating generally the practice
			<lb />
			and procedure of the Supreme Court. In the absence of any such law,
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court had the liberty to make rules for regulating the
			<lb />
			practice and procedure of the Court, with the approval of the President.
			<lb />
			It was submitted, that even on elementary issues like procedure, the
			<lb />
			Parliament and/or the President were assigned a role by the
			<lb />
			Constitution, in activities strictly in the judicial domain. With reference
			<lb />
			to the activities of the Supreme Court, the Court&apos;s attention was also
			<lb />
			drawn to Article 146, which envisages that appointments of officers and
			<lb />
			servants of the Supreme Court, were to be made by the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India. It was pointed out, that the authority conferred under Article 146,
			<lb />
			was subservient to the right of the President, to frame rules requiring
			<lb />
			future appointments to any office connected to the Supreme Court, to be
			<lb />
			made, only in consultation with the Union Pubic Service Commission.
			<lb />
			The aforesaid right of appointing officers and servants to the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court, is also clearly subservient to the right of the Parliament, to make
			<lb />
			provisions by enacting law on the above subject. In the absence of a
			<lb />
			legislation, at the hands of the Parliament, the conditions of service of
			<lb />
			officers and servants of the Supreme Court would be such, as may be
			<lb />
			prescribed by rules framed, by the Chief Justice of India. The rules
			<lb />
			framed by the Chief Justice, are subject to the approval by the President,
			<lb />
			with reference to salaries, allowances, leave and pension.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			25. With reference to the appointments made to the High Courts, the
			<lb />
			Court&apos;s attention was invited to Article 217, whereunder, the authority of
			<lb />
			appointing a Judge to a High Court was vested with the President. The
			<lb />
			President alone, was authorized to make such appointments, after
			<lb />
			&quot;consultation&quot; with the Chief Justice of India, the Governor of the State,
			<lb />
			and the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court. The Court&apos;s attention
			<lb />
			was also drawn to Article 221, whereunder, the power to determine the
			<lb />
			salary payable to a Judge, was to be determined by law to be enacted by
			<lb />
			the Parliament. Till any such law was framed by the Parliament, High
			<lb />
			Court Judges would be entitled to such salaries, as were specified in the
			<lb />
			Second Schedule. The allowances payable to Judges of the High Court,
			<lb />
			as also, the right in respect of leave of absence and pension, were also left
			<lb />
			to the wisdom of Parliament, to be determined by law. And until such
			<lb />
			determination, Judges of the High Courts were entitled to allowances and
			<lb />
			rights, as were indicated in the Second Schedule. The Court&apos;s attention
			<lb />
			was also drawn to Article 222, wherein, the President was authorized,
			<lb />
			after &quot;consulting&quot; the Chief Justice of India, to transfer a Judge from one
			<lb />
			High Court to another. Inviting the Court&apos;s attention to the provisions
			<lb />
			referred to in the foregoing two paragraphs contained in Part V, Chapter
			<lb />
			IV -The Union Judiciary, and Part VI, Chapter V -The High Courts in
			<lb />
			the States, it was asserted, that the role of the President, and also, that of
			<lb />
			the Parliament was thoughtfully interwoven in various salient aspects,
			<lb />
			pertaining to the higher judiciary. Exclusion of the executive and the
			<lb />
			legislature, in the manner expressed through the Second Judges case, in
			<lb />
			the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, as also,
			<lb />
			transfer of Judges and Chief Justices of one High Court to another, was
			<lb />
			clearly against the spirit of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			26. It was submitted, that the method of appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, was not the &quot;be all&quot; or the &quot;end all&quot;, of the independence
			<lb />
			of the judiciary. The question of independence of the judiciary would
			<lb />
			arise, with reference to a Judge, only after his appointment as a Judge of
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary. It was submitted, that this Court had repeatedly
			<lb />
			placed reliance on the debates in the Constituent Assembly, so as to
			<lb />
			bring out the intention of the framers of the Constitution, with reference
			<lb />
			to constitutional provisions. In this behalf, he placed reliance on T.M.A.
			<lb />
			Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka 6 , Re: Special Reference No.1 of
			<lb />
			2002 7 , and also on S.R. Chaudhuri v. State of Punjab 8 . The following
			<lb />
			observations in the last cited judgment were highlighted:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;33. Constitutional provisions are required to be understood and
			<lb />
			interpreted with an object-oriented approach. A Constitution must not be
			<lb />
			construed in a narrow and pedantic sense. The words used may be
			<lb />
			general in terms but, their full import and true meaning, has to be
			<lb />
			appreciated considering the true context in which the same are used and
			<lb />
			the purpose which they seek to achieve. Debates in the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly referred to in an earlier part of this judgment clearly indicate
			<lb />
			that a non-member&apos;s inclusion in the Cabinet was considered to be a
			<lb />
			&quot;privilege&quot; that extends only for six months, during which period the
			<lb />
			member must get elected, otherwise he would cease to be a Minister. It is
			<lb />
			a settled position that debates in the Constituent Assembly may be relied
			<lb />
			upon as an aid to interpret a constitutional provision because it is the
			<lb />
			function of the court to find out the intention of the framers of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. We must remember that a Constitution is not just a
			<lb />
			document in solemn form, but a living framework for the Government of
			<lb />
			the people exhibiting a sufficient degree of cohesion and its successful
			<lb />
			working depends upon the democratic spirit underlying it being respected
			<lb />
			in letter and in spirit. The debates clearly indicate the &quot;privilege&quot; to
			<lb />
			extend &quot;only&quot; for six months.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			For the same purpose, he referred to Indra Sawhney v. Union of India 9 ,
			<lb />
			and drew the Court&apos;s attention to the opinion expressed therein:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;217. Further, it is clear for the afore-mentioned reasons that the
			<lb />
			executive while making the division or sub-classification has not properly
			<lb />
			applied its mind to various factors, indicated above which may ultimately
			<lb />
			defeat the very purpose of the division or sub-classification. In that view,
			<lb />
			para 2(i) not only becomes constitutionally invalid but also suffers from
			<lb />
			the vice of non-application of mind and arbitrariness.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />

			<lb />

			<lb />
			772. We may now turn to Constituent Assembly debates with a view to
			<lb />
			ascertain the original intent underlying the use of words &quot;backward class
			<lb />
			of citizens&quot;. At the outset we must clarify that we are not taking these
			<lb />
			debates or even the speeches of Dr Ambedkar as conclusive on the
			<lb />
			meaning of the expression &quot;backward classes&quot;. We are referring to these
			<lb />
			debates as furnishing the context in which and the objective to achieve
			<lb />
			which this phrase was put in clause (4). We are aware that what is said
			<lb />
			during these debates is not conclusive or binding upon the Court
			<lb />
			because several members may have expressed several views, all of which
			<lb />
			may not be reflected in the provision finally enacted. The speech of Dr
			<lb />
			Ambedkar on this aspect, however, stands on a different footing. He was
			<lb />
			not only the Chairman of the Drafting Committee which inserted the
			<lb />
			expression &quot;backward&quot; in draft Article 10(3) [it was not there in the
			<lb />
			original draft Article 10(3)], he was virtually piloting the draft Article. In
			<lb />
			his speech, he explains the reason behind draft clause (3) as also the
			<lb />
			reason for which the Drafting Committee added the expression
			<lb />
			&quot;backward&quot; in the clause. In this situation, we fail to understand how can
			<lb />
			anyone ignore his speech while trying to ascertain the meaning of the
			<lb />
			said expression. That the debates in Constituent Assembly can be relied
			<lb />
			upon as an aid to interpretation of a constitutional provision is borne out
			<lb />
			by a series of decisions of this Court. [See Madhu Limaye, in re, AIR 1969
			<lb />
			SC 1014, Golak Nath v. State of Punjab, AIR 1967 SC 1643 (Subba Rao,
			<lb />
			CJ); opinion of Sikri, CJ, in Union of India v. H.S. Dhillon (1971) 2 SCC
			<lb />
			779 and the several opinions in Kesavananda Bharati (1973) 4 SCC 225,
			<lb />
			where the relevance of these debates is pointed out, emphasing at the
			<lb />
			same time, the extent to which and the purpose for which they can be
			<lb />
			referred to.] Since the expression &quot;backward&quot; or &quot;backward class of
			<lb />
			citizens&quot; is not defined in the Constitution, reference to such debates is
			<lb />
			permissible to ascertain, at any rate, the context, background and
			<lb />
			objective behind them. Particularly, where the Court wants to ascertain
			<lb />
			the &apos;original intent&apos; such reference may be unavoidable.&quot;

			Reliance was also placed on Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala 10 ,
			<lb />
			and this Court&apos;s attention was invited to the following:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;1088. Before I refer to the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly, I
			<lb />
			must first consider the question whether the Constituent Assembly
			<lb />
			Debates can be looked into by the Court for construing these provisions.
			<lb />
			The Advocate-General of Maharashtra says until the decision of this
			<lb />
			Court in H.H. Maharajadhiraja Madhav Rao Jiwaji Rao Scindia Bahadur
			<lb />
			and others v. Union of India, (1971) 1 SCC 85 -commonly known as
			<lb />
			Privy Purses case -debates and proceedings were held not to be
			<lb />
			admissible. Nonetheless counsel on either side made copious reference to
			<lb />
			them. In dealing with the interpretation of ordinary legislation, the widely
			<lb />
			held view is that while it is not permissible to refer to the debates as an
			<lb />
			aid to construction, the various stages through which the draft passed,
			<lb />
			the amendments proposed to it either to add or delete any part of it, the
			<lb />
			purpose for which the attempt was made and the reason for its rejection
			<lb />
			may throw light on the intention of the framers or draftsmen. The
			<lb />
			speeches in the legislatures are said to afford no guide because members
			<lb />
			who speak in favour or against a particular provision or amendment only
			<lb />
			indicate their understanding of the provision which would not be
			<lb />
			admissible as an aid for construing the provision. The members speak
			<lb />
			and express views which differ from one another, and there is no way of
			<lb />
			ascertaining what views are held by those who do not speak. It is,
			<lb />
			therefore, difficult to get a resultant of the views in a debate except for
			<lb />
			the ultimate result that a particular provision or its amendment has been
			<lb />
			adopted or rejected, and in any case none of these can be looked into as
			<lb />
			an aid to construction except that the legislative history of the provision
			<lb />
			can be referred to for finding out the mischief sought to be remedied or
			<lb />
			the purpose for which it is enacted, if they are relevant. But in
			<lb />
			Travancore Cochin and others v. Bombay Company Ltd., AIR 1952 SC
			<lb />
			366, the Golaknath case (supra), the Privy Purses case (supra), and
			<lb />
			Union of India v. H.S. Dhillon, (1971) 2 SCC 779, there are dicta against
			<lb />
			referring to the speeches in the Constituent Assembly and in the last
			<lb />
			mentioned case they were referred to as supporting the conclusion
			<lb />
			already arrived at. In Golaknath case (supra), as well as Privy Purses case
			<lb />
			(supra), the speeches were referred to though it was said not for
			<lb />
			interpreting a provision but for either examining the transcendental
			<lb />
			character of Fundamental Rights or for the circumstances which
			<lb />
			necessitated the giving of guarantees to the rulers. For whatever purpose
			<lb />
			speeches in the Constituent Assembly were looked at though it was
			<lb />
			always claimed that these are not admissible except when the meaning
			<lb />
			was ambiguous or where the meaning was clear for further support of the
			<lb />
			conclusion arrived at. In either case they were looked into. Speaking for
			<lb />
			myself, why should we not look into them boldly for ascertaining what
			<lb />
			was the intention of our framers and how they translated that intention?
			<lb />
			What is the rationale for treating them as forbidden or forbidding
			<lb />
			material. The Court in a constitutional matter, where the intent of the
			<lb />
			framers of the Constitution as embodied in the written document is to be
			<lb />
			ascertained, should look into the proceedings, the relevant data including
			<lb />
			any speech which may throw light on ascertaining it. It can reject them
			<lb />
			as unhelpful, if they throw no light or throw only dim light in which
			<lb />
			nothing can be discerned. Unlike a statute, a Constitution is a working
			<lb />
			instrument of Government, it is drafted by people who wanted it to be a
			<lb />
			national instrument to subserve successive generations. The Assembly
			<lb />
			constituted Committees of able men of high calibre, learning and wide
			<lb />
			experience, and it had an able adviser, Shri B.N. Rau to assist it. A
			<lb />
			memorandum was prepared by Shri B.N. Rau which was circulated to the
			<lb />
			public of every shade of opinion, to professional bodies, to legislators, to
			<lb />
			public bodies and a host of others and was given the widest publicity.
			<lb />
			When criticism, comments and suggestions were received, a draft was
			<lb />
			prepared in the light of these which was submitted to the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly, and introduced with a speech by the sponsor Dr Ambedkar.
			<lb />
			The assembly thereupon constituted three Committees: (1) Union Powers
			<lb />
			Committee; (2) Provincial Powers Committee; and (3) Committee on the
			<lb />
			Fundamental Rights and Minorities Committee. The deliberations and
			<lb />
			the recommendations of these Committees, the proceedings of the
			<lb />
			Drafting Committee, and the speech of Dr Ambedkar introducing the
			<lb />
			draft so prepared along with the report of these Committees are all
			<lb />
			valuable material. The objectives of the Assembly, the manner in which
			<lb />
			they met any criticism, the resultant decisions taken thereupon,
			<lb />
			amendments proposed, speeches in favour or against them and their
			<lb />
			ultimate adoption or rejection will be helpful in throwing light on the
			<lb />
			particular matter in issue. In proceedings of a legislature on an ordinary
			<lb />
			draft bill, as I said earlier, there may be a partisan and heated debate,
			<lb />
			which often times may not throw any light on the issues which come
			<lb />
			before the Court but the proceedings in a Constituent Assembly have no
			<lb />
			such partisan nuances and their only concern is to give the national a
			<lb />
			working instrument with its basic structure and human values
			<lb />
			sufficiently balanced and stable enough to allow an interplay of forces
			<lb />
			which will subserve the needs of future generations. The highest Court
			<lb />
			created under it and charged with the duty of understanding and
			<lb />
			expounding
		</p>
		<item>
			it, should not, if it has to catch the objectives of the framers,
			<lb />
			deny itself the benefit of the guidance derivable from the records of the
			<lb />
			proceedings and the deliberations of the Assembly. Be that as it may, all I
			<lb />
			intend to do for the present is to examine the stages through which the
			<lb />
			draft passed and whether and what attempts were made to introduce
			<lb />
			words or expressions or delete any that were already there and for what
			<lb />
			purpose. If these proceedings are examined from this point of view, do
			<lb />
			they throw any light on or support the view taken by me?&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			For the same proposition, reliance was also placed on Samsher Singh v.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			State of Punjab 11 , and on Manoj Narula v. Union of India 12 .
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			27. Having emphasized, that Constituent Assembly debates, had been
			<lb />
			adopted as a means to understand the true intent and import of the
			<lb />
			provisions of the Constitution, reference was made in extenso to the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly debates, with reference to the provisions (more
			<lb />
			particularly, to Article 124) which are subject matter of the present
			<lb />
			consideration. It was pointed out, that after the constitution of the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly, the issue of judicial appointments and salaries
			<lb />
			was taken up by an ad hoc committee on the Supreme Court. The
			<lb />
			committee comprised of S. Varadachariar (a former Judge of the Federal
			<lb />
			Court), B.L. Mitter (a former Advocate General of the Federal Court), in
			<lb />
			addition to some noted jurists -Alladi Krishnaswamy Ayyar, K.M.
			<lb />
			Munshi and B.N. Rau (Constitutional Adviser to the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly of India). The ad hoc committee presented its report to the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly on 21.5.1947. With reference to judicial
			<lb />
			independence, it modified the consultative proposal suggested in the
			<lb />
			Sapru Committee report, by recommending a panel of 11 persons,
			<lb />
			nominated by the President, in consultation with the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India. Alternatively, it was suggested, that the panel would recommend
			<lb />
			three candidates, and the President in consultation with the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, would choose one of the three. It was suggested, that
			<lb />
			the panel would take its decision(s) by 2/3rd majority. To ensure
			<lb />
			independence, it was recommended, that the panel should have a tenure
			<lb />
			of ten years. Based on the above report, it was submitted, that the
			<lb />
			proposal suggested a wider participation of a collegium of Judges,
			<lb />
			politicians and law officers, in addition to the President and the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, in the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary. Learned Attorney General went on to inform the Court, that on
			<lb />
			the basis of the above report, B.N. Rau prepared a memorandum dated
			<lb />
			30.5.1947, wherein he made his own suggestions. The above suggestions
			<lb />
			related to Judges of the Supreme Court, as also, of High Courts. The
			<lb />
			Court was also informed, that the Union Constitution Committee
			<lb />
			presented its report to the Constituent Assembly on 4.7.1947, also
			<lb />
			pertaining to appointments to the higher judiciary. Yet another
			<lb />
			memorandum, on the Principles of a Model Provincial Constitution was
			<lb />
			prepared by the Constitutional Adviser on 13.5.1947, relating to
			<lb />
			appointments to the higher judiciary, which was adopted by the
			<lb />
			Provincial Constitution Committee. Reliance was placed by the Attorney
			<lb />
			General, on the speech delivered by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on
			<lb />
			15.7.1947, wherein he expressed the following views:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The committee have given special attention to the appointment of judges
			<lb />
			of the High Court. This is considered to be very important by the
			<lb />
			committee and as the judiciary should be above suspicion and should be
			<lb />
			above party influences, it was agreed that the appointment of High Court
			<lb />
			judges should be made by the President of the Union in consultation with
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice of the
			<lb />
			Provincial High Court and the Governor with the advice of the Ministry of
			<lb />
			the Province concerned. So there are many checks provided to ensure fair
			<lb />
			appointments to the High Court.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			The Court was informed, that the first draft of the new constitution
			<lb />
			prepared by B.N. Rau was presented to the Constituent Assembly in
			<lb />
			October 1947, wherein, it was expressed that Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court, would be appointed by the President, in consultation with the
			<lb />
			sitting Judges of the Supreme Court, and Judges of High Courts in
			<lb />
			consultation with the Chief Justice of India, except in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of the Chief Justice of India himself. It was suggested, that
			<lb />
			this was the immediate precursor to Article 124(2) of the Constitution, as
			<lb />
			it was originally framed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			28. It was pointed out, that in the above report prepared by the
			<lb />
			Constitutional Adviser, the following passage related to the judiciary:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Regarding the removal of judges, he (Justice Frankfurter, Judge,
			<lb />
			Supreme Court of the United States of America) drew attention to a
			<lb />
			provision which had just been proposed in New York State -the provision
			<lb />
			has since been approved and which had the support of most of the
			<lb />
			judges and lawyers in this country. The provision is reproduced below:
			<lb />
			9-a (1) A judge of the court of appeals, a justice of the supreme court, a
			<lb />
			judge of the court of claims… (types of judges) may be removed or retired
			<lb />
			also by a court on the judiciary. The court shall be composed of the chief
			<lb />
			judge of the court of appeals, the senior associate judges of the court of
			<lb />
			appeals and one justice of the appellate division in each department
			<lb />
			designated by concurrence of a majority of the justices of such appellate
			<lb />
			division…
			<lb />
			(2) No judicial officer shall be removed by virtue of this section except for
			<lb />
			cause or be retired except for mental or physical disability preventing the
			<lb />
			proper performance of his judicial duties, nor unless he shall have been
			<lb />
			served with a statement of the charges alleged for his removal or the
			<lb />
			grounds for his retirement, and shall have had an opportunity to be
			<lb />
			heard…
			<lb />
			(3) The trial of charges for the removal of a judicial officer or of the
			<lb />
			grounds for his retirement shall be held before a court on the judiciary…
			<lb />
			(4) The chief judge of the court of appeals may convene the court on the
			<lb />
			judiciary upon his own motion and shall convene the court upon written
			<lb />
			request by the governor or by the presiding justice of any appellate
			<lb />
			division…&quot;
			<lb />
			It was submitted, that the above suggestion of vesting the power of
			<lb />
			impeachment, in-house by the judiciary itself, as recommended by
			<lb />
			Justice Frankfurter, was rejected. It was pointed out, that the second
			<lb />
			draft of the Constitution was placed before the Constituent Assembly on
			<lb />
			21.2.1948. Articles 103 and 193 of the above draft, pertained to
			<lb />
			appointments of Judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that several public comments were received, with reference to
			<lb />
			the second draft. In this behalf, a memorandum was also received, from
			<lb />
			the Judges of the Federal Court and the Chief Justices of the High Courts
			<lb />
			which, inter alia, expressed as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;It seems desirable to insert a provision in these articles (Draft Articles
			<lb />
			103(2) and 193(2) to the effect that no person should be appointed a
			<lb />
			judge of the Supreme Court or of a High Court who has at any time
			<lb />
			accepted the post of a Minister in the Union of India or in any State. This
			<lb />
			is intended to prevent a person who has accepted office of a Minister from
			<lb />
			exercising his influence in order to become a judge at any time. It is the
			<lb />
			unanimous view of the judges that a member of the Indian Civil Service
			<lb />
			should not be a permanent Chief Justice of any High Court. Suitable
			<lb />
			provision should be made in the article for this.&quot;
			<lb />
			It was submitted, that in response to the above memorandum, B.N. Rau
			<lb />
			made the following observations:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;It is unnecessary to put these prohibitions into the Constitution. The
			<lb />
			Attorney-General in England is invariably one of the Ministers of the
			<lb />
			Crown and often even a Cabinet Minister; he is often appointed a judge
			<lb />
			afterwards (The Lord Chancellor is, of course, both a Cabinet Minister
			<lb />
			and the head of the judiciary). In India, Sapru and Sircar were Law
			<lb />
			Members, or Law Ministers, as they would be called in future; no one
			<lb />
			would suggest that men of this type should be ineligible for appointment
			<lb />
			as judges afterwards…
			<lb />
			Merit should be the only criterion for these high appointments; no
			<lb />
			constitutional ban should stand in the way of merit being recognized.&quot;
			<lb />
			It was asserted, that in the memorandum submitted by the Judges of the
			<lb />
			Federal Court and the Chief Justices of the High Courts, the following
			<lb />
			suggestions were made:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;It is therefore suggested that Article 193(1) may be worded in the
			<lb />
			following or other suitable manner:
			<lb />
			Every Judge of the High Court shall be appointed by the President by a
			<lb />
			warrant under his hand and seal on the recommendation of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of the High Court after consultation with the Governor of the
			<lb />
			State and with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India…
			<lb />
			We do not think it is necessary to make any provision in the Constitution
			<lb />
			for the possibility of the Chief Justice of India refusing to concur in an
			<lb />
			appointment proposed by the President. Both are officers of the highest
			<lb />
			responsibility and so far no case of such refusal has arisen although a
			<lb />
			convention now exists that such appointments should be made after
			<lb />
			referring the matter to the Chief Justice of India and obtaining his
			<lb />
			concurrence. If per chance such a situation were ever to arise it could of
			<lb />
			course be met by the President making a different proposal, and no
			<lb />
			express provision need, it seems to us, be made in that behalf.
			<lb />
			The foregoing applies mutatis mutandi s to the appointment of the Judges
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court, and article 103(2) may also be suitably modified.
			<lb />
			In this connection it is not appreciated why a constitutional obligation
			<lb />
			should be cast on the President to consult any Judge or Judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court or of the High Court in the States before appointing a
			<lb />
			Judge of the Supreme Court. There is nothing to prevent the President
			<lb />
			from consulting them whenever he deems it necessary to do so.&quot;
			<lb />
			It was pointed out, that none of the above proposals were accepted.
			<lb />
			Reference was also made to the Editor of the Indian Law Review and the
			<lb />
			Members of the Calcutta Bar Association, who made the following
			<lb />
			suggestions:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;That in clause (4) of Article 103 the words &quot;and voting&quot; should be
			<lb />
			deleted, as they consider that in an important issue as the one
			<lb />
			contemplated in this clause, opportunity should be as much minimized
			<lb />
			as practicable for the legislators for remaining neutral.&quot;
			<lb />
			to which, the response of B.N. Rau was as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;In the Constitutions of Canada, Australia, South Africa and Ireland, a
			<lb />
			bare majority of the members present and voting suffices for the
			<lb />
			presentation of the address for removal of a judge. Article 103(4) requires
			<lb />
			a two-thirds majority of those present and voting. It is hardly necessary
			<lb />
			to tighten it further by deleting the words &quot;and voting&quot;.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			With reference to the suggestions regarding non-reduction of salaries of
			<lb />
			Judges, the Constitutional Adviser made the following comments:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;The constitutional safeguard against the reduction of salary of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice and the judges of a High Court below the minimum has been
			<lb />
			prescribed in article 197 so as to prevent the Legislatures of the States
			<lb />
			from reducing the salaries below a reasonable figure. It is hardly
			<lb />
			necessary to put such a check on the power of Parliament to fix the
			<lb />
			salaries of the judges of the Supreme Court.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The suggestions made by Pittabhi Sitaramayya and others, with reference
			<lb />
			to officers, and servants and the expenses of the Supreme Court, were
			<lb />
			also highlighted. They are extracted hereunder:
			<lb />
			&quot;That in article 122, for the words &quot;the Chief Justice of India in
			<lb />
			consultation with the President&quot; the words &quot;the President in consultation
			<lb />
			with the Chief Justice of India&quot; be substituted.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			The response of the Constitutional Adviser was as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The provision for the fixation of the salaries, allowances and pensions of
			<lb />
			the officers and servants of the Supreme Court by the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India in consultation with the President contained in clause (1) of article
			<lb />
			122 is based on the existing provision contained in section 242(4) of the
			<lb />
			Government of India Act, 1935, as adapted. The Drafting Committee
			<lb />
			considered such a provision to be necessary to ensure the independence
			<lb />
			of the judiciary, the safeguarding of which was so much stressed by the
			<lb />
			Federal Court and the High Courts in their comments on the Draft
			<lb />
			Constitution.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			29. It was pointed out, that the second draft of the Constitution, was
			<lb />
			introduced in the Constituent Assembly on 4.11.1948. The Court&apos;s
			<lb />
			attention was drawn to the discussions, with reference to appointments
			<lb />
			to the higher judiciary, including the suggestion of B. Pocker Sahib, who
			<lb />
			proposed an alternative to Article 103(2). Reference was also made to the
			<lb />
			proposal made by Mahboob Ali Baig Sahib, guarding against party
			<lb />
			influences, that may be brought to the fore, with reference to
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges. It was submitted, that the above suggestion was
			<lb />
			rejected by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, who felt that it
			<lb />
			would be dangerous to enable the Chief Justice to veto the appointment
			<lb />
			of a Judge to the higher judiciary. The opinion of T.T. Krishnamachari
			<lb />
			was also to the following effect:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;[T]he independence of the Judiciary should be maintained and that the
			<lb />
			Judiciary should not feel that they are subject to favours that the
			<lb />
			Executive might grant to them from time to time and which would
			<lb />
			naturally influence their decision in any matter they have to take where
			<lb />
			the interests of the Executive of the time being happens to be concerned.
			<lb />
			At the same time, Sir, I think it should be made clear that it is not the
			<lb />
			intention of this House or of the framers of this Constitution that they
			<lb />
			want to crate specially favoured bodies which in themselves becomes an
			<lb />
			Imperium in Imperio, completely independent of the Executive and the
			<lb />
			legislature and operating as a sort of superior body to the general body
			<lb />
			politic&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			30. The proposals and the decision taken thereon, were brought to our
			<lb />
			notice, specially the observations made by K.T. Shah, K.M. Munshi,
			<lb />
			Tajamul Husain, Alladi Krishnaswami Aayar, Ananthasayanam
			<lb />
			Ayyangar, and finally Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar had stated
			<lb />
			thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Finally, BR Ambedkar said:
			<lb />
			Mr. President, Sir, I would just like to make a few observations in order
			<lb />
			to clear the position. Sir, there is no doubt that the House in general, has
			<lb />
			agreed that the independence of the Judiciary from the Executive should
			<lb />
			be made as clear and definite as we could make it by law. At the same
			<lb />
			time, there is the fear that in the name of the independence of the
			<lb />
			Judiciary,
			<lb />
			we
			<lb />
			might
			<lb />
			be
			<lb />
			creating,
			<lb />
			what
			<lb />
			my
			<lb />
			Friend
			<lb />
			Mr.
			<lb />
			T.T. Krishnamachari very aptly called an &quot;Imperium in Imperio&quot;. We do not
			<lb />
			want to create an Imperium in Imperio , and at the same time we want to
			<lb />
			give the Judiciary ample independence so that it can act without fear or
			<lb />
			favour of the Executive. My friends, if they will carefully examine the
			<lb />
			provisions of the new amendment which I have proposed in place of the
			<lb />
			original article 122, will find that the new article proposes to steer a
			<lb />
			middle course. It refuses to create an Imperium in Imperio, and I think it
			<lb />
			gives the Judiciary as much independence as is necessary for the
			<lb />
			purpose of administering justice without fear or favour.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			31. Having extensively brought to our notice, the nature of the debates
			<lb />
			before the Constituent Assembly, and the decisions taken thereon, the
			<lb />
			learned Attorney General ventured to demonstrate, that the participation
			<lb />
			of the executive in the matter of appointment of high constitutional
			<lb />
			functionaries, &quot;could not -and did not&quot;, impinge upon their
			<lb />
			independence, in the discharge of their duties. Illustratively, reliance
			<lb />
			was placed on Part IV Chapter V of the Constitution, comprising of 4
			<lb />
			Articles of the Constitution (Articles 148 to 151), dealing with the
			<lb />
			Comptroller and Auditor-General of India. It was submitted, that duties
			<lb />
			and powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India, delineated
			<lb />
			in Article 149, revealed, that the position of the Comptroller and
			<lb />
			Auditor-General of India, was no less in importance vis-a-vis the Judges
			<lb />
			of the higher judiciary. Pointing out to Article 148, it was his contention,
			<lb />
			that the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India is
			<lb />
			made by the President. His removal under clause (1) of Article 148 could
			<lb />
			only, in the like manner, be made on the like grounds as a Judge of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court of India. Just like a Judge of the Supreme Court, his
			<lb />
			salary and other conditions of service were to be determined by
			<lb />
			Parliament by law, and until they were so determined, they were to be as
			<lb />
			expressed in the Second Schedule. Further more, just like a Judge of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court, neither the salary of the Comptroller and
			<lb />
			Auditor-General, nor his rights in respect of leave of absence, pension or
			<lb />
			age of retirement, could be varied to his disadvantage, after his
			<lb />
			appointment. In a similar fashion, as in the case of the Supreme Court,
			<lb />
			persons serving in the Indian Audit and Accounts Department, were to be
			<lb />
			subject to such conditions of service, as were determined by law made by
			<lb />
			Parliament, and till such legislative enactment was made, their
			<lb />
			conditions of service were determinable by the President, by framing
			<lb />
			rules, in consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India.
			<lb />
			Based on the above, it was contended, that even though the appointment
			<lb />
			of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India, was exclusively vested
			<lb />
			with the executive, there had never been an adverse murmur with
			<lb />
			reference to his being influenced by the executive. The inference sought
			<lb />
			to be drawn was, that the manner of &quot;appointment&quot; is irrelevant, to the
			<lb />
			question of independence. Independence of an authority, according to the
			<lb />
			learned Attorney General, emerged from the protection of the conditions
			<lb />
			of the incumbent&apos;s service, after the appointment had been made.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			32. In the like manner, our attention was drawn to Part XV of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, pertaining to elections. It was submitted, that Article 324
			<lb />
			vested the superintendence, direction and control of elections to the
			<lb />
			Parliament, and the Legislatures of every State, and election to the offices
			<lb />
			of President and Vice-President, with the Election Commission. The
			<lb />
			Election Commission in terms of Article 324(2) was comprised of the
			<lb />
			Chief Election Commissioner, and such number of other Election
			<lb />
			Commissioners as the President may from time to time fix. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner, and
			<lb />
			the other Election Commissioners, was to be made by the President, and
			<lb />
			was subject to the provisions of law made by Parliament. It was further
			<lb />
			pointed out, that under Article 324(5), the conditions of service and the
			<lb />
			tenure of the office of the Election Commissioners (and the Regional
			<lb />
			Commissioners) is regulated in the manner, as the President may by
			<lb />
			rules determine. Of course, subject to, enactment of law by Parliament.
			<lb />
			So as to depict similarity with the matter under consideration, it was
			<lb />
			contended, that the proviso under Article 324(5) was explicit to the effect,
			<lb />
			that the Chief Election Commissioner could not be removed from his
			<lb />
			office, except in like manner, and on like grounds, as a Judge of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court. And further more, that the conditions of service of the
			<lb />
			Chief Election Commissioner, could not be varied to his disadvantage,
			<lb />
			after his appointment. It was contended, that the Indian experience had
			<lb />
			been, that the Chief Election Commissioner, and the other Election
			<lb />
			Commissioners, had functioned with absolute independence, and that,
			<lb />
			their functioning remained unaffected, despite the fact that their
			<lb />
			appointment had been made, by the executive. It was submitted, that
			<lb />
			impartiality/independence emerged from the protection of the conditions
			<lb />
			of service of the incumbent after his appointment, and not by the method
			<lb />
			or manner of his appointment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			33. It was also the contention of the learned Attorney General, that
			<lb />
			implicit in the scheme of the Constitution, was a system of checks and
			<lb />
			balances, wherein the different constitutional functionaries participate in
			<lb />
			various processes of selection, appointment, etc., so as to ensure, that
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			constitutional
			<lb />
			functionaries
			<lb />
			did
			<lb />
			not
			<lb />
			exceed,
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			functions/responsibilities assigned to them. To substantiate the above
			<lb />
			contention, reliance was placed on the Kesavananda Bharati case 10 ,
			<lb />
			wherein this Court observed as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;577. We are unable to see how the power of judicial review makes the
			<lb />
			judiciary supreme in any sense of the word. This power is of paramount
			<lb />
			importance in a federal Constitution. Indeed it has been said that the
			<lb />
			heart and core of a democracy lies in the judicial process; (per Bose, J.,
			<lb />
			in Bidi Supply Co. v. Union of India, AIR 1956 SC 479). The observations
			<lb />
			of Patanjali Sastri, C.J., in State of Madras v. V.G. Row, AIR 1952 SC
			<lb />
			196, which have become locus classicus need alone be repeated in this
			<lb />
			connection. Judicial review is undertaken by the courts &quot;not out of any
			<lb />
			desire to tilt at legislative authority in a crusader&apos;s spirit, but in
			<lb />
			discharge of a duty plainly laid down upon them by the Constitution&quot;.
			<lb />
			The respondents have also contended that to let the court have judicial
			<lb />
			review over constitutional amendments would mean involving the court
			<lb />
			in political questions. To this the answer may be given in the words of
			<lb />
			Lord Porter in Commonwealth of Australia v. Bank of New South Wales
			<lb />
			1950 AC 235 at 310:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;The problem to be solved will often be not so much legal as political,
			<lb />
			social or economic, yet it must be solved by a court of law. For where the
			<lb />
			dispute is, as here, not only between Commonwealth and citizen but
			<lb />
			between Commonwealth and intervening States on the one hand and
			<lb />
			citizens and States on the other, it is only the Court that can decide the
			<lb />
			issue, it is vain to invoke the voice of Parliament.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			There is ample evidence in the Constitution itself to indicate that it
			<lb />
			creates a system of checks and balances by reason of which powers are
			<lb />
			so distributed that none of the three organs it sets up can become so
			<lb />
			pre-dominant as to disable the others from exercising and discharging
			<lb />
			powers and functions entrusted to them. Though the Constitution does
			<lb />
			not lay down the principle of separation of powers in all its rigidity as is
			<lb />
			the case in the United States Constitution but it envisages such a
			<lb />
			separation to a degree as was found in Ranasinghe&apos;s case. The judicial
			<lb />
			review provided expressly in our Constitution by means of Articles 226
			<lb />
			and 32 is one of the features upon which hinges the system of checks
			<lb />
			and balances. Apart from that, as already stated, the necessity for
			<lb />
			judicial decision on the competence or otherwise of an Act arises from
			<lb />
			the very federal nature of a Constitution (per Haldane, L.C. in
			<lb />
			Attorney-General for the Commonwealth of Australia v. Colonial Sugar
			<lb />
			Refining Co. 1914 AC 237 and Ex Parte Walsh &amp; Johnson; In re Yates,
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(1925) 37 CLR 36 at p.58. The function of interpretation of a Constitution
			<lb />
			being thus assigned to the judicial power of the State, the question
			<lb />
			whether the subject of a law is within the ambit of one or more powers of
			<lb />
			the Legislature conferred by the Constitution would always be a question
			<lb />
			of interpretation of the Constitution. It may be added that at no stage the
			<lb />
			respondents have contested the proposition that the validity of a
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment can be the subject of review by this Court.
			<lb />
			The Advocate-General of Maharashtra has characterised judicial review
			<lb />
			as undemocratic. That cannot, however, be so in our Constitution
			<lb />
			because of the provisions relating to the appointment of judges, the
			<lb />
			specific restriction to which the fundamental rights are made subject, the
			<lb />
			deliberate exclusion of the due process clause in Article 21 and the
			<lb />
			affirmation in Article 141 that judges declare but not make law. To this
			<lb />
			may be added the none too rigid amendatory process which authorises
			<lb />
			amendment by means of 2/3 majority and the additional requirement of
			<lb />
			ratification.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The Court&apos;s attention was also invited to the observations recorded in
			<lb />
			Bhim Singh v. Union of India 13 :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;77. Another contention raised by the petitioners is that the Scheme
			<lb />
			violates the principle of separation of powers under the Constitution. The
			<lb />
			concept of separation of powers, even though not found in any particular
			<lb />
			constitutional provision, is inherent in the polity the Constitution has
			<lb />
			adopted. The aim of separation of powers is to achieve the maximum
			<lb />
			extent of accountability of each branch of the Government.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			78. While understanding this concept, two aspects must be borne in
			<lb />
			mind. One, that separation of powers is an essential feature of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. Two, that in modern governance, a strict separation is
			<lb />
			neither possible, nor desirable. Nevertheless, till this principle of
			<lb />
			accountability is preserved, there is no violation of separation of powers.
			<lb />
			We arrive at the same conclusion when we assess the position within the
			<lb />
			constitutional text. The Constitution does not prohibit overlap of
			<lb />
			functions, but in fact provides for some overlap as a parliamentary
			<lb />
			democracy. But what it prohibits is such exercise of function of the other
			<lb />
			branch which results in wresting away of the regime of constitutional
			<lb />
			accountability.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			79. In Ram Jawaya Kapur v. State of Punjab, AIR 1955 SC 549, this
			<lb />
			Court held that: (AIR p. 556, para 12)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;12. …The Indian Constitution has not indeed recognised the doctrine of
			<lb />
			separation of powers in its absolute rigidity but the functions of the
			<lb />
			different parts or branches of the Government have been sufficiently
			<lb />
			differentiated and consequently it can very well be said that our
			<lb />
			Constitution does not contemplate assumption, by one organ or part of
			<lb />
			the State, of functions that essentially belong to another. The executive
			<lb />
			indeed can exercise the powers of departmental or subordinate legislation
			<lb />
			when such powers are delegated to it by the legislature.
			<lb />
			It can also, when so empowered, exercise judicial functions in a limited
			<lb />
			way. The executive Government, however, can never go against the
			<lb />
			provisions of the Constitution or of any law.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			80. In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973) 4 SCC 225, and
			<lb />
			later in Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1976) 3 SCC 321, this Court
			<lb />
			declared separation of powers to be a part of the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. In Kesavananda Bharati case Shelat and Grover, JJs. in
			<lb />
			SCC para 577 observed the precise nature of the concept as follows: (SCC
			<lb />
			p. 452)
			<lb />
			&quot;577. … There is ample evidence in the Constitution itself to indicate that
			<lb />
			it creates a system of checks and balances by reason of which powers are
			<lb />
			so distributed that none of the three organs it sets up can become so
			<lb />
			predominant as to disable the others from exercising and discharging
			<lb />
			powers and functions entrusted to them. Though the Constitution does
			<lb />
			not lay down the principle of separation of powers in all its rigidity as is
			<lb />
			the case in the United States Constitution yet it envisages such a
			<lb />
			separation to a degree as was found in Ranasinghe case. The judicial
			<lb />
			review provided expressly in our Constitution by means of Articles 226
			<lb />
			and 32 is one of the features upon which hinges the system of checks
			<lb />
			and balances.&quot;
			<lb />
			and conclusion no.5, which is reproduced as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;…..
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(5) Indian Constitution does not recognise strict separation of powers.
			<lb />
			The constitutional principle of separation of powers will only be violated
			<lb />
			if an essential function of one branch is taken over by another branch,
			<lb />
			leading to a removal of checks and balances.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Last of all, the learned Attorney General placed reliance on State of U.P.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			v. Jeet S. Bisht 14 , wherein this Court held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;78. Separation of powers in one sense is a limit on active jurisdiction of
			<lb />
			each organ. But it has another deeper and more relevant purpose: to act
			<lb />
			as check and balance over the activities of other organs. Thereby the
			<lb />
			active jurisdiction of the organ is not challenged; nevertheless there are
			<lb />
			methods of prodding to communicate the institution of its excesses and
			<lb />
			shortfall in duty. Constitutional mandate sets the dynamics of this
			<lb />
			communication between the organs of polity. Therefore, it is suggested to
			<lb />
			not understand separation of powers as operating in vacuum. Separation
			<lb />
			of powers doctrine has been reinvented in modern times.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			34. The learned Attorney General emphasized, that there was a very
			<lb />
			serious and sharp cleavage of opinion on the subject, which is being
			<lb />
			canvassed before this Court. Relying on the judgment rendered by in the
			<lb />
			Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth case 5 , he pointed out, that in the aforesaid
			<lb />
			judgment, this Court had arrived at the conclusion, that the term
			<lb />
			&quot;consultation&quot; could not be deemed to be &quot;concurrence&quot;, with reference to
			<lb />
			Article 222. In conjunction with the above, he invited our attention to
			<lb />
			the judgment in the Samsher Singh case 11 , wherein a seven-Judge
			<lb />
			Bench, which was dealing with a controversy relating to Judges of
			<lb />
			subordinate courts, and the impact of Article 311, had examined the
			<lb />
			question whether the President was to act in his individual capacity, i.e.,
			<lb />
			at his own discretion; or he was liable to act on the aid and advice of the
			<lb />
			Council of Ministers, as mandated under Article 74. Reliance was placed
			<lb />
			on the following observations from the aforesaid judgment:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;149. In the light of the scheme of the Constitution we have already
			<lb />
			referred to, it is doubtful whether such an interpretation as to the
			<lb />
			personal satisfaction of the President is correct. We are of the view that
			<lb />
			the President means, for all practical purposes, the Minister or the
			<lb />
			Council of Ministers as the case may be, and his opinion, satisfaction or
			<lb />
			decision is constitutionally secured when his Ministers arrive at such
			<lb />
			opinion satisfaction or decision. The independence of the Judiciary,
			<lb />
			which is a cardinal principle of the Constitution and has been relied on to
			<lb />
			justify the deviation, is guarded by the relevant article making
			<lb />
			consultation with the Chief Justice of India obligatory. In all conceivable
			<lb />
			cases consultation with that highest dignitary of Indian justice will and
			<lb />
			should be accepted by the Government of India and the Court will have
			<lb />
			an opportunity to examine if any other extraneous circumstances have
			<lb />
			entered into the verdict of the Minister, if he departs from the counsel
			<lb />
			given by the Chief Justice of India. In practice the last word in such a
			<lb />
			sensitive subject must belong to the Chief Justice of India, the rejection
			<lb />
			of his advice being ordinarily regarded as prompted by oblique
			<lb />
			considerations vitiating the order. In this view it is immaterial whether
			<lb />
			the President or the Prime Minister or the Minister for Justice formally
			<lb />
			decides the issue.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			35. It was submitted, that the aforesaid observations as were recorded
			<lb />
			in the Samsher Singh case 11 , were relied upon in the Second Judges
			<lb />
			case. This Court, it was pointed out, had clarified that the observations
			<lb />
			recorded in paragraph 149 in the Samsher Singh case 11 , were merely in
			<lb />
			the nature of an obiter. It was submitted, that the aforesaid observations
			<lb />
			in the Samsher Singh case 11 , were also noticed in paragraph 383 (at page
			<lb />
			665), wherein it was sought to be concluded, that the President, for all
			<lb />
			practical purposes, should be construed, as the concerned Minister or
			<lb />
			the Council of Ministers. Having noticed the constitutional provisions
			<lb />
			regarding &quot;consultation&quot; with the judiciary, this Court had expressed,
			<lb />
			that the Government was bound by such counsel. Reference was then
			<lb />
			made to the judgment of this Court in the First Judges case, wherein it
			<lb />
			was held, that &quot;consultation&quot; did not include &quot;concurrence&quot;, and further,
			<lb />
			that the power of appointment of Judges under Article 124, was vested
			<lb />
			with the President, and also, that the President could override the views
			<lb />
			of the consultees.
			<lb />
			Last of all, to substantiate his submission(s)
			<lb />
			pertaining to the cleavage of opinion, reliance was placed on the
			<lb />
			Kesavananda Bharati case 10 , wherein a thirteen-Judge Bench of this
			<lb />
			Court, had held, with reference to the power of amendment under Article
			<lb />
			368, that the concept of &quot;basic structure&quot;, was a limitation, to the
			<lb />
			otherwise plenary power of amendment of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			36. In his effort to persuade us, to refer the instant matter, to a
			<lb />
			nine-Judge Bench (or, to a still larger Bench), the learned Attorney
			<lb />
			General placed reliance on Suraz India Trust v. Union of India 15 , and
			<lb />
			invited our attention to the following:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;3. Shri A.K. Ganguli, learned Senior Advocate, has submitted that the
			<lb />
			method of appointment of a Supreme Court Judge is mentioned in Article
			<lb />
			124(2) of the Constitution of India which states:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;124. (2) Every Judge of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the
			<lb />
			President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with
			<lb />
			such of the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the
			<lb />
			States as the President may deem necessary for the purpose and shall
			<lb />
			hold office until he attains the age of sixty-five years.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Provided that in the case of appointment of a Judge other than the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice, the Chief Justice of India shall always be consulted.&quot;
			<lb />
			It may be noted that there is no mention:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(i) Of any Collegium in Article 124(2).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) The word used in Article 124(2) is &quot;consultation&quot;, and not
			<lb />
			&quot;concurrence&quot;.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii) The President of India while appointing a Supreme Court Judge can
			<lb />
			consult any Judge of the Supreme Court or even the High Court as he
			<lb />
			deems necessary for the purpose, and is not bound to consult only the
			<lb />
			five seniormost Judges of the Supreme Court.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			4. That by the judicial verdicts in the aforesaid two cases, Article 124(2)
			<lb />
			has been practically amended, although amendment to the Constitution
			<lb />
			can only be done by Parliament in accordance with the procedure laid
			<lb />
			down in Article 368 of the Constitution of India.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			5. That under Article 124(2) while appointing a Supreme Court Judge,
			<lb />
			the President of India has to consult the Chief Justice of India, but he
			<lb />
			may also consult any other Supreme Court Judge and not merely the
			<lb />
			four seniormost Judges. Also, the President of India can even consult a
			<lb />
			High Court Judge, whereas, according to the aforesaid two decisions the
			<lb />
			President of India cannot consult any Supreme Court Judge other than
			<lb />
			the four seniormost Judges of the Supreme Court, and he cannot consult
			<lb />
			any High Court Judge at all.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			6. Shri Ganguli submits that the matter is required to be considered by a
			<lb />
			larger Bench as the petition raises the following issues of constitutional
			<lb />
			importance:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(1) Whether the aforesaid two verdicts viz. the seven-Judge Bench and
			<lb />
			nine-Judge Bench decisions of this Court referred to above really amount
			<lb />
			to amending Article 124(2) of the Constitution?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2) Whether there is any &quot;Collegium&quot; system for appointing the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court or High Court Judges in the Constitution?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(3) Whether the Constitution can be amended by a judicial verdict or can
			<lb />
			it only be amended by Parliament in accordance with Article 368?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(4) Whether the constitutional scheme was that the Supreme Court and
			<lb />
			High Court Judges can be appointed by mutual discussions and mutual
			<lb />
			consensus between the judiciary and the executive; or whether the
			<lb />
			judiciary can alone appoint Judges of the Supreme Court and High
			<lb />
			Courts?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(5) Whether the word &quot;consultation&quot; in Article 224 means &quot;concurrence&quot;?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(6) Whether by judicial interpretation words in the Constitution can be
			<lb />
			made redundant, as appears to have been done in the aforesaid two
			<lb />
			decisions which have made consultation with the High Court Judges
			<lb />
			redundant while appointing a Supreme Court Judge despite the fact that
			<lb />
			it is permissible on the clear language of Article 124(2)?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(7) Whether the clear language of Article 124(2) can be altered by judicial
			<lb />
			verdicts and instead of allowing the President of India to consult such
			<lb />
			Judges of the Supreme Court as he deems necessary (including even
			<lb />
			junior Judges) only the Chief Justice of India and four seniormost
			<lb />
			Judges of the Supreme Court can alone be consulted while appointing a
			<lb />
			Supreme Court Judge?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(8) Whether there was any convention that the President is bound by the
			<lb />
			advice of the Chief Justice of India, and whether any such convention
			<lb />
			(assuming there was one) can prevail over the clear language of Article
			<lb />
			124(2)?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(9) Whether the opinion of the Chief Justice of India has any primacy in
			<lb />
			the aforesaid appointments?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(10) Whether the aforesaid two decisions should be overruled by a larger
			<lb />
			Bench?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			7. Mr G.E. Vahanvati, learned Attorney General for India, supports the
			<lb />
			petitioner
			<lb />
			contending
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			aforesaid
			<lb />
			judgments
			<lb />
			require
			<lb />
			reconsideration. However, he also submits:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(
		</item>
		<note type="other">
			a) A writ petition under Article 32 is not maintainable at the behest of a
			<lb />
			trust as the trust cannot claim violation of any of its fundamental rights;
			<lb />
		</note>
		<p>
			(b) The petitioner has no locus standi to seek review of the judgments of
			<lb />
			this Court. In fact, a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution does
			<lb />
			not lie to challenge the correctness of a judicial order; and
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(c) A Bench of two Judges cannot examine the correctness of the
			<lb />
			judgment of a nine-Judge Bench.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(d) A Bench of two Judges cannot refer the matter to the larger Bench of
			<lb />
			nine Judges or more, directly.
			<lb />
			xxxx
			<lb />
			xxxx
			<lb />
			xxxx
			<lb />
			11. However, Mr Ganguli dealing with the issue of locus standi of the
			<lb />
			Trust has submitted that the petition may not be maintainable but it
			<lb />
			should be entertained because it raises a large number of substantial
			<lb />
			questions of law. In order to fortify his submission he places reliance
			<lb />
			upon a recent Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in B.P. Singhal
			<lb />
			v. Union of India (2010) 6 SCC 331 wherein while dealing with the issue
			<lb />
			of removal of Governors, this Court held as under: (SCC p. 346, para 15)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			15. The petitioner has no locus to maintain the petition in regard to the
			<lb />
			prayers claiming relief for the benefit of the individual Governors. At all
			<lb />
			events, such prayers no longer survive on account of passage of time.
			<lb />
			However, with regard to the general question of public importance
			<lb />
			referred to the Constitution Bench, touching upon the scope of Article
			<lb />
			156(1) and the limitations upon the doctrine of pleasure, the petitioner
			<lb />
			has the necessary locus.&quot;
			<lb />
			Thus, Mr Ganguli submits that considering the gravity of the issues
			<lb />
			involved herein, the matter should be entertained.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			12. While dealing with the issue of reference to the larger Bench, Mr
			<lb />
			Ganguli has placed a very heavy reliance on the recent order of this
			<lb />
			Court dated 30-3-2011 in Mineral Area Development Authority v. SAIL
			<lb />
			(2011) 4 SCC 450, wherein considering the issue of interpretation of the
			<lb />
			constitutional provisions and validity of the Act involved therein, a
			<lb />
			three-Judge Bench presided over by the Hon&apos;ble Chief Justice has
			<lb />
			referred the matter to a nine-Judge Bench.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			13. At this juncture, Mr Ganguli as well as Mr Vahanvati have submitted
			<lb />
			that even at the stage of preliminary hearing for admission of the
			<lb />
			petition, the matter requires to be heard by a larger Bench as this matter
			<lb />
			has earlier been dealt with by a three-Judge Bench and involves very
			<lb />
			complicated legal issues.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			14. In view of the above, we place the matter before the Hon&apos;ble the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice for appropriate directions.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			It was pointed out, that when the above matter was placed before a
			<lb />
			three-Judge Bench of this Court, the same was dismissed on the ground
			<lb />
			of locus standi. Yet, since the above order was passed in the absence of
			<lb />
			the petitioner trust, an application had been moved for recall of the
			<lb />
			above order. It was his assertion, that whether or not a recall order was
			<lb />
			passed with reference to the questions raised, it was apparent, that a
			<lb />
			Bench of this Court has already expressed the view, that the conclusions
			<lb />
			drawn in the Second and Third Judges cases, need a relook.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			37. Finally, to support the above suggestions, the Court&apos;s attention was
			<lb />
			drawn to the observations recorded by H.M. Seervai in the 4th edition of
			<lb />
			his book &quot;Constitutional Law of India&quot; wherein, with reference to the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case, very strong and adverse views were expressed. The
			<lb />
			aforesaid views are contained in paragraphs 25.448 to 25.497. For
			<lb />
			reasons of brevity, it is not possible for us to extract the same herein.
			<lb />
			Suffice it to state, that the submissions advanced by the learned Attorney
			<lb />
			General, as have been detailed in the foregoing paragraphs, were more or
			<lb />
			less, in accord with the views expressed by H.M. Seervai.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			38. In order to contend, that it was open to this Court, to make a
			<lb />
			reference for reconsideration of the matters already adjudicated upon,
			<lb />
			the learned Attorney General, invited our attention to Jindal Stainless
			<lb />
			Limited v. State of Haryana 16 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			6. In Keshav Mills Co. Ltd. v. CIT AIR 1965 SC 1636…(AIR pp.1643-44,
			<lb />
			para 23) a Constitution Bench of this Court enacted the circumstances in
			<lb />
			which a reference to the larger Bench would lie. It was held that in
			<lb />
			revisiting and revising its earlier decision, this Court should ask itself
			<lb />
			whether in the interest of the public good or for any other valid and
			<lb />
			compulsive reasons, it is necessary that the earlier decision should be
			<lb />
			revised? Whether on the earlier occasion, did some patent aspects of the
			<lb />
			question remain unnoticed, or was the attention of the Court not drawn
			<lb />
			to any relevant and material statutory provision, or was any previous
			<lb />
			decision bearing on the point not noticed? What was the impact of the
			<lb />
			error in the previous decision on public good? Has the earlier decision
			<lb />
			been followed on subsequent occasions either by this Court or by the
			<lb />
			High Courts? And, would the reversal of the earlier decision lead to
			<lb />
			public inconvenience, hardship or mischief?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			7. According to the judgment in Keshav Mills case these and other
			<lb />
			relevant considerations must be born in mind whenever this Court is
			<lb />
			called upon to exercise its jurisdiction to review and revisit its earlier
			<lb />
			decisions. Of course, in Keshav Mills case a caution was sounded to the
			<lb />
			effect that frequent exercise of this Court of its power to revisit its earlier
			<lb />
			decisions may incidentally tend to make the law uncertain and introduce
			<lb />
			confusion which must be avoided. But, that is not to say that if on a
			<lb />
			subsequent occasion, the Court is satisfied that its earlier decision was
			<lb />
			clearly erroneous, it should hesitate to correct the error.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			8. In conclusion, in Keshav Mills case, this Court observed that it is not
			<lb />
			possible to lay down any principles which should govern the approach of
			<lb />
			the Court in dealing with the question of revisiting its earlier decision. It
			<lb />
			would ultimately depend upon several relevant considerations.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			9. In Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community v. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra (2005) 2 SCC 673…, a Constitution Bench of this Court
			<lb />
			observed that, in case of doubt, a smaller Bench can invite attention of
			<lb />
			Chief Justice and request for the matter being placed for hearing before a
			<lb />
			Bench larger than the one whose decision is being doubted.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			39. With the above noted submissions, learned Attorney General for
			<lb />
			India concluded his address, for the review of the judgments in the
			<lb />
			Second and Third Judges cases.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			40. Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned senior counsel, commenced his
			<lb />
			submissions by highlighting the main features of the Constitution (67th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Bill, 1990. He invited our attention, to the proposed
			<lb />
			amendments of Articles 124, 217, 222 and 231, and more particularly, to
			<lb />
			the inserstion of Part XIIIA in the Constitution, under the heading
			<lb />
			&quot;National Judicial Commission&quot;. Article 307A was proposed as the
			<lb />
			singular Article in Part XIIIA. Based on the constitution of the National
			<lb />
			Judicial Commission, it was asserted, that the above Bill, had been
			<lb />
			introduced, to negate the effect of the judgment of this Court in the First
			<lb />
			Judges case. It was submitted, that when the aforesaid Bill was
			<lb />
			introduced in the Parliament, the Supreme Court Bar Association, of
			<lb />
			which Mr. Venugopal himself was the then President, organized a
			<lb />
			seminar on 1.9.1990, for the purpose of debating the pros and cons of
			<lb />
			the Constitution (67 th Amendment) Bill, 1990. It was submitted, that a
			<lb />
			large number of speakers had taken part in the debate and had made
			<lb />
			important suggestions. The above suggestions, drafted as a resolution of
			<lb />
			the seminar, were placed before the House, and were passed either
			<lb />
			unanimously or with an overwhelming majority. It was submitted, that
			<lb />
			the aforesaid resolutions were forwarded to the Chief Justice of India,
			<lb />
			through a covering letter dated 5.10.1990. It was pointed out, that
			<lb />
			resolutions were also passed, at the conclusion of the Chief Justices&apos;
			<lb />
			Conference, held between 31.8.1990 and 2.9.1990, wherein also, the
			<lb />
			provisions of the Constitution (67 th Amendment) Bill, 1990, were
			<lb />
			deliberated upon. It was submitted, that he had made a compilation of
			<lb />
			the resolutions passed at the Chief Justices Conference, and the
			<lb />
			conclusions drawn in the Second Judges case, which would give a bird&apos;s
			<lb />
			eye view, of the views expressed. The compilation to which learned
			<lb />
			counsel drew our attention, is being extracted hereunder:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;…(1) The process of appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court and
			<lb />
			the High Courts is an integrated &apos;participatory consultative process&apos; for
			<lb />
			selecting the best and most suitable persons available for appointment;
			<lb />
			and all the constitutional functionaries must perform this duty
			<lb />
			collectively with a view primarily to reach an agreed decision, subserving
			<lb />
			the constitutional purpose, so that the occasion of primacy does not
			<lb />
			arise.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(2) Initiation of the proposal for appointment in the case of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court must be by the Chief Justice of India, and in the case of a High
			<lb />
			Court by the Chief Justice of that High Court; and for transfer of a
			<lb />
			Judge/Chief Justice of a High Court, the proposal has to be initiated by
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India. This is the manner in which proposals for
			<lb />
			appointments to the Supreme Court and the High Courts as well as for
			<lb />
			the transfers of Judges/Chief Justices of the High Courts must invariably
			<lb />
			be made.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(3) In the event of conflicting opinions by the constitutional functionaries,
			<lb />
			the opinion of the judiciary &apos;symbolised by the view of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India&apos;, and formed in the manner indicated, has primacy.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(4) No appointment of any Judge to the Supreme Court or any High Court
			<lb />
			can be made, unless it is in conformity with the opinion of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(
		</p>
		<p>
			5) In exceptional cases alone, for stated strong cogent reasons, disclosed
			<lb />
			to the Chief Justice of India, indicating that the recommendee is not
			<lb />
			suitable for appointment, that appointment recommended by the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India may not be made. However, if the stated reasons are not
			<lb />
			accepted by the Chief Justice of India and the other Judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court who have been consulted in the matter, on reiteration of
			<lb />
			the recommendation by the Chief Justice of India, the appointment
			<lb />
			should be made as a healthy convention. …&quot;
			<lb />
			Based on the aforesaid compilation, it was contended, that the judgment
			<lb />
			rendered in the Second Judges case, completely obliterated three salient
			<lb />
			features of Article 124. Firstly, under the original Article 124, the main
			<lb />
			voice was that of the President. It was submitted, that the voice of the
			<lb />
			President was totally choked in the Second Judges case. Secondly, Article
			<lb />
			124, as it was originally framed, vested the executive with primacy, in
			<lb />
			respect of the appointments to the higher judiciary, whereas the position
			<lb />
			was reversed by the Second Judges case, by vesting primacy with the
			<lb />
			judiciary. Thirdly, the role of the Chief Justice of India, which was
			<lb />
			originally, that of a mere consultee, was &quot;turned over its head&quot;, by the
			<lb />
			decision in the Second Judges case. Now, the collegium of Judges,
			<lb />
			headed by the Chief Justice of India, has been vested with the final
			<lb />
			determinative authority for making appointments to the higher judiciary.
			<lb />
			And the President is liable to &quot;concur&quot;, with the recommendations made.
			<lb />
			Based on the above assertions, it was the submission of the learned
			<lb />
			counsel, that by wholly misconstruing Article 124, the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			had assumed the entire power of appointment. And the voice of the
			<lb />
			executive had been completely stifled. It was submitted, that the judiciary
			<lb />
			had performed a legislative function, while interpreting Article 124. It was
			<lb />
			asserted, that originally the founding fathers had the power to frame the
			<lb />
			provisions of the Constitution, and thereafter, the Parliament had the
			<lb />
			power to amend the Constitution in terms of Article 368. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the role assigned to the Constituent Assembly, as also to
			<lb />
			the Parliament, has been performed by this Court in the Second Judges
			<lb />
			case. It was submitted, that all this had been done in the name of
			<lb />
			&quot;judicial independence&quot;. The above logic was sought to be seriously
			<lb />
			contested by asserting, that judicial independence could not stand by
			<lb />
			itself, there was something like judicial accountability also, which had to
			<lb />
			be kept in mind.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			41. It was also contended, that the judiciary had taken upon itself, the
			<lb />
			exclusive role of making appointments to the higher judiciary, without
			<lb />
			taking into consideration any of the stakeholders. It is submitted, that
			<lb />
			the judiciary is meant for the litigating community, and therefore, the
			<lb />
			litigating community was liable to be vested with some role in the matter
			<lb />
			of appointments to the higher judiciary. Likewise, it was pointed out, that
			<lb />
			there were about ten lakhs lawyers in this country. They also had not
			<lb />
			been given any say in the matter. Even the Bar Associations, which have
			<lb />
			the ability to represent the lawyers&apos; fraternity, had been excluded from
			<lb />
			any role in the process of appointments. It was highlighted, that under
			<lb />
			the old system, all the above stakeholders, had an opportunity to make
			<lb />
			representations to the executive, in the matter of appointments to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary. But, that role has now been totally excluded, by the
			<lb />
			interpretation placed on Article 124, by the Second Judges case. The
			<lb />
			Court&apos;s attention was drawn to conclusion no.14 drawn in the summary
			<lb />
			of conclusions (recorded in paragraph 486, in the Second Judges case)
			<lb />
			that the majority opinion in the First Judges case, insofar as, it had
			<lb />
			taken a contrary view, relating to primacy of the role of the Chief Justice
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			of India, in matters of appointments and transfers, and the justiciability
			<lb />
			of these matters, as well as, in relation to judge-strength, did not
			<lb />
			commend itself as being the correct view. Accordingly it was concluded,
			<lb />
			that the relevant provisions of the Constitution including the
			<lb />
			constitutional scheme must now be construed, understood and
			<lb />
			implemented, in the manner indicated in the conclusions drawn in the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case. The above determination, according to learned
			<lb />
			counsel, was absolutely misconceived, as the same totally negated the
			<lb />
			effect of Article 74, which required the President to act only on the aid
			<lb />
			and advice of the Council of Ministers. According to learned counsel, the
			<lb />
			President would now have to act as per the dictate of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India and the collegium of Judges. It was submitted, that it was
			<lb />
			impermissible in law, for a party to make a decision in its own favour.
			<lb />
			This, according to learned counsel, is exactly what the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			had done in the Second Judges case. It was contented, that the
			<lb />
			impugned constitutional amendment was an effort at the behest of the
			<lb />
			Parliament, to correct the above historical aberration. Learned counsel
			<lb />
			concluded, by asserting, that there were two Houses of Parliament under
			<lb />
			the Constitution, but the Supreme Court in the Second Judges case, had
			<lb />
			acted as a third House of Parliament, namely, as the House of
			<lb />
			corrections. In the background of the aforesaid factual position, it was
			<lb />
			submitted, that when the Union of India and the States which ratified the
			<lb />
			Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, seek reconsideration of the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case, was it too much, that the Union and the States were asking
			<lb />
			for?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			42. Following the submissions noticed hereinabove, we heard Mr. K.
			<lb />
			Parasaran, Senior Advocate, who also supported the prayer made by the
			<lb />
			learned Attorney General. It was submitted, that the appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges had nothing to do with &quot;independence of the Judge&quot; concerned,
			<lb />
			or the judicial institution as a whole. It was submitted, that subsequent
			<lb />
			to their appointment to the higher judiciary, the conditions of service of
			<lb />
			Judges of the High Court and the Supreme Court were securely
			<lb />
			protected. Thereafter, the independence of the Judges depended on their
			<lb />
			judicial conscience, and the executive has no role to play therein.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			43. It was asserted, that the Judges who expressed the majority view,
			<lb />
			in the Second Judges case, entertained a preconceived notion about the
			<lb />
			&quot;basic structure&quot;, even before hearing commenced, in the Second Judges
			<lb />
			case. In this behalf, he placed reliance on the resolutions passed at the
			<lb />
			conclusion of the Chief Justices&apos; Conference, held between 31.8.1990 and
			<lb />
			2.9.1990. It was asserted, that the controversy had not been adjudicated
			<lb />
			on the basis of an independent assessment, of the views expressed in the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly debates (with reference to the text of Article 124).
			<lb />
			It was submitted, that the interpretation rendered on Article 124,
			<lb />
			expressly ignored, not only the simple language indicating the procedure
			<lb />
			for appointment of Judges, but also the surrounding constitutional
			<lb />
			provisions. According to learned senior counsel, the judiciary had
			<lb />
			encroached into the executive power of appointment of Judges. This
			<lb />
			amounted to encroaching into a constitutional power, reserved for the
			<lb />
			executive, by the Constitution. It was asserted, that the power of
			<lb />
			amendment of the Constitution, vested in the Parliament under Article
			<lb />
			368, was only aimed at keeping the Constitution in constant repair. It
			<lb />
			was submitted, that the aforesaid power vested with the Parliament,
			<lb />
			could not have been exercised by the Supreme Court, by substituting the
			<lb />
			procedure of appointment of Judges, in the manner the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			felt. It was submitted, that in the Second Judges case, as also, the Third
			<lb />
			Judges case, the Supreme Court had violated the &quot;basic structure&quot;, by
			<lb />
			impinging upon legislative power. It was contended, that it was
			<lb />
			imperative for this Court to have a re-look at the two judgments, so as to
			<lb />
			determine, whether there had been a trespass by the judiciary, into the
			<lb />
			legislative domain. And, if this Court arrives at the conclusion, that such
			<lb />
			was the case, it should strike down its earlier determination. It was
			<lb />
			further submitted, that the majesty of the Constitution, must be
			<lb />
			maintained and preserved at all costs, and there should be no hesitation
			<lb />
			in revisiting any earlier judgment, so as to correct an erroneous decision.
			<lb />
			With the aforesaid observations, learned counsel commended the Bench,
			<lb />
			to accept the prayer made by the learned Attorney General, and to make
			<lb />
			a reference for reconsideration of the judgments rendered by this Court,
			<lb />
			in the Second and Third Judges cases, to a Bench with an appropriate
			<lb />
			strength.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			44.
			<lb />
			Mr. Ravindra Srivastava, Senior Advocate, also supported the
			<lb />
			submissions for reference to a larger Bench. It was submitted, that the
			<lb />
			conclusions drawn by this Court in the Second Judges case, and the
			<lb />
			Third Judges case, were liable to be described as doubtful, because a
			<lb />
			large number of salient facts, had not been taken into consideration,
			<lb />
			when the same were decided. It was the contention of the learned
			<lb />
			counsel, that the submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners, on
			<lb />
			merits, could not be supported by the text of the constitutional
			<lb />
			provisions, and that, the petitioners&apos; reliance squarely based on the
			<lb />
			majority judgment in the Second Judges case, as was further explained
			<lb />
			in the Third Judges case, was seriously flawed. It was submitted, that
			<lb />
			the thrust of the submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners on
			<lb />
			merits had been, not only that the consultation with the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India was mandatory, but the opinion of the collegium of Judges was
			<lb />
			binding on the executive. It was asserted, that neither of the above
			<lb />
			requirements emerged from the plain reading of Article 124. It was
			<lb />
			asserted, that the basis of the learned counsel representing the
			<lb />
			petitioners, to assail the impugned constitutional amendment, as also the
			<lb />
			NJAC Act, was squarely premised on the above determination. It was
			<lb />
			asserted, that the conclusion of primacy of the judiciary, in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges in the higher judiciary, could not be supported by
			<lb />
			any text of the original constitutional provisions. It was, accordingly
			<lb />
			suggested, that it was absolutely imperative to correct the majority view
			<lb />
			expressed in the Second Judges case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			45. According to the learned counsel, the primary objection raised, at
			<lb />
			the behest of the petitioners, opposing the reconsideration of the decision
			<lb />
			rendered in the Second Judges case, was based on the observations
			<lb />
			recorded in paragraph 10 of the Third Judges case, wherein the
			<lb />
			statement of the then Attorney General for India, had been recorded, that
			<lb />
			the Union of India was not seeking a review or reconsideration of the
			<lb />
			judgment in the Second Judges case. It was submitted, that the aforesaid
			<lb />
			statement, could not bar the plea of reconsideration, for all times to
			<lb />
			come. It was further submitted, that the above statement would not bind
			<lb />
			the Parliament. It was contended, that the statement to the effect, that
			<lb />
			the Union of India, was not seeking a review or reconsideration of the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case, should not be understood to mean, that it was
			<lb />
			impliedly conceded, that the Second Judges case had been correctly
			<lb />
			decided. It was pointed out, that the advisory jurisdiction under Article
			<lb />
			143, which had been invoked by the Presidential Reference made on
			<lb />
			23.7.1998, requiring this Court to render the Third Judges case, was
			<lb />
			neither appellate nor revisionary in nature. In this behalf, learned
			<lb />
			counsel placed reliance on Re: Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal 17 ,
			<lb />
			wherein it was held, that an order passed by the Supreme Court, could
			<lb />
			be reviewed only when its jurisdiction was invoked under Article 137 of
			<lb />
			the Constitution (read with Rule 1 of Order 40 of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			Rules, 1946). And that, a review of the judgment rendered by the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court, in the Second Judges case, could not be sought through
			<lb />
			a Presidential Reference made under Article 143. In fact, this Court in
			<lb />
			the above judgment, had gone on to conclude, that if the power of review
			<lb />
			was to be read in Article 143, it would be a serious inroad into the
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. It was therefore submitted, that the
			<lb />
			statement of the then Attorney General, during the course of hearing of
			<lb />
			the Third Judges case, could not be treated as binding, for all times to
			<lb />
			come, so as to deprive the executive and the legislature from even seeking
			<lb />
			a review of the judgments rendered. It was therefore contended, that it
			<lb />
			was implicit while discharging its duty, that this Court was obliged to
			<lb />
			correct the errors of law, which may have been committed in the past.
			<lb />
			Learned counsel contended, that a perusal of the judgment of this Court
			<lb />
			in the Subhash Sharma case 4 , clearly brought out, that no formal request
			<lb />
			was made to this Court for reconsideration of the legal position declared
			<lb />
			by this Court in the First Judges case. Yet, this Court, on its own
			<lb />
			motion, examined the correctness of the First Judges case, and suo motu,
			<lb />
			made a reference of the matter, to a nine-Judge Bench, to reconsider the
			<lb />
			law declared in the First Judges case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			46. While pointing to the reasons for reconsideration of the law laid
			<lb />
			down by this Court in the Second Judges case (read with the Third
			<lb />
			Judges case), learned senior counsel, asserted, that the essence of Article
			<lb />
			124, had been completely ignored by the majority view. Learned senior
			<lb />
			counsel, accordingly, invited our attention to the scheme of Article 124(2)
			<lb />
			and canvassed and summarized the following salient features emerging
			<lb />
			therefrom:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;i.
			<lb />
			The authority to appoint Judges of the higher judiciary was vested
			<lb />
			in the President.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			ii.
			<lb />
			The above power of appointment by the President, was subject to
			<lb />
			only one condition, namely, &apos;consultation&apos;.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			iii.
			<lb />
			The above consultation was a two-fold -one which in the opinion of
			<lb />
			the President may be deemed necessary, and the other which was
			<lb />
			mandatory.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			iv.
			<lb />
			The mandatory consultation was with the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
			The consultation which the President may have &apos;if deemed necessary for
			<lb />
			the purpose, was with judges of the Supreme Court and also of the High
			<lb />
			Courts in the states, as may be felt appropriate.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			v.
			<lb />
			There was no limitation on the power, scope and ambit of the
			<lb />
			President to engage in consultation, he may not only with the judges of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court, but may also consult judges of High Courts as he
			<lb />
			may deem necessary, for this purpose.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			vi.
			<lb />
			There was also no limitation on the President&apos;s power of
			<lb />
			consultation. He could consult as many judges of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			and High Courts which he deemed necessary for the purpose.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			vii. Having regard to the object and purpose of the appointment of a
			<lb />
			judge of the Supreme Court, and that, such appointment was to the
			<lb />
			highest judicial office in the Republic, was clearly intended to be
			<lb />
			broad-based, interactive, informative and meaningful, so that, the
			<lb />
			appointment was made of the most suitable candidate.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			viii. This aspect of the power of consultation of the President, as had
			<lb />
			been provided had been completely ignored in the majority judgment in
			<lb />
			Second Judges&apos; case. And the focus has been confined only to the
			<lb />
			consultation, with the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />

			The interpretation of the consultative process, and the procedure
			<lb />
			laid down, in the majority judgement in the Second Judges case, that the
			<lb />
			President&apos;s power of consultation, was all-pervasive had been
			<lb />
			&apos;circumscribed&apos;, having been so held expressly in paragraph 458 (by
			<lb />
			Justice J.S. Verma) in the Second Judges&apos; case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			x.
			<lb />
			The majority judgment has focused only on the requirement of
			<lb />
			consultation by the President with the Chief Justice of India which is
			<lb />
			requirement of proviso, ignoring the substantive part.
			<lb />
			xi.
			<lb />
			The collegium system had been evolved, for consultation with the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India on the interpretation, that for purposes of
			<lb />
			consultation with the Chief Justice of India, the CJI alone as an
			<lb />
			individual would not matter, but would mean in plurality i.e. his
			<lb />
			collegium. But this is an interpretation only of the proviso and not of the
			<lb />
			substantive part of Article 124(2).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>

			<lb />
			The collegium system was evolved for consultation with the CJI and
			<lb />
			his colleagues in particular in fixed numbers as laid down in the
			<lb />
			judgment.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			xiii. The whole provision for consultation by the President of India with
			<lb />
			the judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court, had thus been
			<lb />
			stultified, in ignorance of the substantive part of Article 124(2), and as
			<lb />
			such, one was constrained to question the majority judgment as being
			<lb />
			&apos;per incuriam&apos;.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			47. According to learned senior counsel, a perusal of the judgment in
			<lb />
			the Subhash Sharma case 4 would reveal, that reconsideration of the
			<lb />
			judgments in the First Judges case, was only on two issues. Firstly, the
			<lb />
			status and importance of consultation, and the primacy of the position of
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India. And secondly, the justiceability of fixation, of
			<lb />
			the judge-strength of a Court. It was asserted, that no other issue was
			<lb />
			referred for reconsideration. This assertion was sought to be supported
			<lb />
			with the following observations, noticed in the Subhash Sharma case 4 :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;49. …..Similarly, the writ application filed by Subhash Sharma for the
			<lb />
			reasons indicated above may also be disposed of without further
			<lb />
			directions. As and when necessary the matter can be brought before the
			<lb />
			court. As in our opinion the correctness of the majority view in S.P.
			<lb />
			Gupta case [(1981) Supp. SCC 87] should be considered by a larger
			<lb />
			bench we direct the papers of W.P. No.1303 of 1987 to be placed before
			<lb />
			the learned Chief Justice for constituting a bench of nine Judges to
			<lb />
			examine the two questions we have referred to above, namely, the
			<lb />
			position of the Chief Justice of India with reference to primacy and,
			<lb />
			secondly, justiciability of fixation of Judge strength.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			It was asserted, that there was no scope or occasion for the Bench
			<lb />
			hearing the Second Judges case, to rewrite the Constitution, on the
			<lb />
			subject of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary.
			<lb />
			It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the observations recorded in the Second Judges case, in
			<lb />
			addition to the above mentioned two issues, were liable to be regarded as
			<lb />
			obiter dicta. In the Second Judges case, the ratio decidendi, according to
			<lb />
			learned counsel, was limited to the declaration of the legal position, only
			<lb />
			on the two issues, referred to the larger Bench for consideration. Thus
			<lb />
			viewed, it was asserted, that all other conclusions recorded in the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case, on issues other than the two questions referred for
			<lb />
			reconsideration, cannot legitimately be described as binding law under
			<lb />
			Article 141. To support the above contention, reliance was placed on
			<lb />
			Kerala State Science and Technology Museum v. Rambal Co. 18 , wherein
			<lb />
			this Court held as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;8. It is fairly well settled that when reference is made on a specific issue
			<lb />
			either by a learned Single Judge or Division Bench to a larger Bench i.e.
			<lb />
			Division Bench or Full Bench or Constitution Bench, as the case may be,
			<lb />
			the larger Bench cannot adjudicate upon an issue which is not the
			<lb />
			question referred to. (See Kesho Nath Khurana v. Union of India [(1981)
			<lb />
			Supp. SCC 38], Samaresh Chandra Bose v. District Magistrate, Burdwan
			<lb />
			[(1972) 2 SCC 476] and K.C.P. Ltd. v. State Trading Corpn. of India
			<lb />
			[(1995) Supp. (3) SCC 466].&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			48. Learned senior counsel submitted, that in the Second Judges case,
			<lb />
			this Court assigned an innovative meaning to the words &quot;Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India&quot;, by holding that the term &quot;Chief Justice of India&quot; in Article 124,
			<lb />
			included a plurality of Judges, and not the individual Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India. This, according to learned counsel, was against the plain meaning
			<lb />
			and text of Article 124. Learned counsel, went on to add, that this Court
			<lb />
			in the Second Judges case, had laid down an inviolable rule of seniority,
			<lb />
			for appointment of Chief Justice of India. It also laid down, the rules and
			<lb />
			the norms, for transfer of Judges and Chief Justices, from one High
			<lb />
			Court to another. It also concluded, that any transfer of a Judge or Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of a High Court, made on the recommendation of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, would be deemed to be non-punitive. In sum and
			<lb />
			substance, learned counsel contended, that the Second Judges case, laid
			<lb />
			down a new structure, in substitution to the role assigned to the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India. The conclusions recorded in the Second Judges case,
			<lb />
			according to learned counsel, could not be described as a mere judicial
			<lb />
			interpretation. It was asserted, that the same was nothing short of
			<lb />
			judicial activism (or, judicial legislation).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			49. Learned senior counsel then invited the Court&apos;s attention, to the
			<lb />
			principles laid down for reconsideration, or review of a previous
			<lb />
			judgment. For this he pointedly invited the Court&apos;s attention to Bengal
			<lb />
			Immunity Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar 19 , Maganlal Chhaganlal (P) Ltd. v.
			<lb />
			Municipal Corpn. of Greater Bombay 20 , and Union of India v. Raghubir
			<lb />
			Singh 21 . Learned counsel also referred to Pradeep Kumar Biswas v.
			<lb />
			Indian Institute of Chemical Biology 22 , wherein it was observed:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;61. Should Sabhajit Tewary (1975) 1 SCC 485 … still stand as an
			<lb />
			authority even on the facts merely because it has stood for 25 years? We
			<lb />
			think not. Parallels may be drawn even on the facts leading to an
			<lb />
			untenable interpretation of Article 12 and a consequential denial of the
			<lb />
			benefits of fundamental rights to individuals who would otherwise be
			<lb />
			entitled to them and
			<lb />
			&quot;[t]here is nothing in our Constitution which prevents us from departing
			<lb />
			from a previous decision if we are convinced of its error and its baneful
			<lb />
			effect on the general interests of the public.&quot; [Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. v.
			<lb />
			State of Bihar, AIR 1955 SC 661, 672] (AIR p. 672, para 15)
			<lb />
			Since on a re-examination of the question we have come to the
			<lb />
			conclusion that the decision was plainly erroneous, it is our duty to say
			<lb />
			so and not perpetuate our mistake.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			It was pointed out, that in the Second Judges case, S. Ratnavel Pandian,
			<lb />
			J. had observed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;17. So it falls upon the superior courts in a large measure the
			<lb />
			responsibility of exploring the ability and potential capacity of the
			<lb />
			Constitution with a proper diagnostic insight of a new legal concept and
			<lb />
			making this flexible instrument serve the needs of the people of this great
			<lb />
			nation without sacrificing its essential features and basic principles
			<lb />
			which lie at the root of Indian democracy. However, in this process, our
			<lb />
			main objective should be to make the Constitution quite understandable
			<lb />
			by stripping away the mystique and enigma that permeates and
			<lb />
			surrounds it and by clearly focussing on the reality of the working of the
			<lb />
			constitutional system and scheme so as to make the justice delivery
			<lb />
			system more effective and resilient. Although frequent overruling of
			<lb />
			decisions will make the law uncertain and later decisions unpredictable
			<lb />
			and this Court would not normally like to reopen the issues which are
			<lb />
			concluded, it is by now well settled by a line of judicial pronouncements
			<lb />
			that it is emphatically the province and essential duty of the superior
			<lb />
			courts to review or reconsider their earlier decisions, if so warranted
			<lb />
			under compelling circumstances and even to overrule any questionable
			<lb />
			decision, either fully or partly, if it had been erroneously held and that no
			<lb />
			decision enjoys absolute immunity from judicial review or reconsideration
			<lb />
			on a fresh outlook of the constitutional or legal interpretation and in the
			<lb />
			light of the development of innovative ideas, principles and perception
			<lb />
			grown along with the passage of time. This power squarely and directly
			<lb />
			falls within the rubric of judicial review or reconsideration.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			It was submitted, that Kuldip Singh, J., in the Second Judges case, had
			<lb />
			recorded as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;320. It is no doubt correct that the rule of stare decisis brings about
			<lb />
			consistency and uniformity but at the same time it is not inflexible.
			<lb />
			Whether it is to be followed in a given case or not is a question entirely
			<lb />
			within the discretion of this Court. On a number of occasions this Court
			<lb />
			has been called upon to reconsider a question already decided. The Court
			<lb />
			has in appropriate cases overruled its earlier decisions. The process of
			<lb />
			trial and error, lessons of experience and force of better reasoning make
			<lb />
			this Court wiser in its judicial functioning. In cases involving vital
			<lb />
			constitutional issues this Court must feel to bring its opinions into
			<lb />
			agreement with experience and with the facts newly ascertained. Stare
			<lb />
			decisis has less relevance in constitutional cases where, save for
			<lb />
			constitutional amendments, this Court is the only body able to make
			<lb />
			needed changes. Re-examination and reconsideration are among the
			<lb />
			normal processes of intelligent living. We have not refrained from
			<lb />
			reconsideration of a prior construction of the Constitution that has
			<lb />
			proved &quot;unsound in principle and unworkable in practice.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Based on the above, learned counsel summarized his assertions as
			<lb />
			follows.
			<lb />
			Firstly,
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			real
			<lb />
			constitutional
			<lb />
			question,
			<lb />
			requiring
			<lb />
			re-examination, was in the context of appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, was the interpretation of Article 74. Because the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case, had made a serious inroad into the power of the President
			<lb />
			which was bound to be exercised in consonance with Article 74. It was
			<lb />
			contended, that the functioning of the President, in the absence of the aid
			<lb />
			and advice of the Council of Ministers, could not just be imagined under
			<lb />
			the scheme of the Constitution. And therefore, the substitution of the
			<lb />
			participatory role of the Council of Ministers (or, the Minister concerned),
			<lb />
			with that of the Chief Justice of India in conjunction with his collegium,
			<lb />
			was just unthinkable. And secondly, that the First Judges case, was
			<lb />
			wrongly overruled, and the correct law for appointment of Judges,
			<lb />
			vis-à-vis the role of the executive, was correctly laid down in the First
			<lb />
			Judges case, by duly preserving the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. It
			<lb />
			was submitted, that reference to a larger Bench was inevitable, because it
			<lb />
			was not open to the respondents, to canvass the above submission,
			<lb />
			before a five-Judge Bench.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			50. Mr. Harish N. Salve and Mr. T.R. Andhyarujina, learned senior
			<lb />
			counsel, addressed the Court separately.
			<lb />
			Their submissions were
			<lb />
			however similar. It was their contention, that a Constitutional Court
			<lb />
			revisits constitutional issues, from time to time. This, according to
			<lb />
			learned counsel, has to be done because the Constitution is a living
			<lb />
			document, and needed to be reinvented, to keep pace with the change of
			<lb />
			times. It was submitted, that this may not be true for other branches of
			<lb />
			law, wherein judgments are not revisited, because the Courts were
			<lb />
			expected to clearly and unambiguously follow the principle of stare
			<lb />
			decisis, with reference to laws dealing with private rights. Insofar as the
			<lb />
			controversy in hand is concerned, it was submitted, that the conclusions
			<lb />
			recorded by this Court in the Second and Third Judges cases, indicated
			<lb />
			doubtful conclusions, because a large number of salient facts (as have
			<lb />
			been recorded above), had not been taken into consideration. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that expediency in a controversy like the one in hand, should
			<lb />
			be in favour of the growth of law. It was submitted, that in their view this
			<lb />
			was one such case, wherein the issue determined by this Court in the
			<lb />
			Second and Third Judges cases, needed to be re-examined by making a
			<lb />
			reference to a larger Bench. Learned counsel pointed out, that the
			<lb />
			submissions made in the different petitions filed before this Court, were
			<lb />
			not supported by the text of any constitutional provision, but only relied
			<lb />
			on the legal position declared by this Court, in the above two cases. In
			<lb />
			such an important controversy, according to learned counsel, this Court
			<lb />
			should not be hesitant in revisiting its earlier judgments. Mr.
			<lb />
			Andhyarujina posed a query, namely, can we decide the controversy
			<lb />
			raised in the present case, without the reconsideration of the judgments
			<lb />
			in the Second and Third Judges cases? He answered the same through
			<lb />
			another query, how can appointments of Judges be by Judges? The
			<lb />
			above position was again posed differently, by putting forth a further
			<lb />
			query, can primacy rest with the Chief Justice of India in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			51. Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha, learned Senior Advocate, in support of his
			<lb />
			contention, that the matter needed to be heard by a larger Bench, placed
			<lb />
			reliance on Mineral Area Development Authority v. Steel Authority of
			<lb />
			India 23 , and invited our attention to question no.5 of the reference made
			<lb />
			by this Court:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;5. Whether the majority decision in State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries
			<lb />
			Ltd. [(2004) 10 SCC 201] could be read as departing from the law laid
			<lb />
			down in the seven-Judge Bench decision in India Cement Ltd. v. State of
			<lb />
			T.N. [(1990) 1 SCC 12)?&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			It was pointed out, that the above question came to be framed because in
			<lb />
			State of West Bengal v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. 24 , this Court by a
			<lb />
			majority of 4:1 had clarified the judgment rendered by a seven-Judge
			<lb />
			Bench of this Court in India Cement Ltd. v. State of Tamil Nadu 25 . This
			<lb />
			Court had to frame the above question, and refer the matter to a
			<lb />
			nine-Judge Bench.
			<lb />
			Learned counsel, then placed reliance on
			<lb />
			Sub-Committee of Judicial Accountability v. Union of India 26 , wherein
			<lb />
			this Court had observed as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;5. Even if the prayer is examined as if it were an independent
			<lb />
			substantive proceeding, the tests apposite to such a situation would also
			<lb />
			not render the grant of this relief permissible. The considerations against
			<lb />
			grant of this prayer are obvious and compelling. Indeed, no co-ordinate
			<lb />
			bench of this Court can even comment upon, let alone sit in judgment
			<lb />
			over, the discretion exercised or judgment rendered in a cause or matter
			<lb />
			before another co-ordinate bench……&quot;
			<lb />
			In view of the above, it was contended, that this Court while examining
			<lb />
			the merits of the controversy in hand, was bound to rely on the
			<lb />
			judgments in the Second and Third Judges cases, to record its
			<lb />
			conclusions. Referring to the factual position narrated above, it was
			<lb />
			submitted, that this Court would not be in a position to effectively
			<lb />
			adjudicate on the issues canvassed, till the matter was referred to a
			<lb />
			nine-Judge Bench (or even, a still larger Bench).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			52. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned Solicitor General of India submitted, that
			<lb />
			he would support the claim for reference to a larger Bench, by relying
			<lb />
			upon two judgments, and say no more. First and foremost, he placed
			<lb />
			reliance on the Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. case 19 , which it was pointed
			<lb />
			out, had considered the judgment in State of Bombay v. United Motors
			<lb />
			(India) Ltd. 27 . The matter, it was submitted, came to be referred to a
			<lb />
			seven-Judge Bench, to decide whether the judgment needed to be
			<lb />
			reconsidered. This process, according to learned Solicitor General, need
			<lb />
			to be adopted in the present controversy as well, so as to take a fresh call
			<lb />
			on the previous judgments. Learned Solicitor General then placed
			<lb />
			reliance on Keshav Mills Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax,
			<lb />
			Bombay North 28 , wherein a seven-Judge Bench held as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;In dealing with the question as to whether the earlier decisions of this
			<lb />
			Court in the New Jehangir Mills case, (1960) 1 SCR 249 and the Petlad
			<lb />
			Co. Ltd. case, (1963) Supp. SCR 871, should be reconsidered and revised
			<lb />
			by us, we ought to be clear as to the approach which should be adopted
			<lb />
			in such cases. Mr. Palkhivala has not disputed the fact that, in a proper
			<lb />
			case, this Court has inherent jurisdiction to reconsider and revise its
			<lb />
			earlier decisions, and so, the abstract question as to whether such a
			<lb />
			power vests in this Court or not need not detain us. In exercising this
			<lb />
			inherent power, however, this would naturally like to impose certain
			<lb />
			reasonable limitations and would be reluctant to entertain pleas for the
			<lb />
			reconsideration and revision of its earlier decisions, unless it is satisfied
			<lb />
			that there are compelling and substantial reasons to do so. It is general
			<lb />
			judicial experience that in matters of law involving question of
			<lb />
			constructing statutory or constitutional provisions, two views are often
			<lb />
			reasonably possible and when judicial approach has to make a choice
			<lb />
			between the two reasonably possible views, the process of
			<lb />
			decision-making is often very difficult and delicate. When this Court
			<lb />
			hears appeals against decisions of the High Courts and is required to
			<lb />
			consider the propriety or correctness of the view taken by the High
			<lb />
			Courts on any point of law, it would be open to this Court to hold that
			<lb />
			though the view taken by the High Court is reasonably possible, the
			<lb />
			alternative view which is also reasonably possible is better and should be
			<lb />
			preferred. In such a case, the choice is between the view taken by the
			<lb />
			High Court whose judgment is under appeal, and the alternative view
			<lb />
			which appears to this Court to be more reasonable; and in accepting its
			<lb />
			own view in preference to that of the High Court, this Court would be
			<lb />
			discharging its duty as a Court of Appeal. But different considerations
			<lb />
			must inevitably arise where a previous decision of this Court has taken a
			<lb />
			particular view as to the construction of a statutory provision as, for
			<lb />
			instance, s. 66(4) of the Act. When it is urged that the view already taken
			<lb />
			by this Court should be reviewed and revised, it may not necessarily be
			<lb />
			an adequate reason for such review and revision to hold that though the
			<lb />
			earlier view is a reasonably possible view, the alternative view which is
			<lb />
			pressed on the subsequent occasion is more reasonable. In reviewing and
			<lb />
			revising its earlier decision, this Court should ask itself whether in
			<lb />
			interests of the public good or for any other valid and compulsive
			<lb />
			reasons, it is necessary that the earlier decision should be revised. When
			<lb />
			this Court decides questions of law, its decisions are, under Art. 141,
			<lb />
			binding on all courts within the territory of India, and so, it must be the
			<lb />
			constant endeavour and concern of this Court to introduce and maintain
			<lb />
			an element of certainty and continuity in the interpretation of law in the
			<lb />
			country. Frequent exercise by this Court of its power to review its earlier
			<lb />
			decisions on the ground that the view pressed before it later appears to
			<lb />
			the Court to be more reasonable, may incidentally tend to make law
			<lb />
			uncertain and introduce confusion which must be consistently avoided.
			<lb />
			That is not to say that if on a subsequent occasion, the Court is satisfied
			<lb />
			that its earlier decision was clearly erroneous, it should hesitate to
			<lb />
			correct the error; but before a previous decision is pronounced to be
			<lb />
			plainly erroneous, the Court must be satisfied with a fair amount of
			<lb />
			unanimity amongst its members that a revision of the said view is fully
			<lb />
			justified. It is not possible or desirable, and in any case it would be
			<lb />
			inexpedient to lay down any principles which should govern the approach
			<lb />
			of the Court in dealing with the question of reviewing and revising its
			<lb />
			earlier decisions. It would always depend upon several relevant
			<lb />
			considerations: -What is the nature of the infirmity or error on which a
			<lb />
			plea for a review and revision of the earlier view is based? On the earlier
			<lb />
			occasion, did some patent aspects of the question remain unnoticed, or
			<lb />
			was the attention of the Court not drawn to any relevant and material
			<lb />
			statutory provision, or was any previous decision of this Court bearing on
			<lb />
			the point not noticed? Is the Court hearing such plea fairly unanimous
			<lb />
			that there is such an error in the earlier view? What would be the impact
			<lb />
			of the error on the general administration of law or on public good? Has
			<lb />
			the earlier decision been followed on subsequent occasions either by this
			<lb />
			Court or by the High Courts? And, would the reversal of the earlier
			<lb />
			decision lead to public inconvenience, hardship or mischief? These and
			<lb />
			other relevant considerations must be carefully borne in mind whenever
			<lb />
			this Court is called upon to exercise its jurisdiction to review and review
			<lb />
			and revise its earlier decisions. These considerations become still more
			<lb />
			significant when the earlier decision happens to be a unanimous decision
			<lb />
			of a Bench of five learned Judges of this Court.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			….. The principle of stare decisis, no doubt, cannot be pressed into
			<lb />
			service in cases where the jurisdiction of this Court to reconsider and
			<lb />
			revise its earlier decisions is invoked; but nevertheless, the normal
			<lb />
			principle that judgments pronounced by this Court would be final,
			<lb />
			cannot be ignored, and unless considerations of a substantial and
			<lb />
			compelling character make it necessary to do so, this Court should and
			<lb />
			would be reluctant to review and revise its earlier decisions. That, broadly
			<lb />
			stated, is the approach which we propose to adopt in dealing with the
			<lb />
			point made by the learned Attorney-General that the earlier decisions of
			<lb />
			this Court in the New Jehangir Mills case, (1960) 1 SCR 249 and the
			<lb />
			Petlad Co. Ltd. case, (1963) Supp. 1 SCR 871, should be reconsidered
			<lb />
			and revised.
			<lb />
			Let us then consider the question of construing s.
		</item>
		<p>
			66(4) of the Act. Before
			<lb />
			we do so, it is necessary to read sub-section (1), (2) and (4) of s. 66.
			<lb />
			Section 66(1) reads thus: -
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Within sixty days of the date upon which he is served with notice of an
			<lb />
			order under sub-section (4) of section 33, the assessee or the
			<lb />
			Commissioner may, by application in the prescribed form, accompanied
			<lb />
			where application is made by the assessee by a fee of one hundred
			<lb />
			rupees, require the appellate Tribunal to refer to the High Court any
			<lb />
			question of law arising out of such order, and the Appellate Tribunal
			<lb />
			shall within ninety days of the receipt of such application draw up a
			<lb />
			statement of the case and refer it to the High Court.&quot; …..&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Based on the above, it was asserted, on the basis of the factual and legal
			<lb />
			position projected by the learned Attorney General, that the position
			<lb />
			declared by this Court in the Second Judges case, as also, in the Third
			<lb />
			Judges case, was clearly erroneous. It was submitted, that the procedure
			<lb />
			evolved by this Court for appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary
			<lb />
			having miserably failed, not because of any defect in the independence of
			<lb />
			the procedure prescribed, but because of the &quot;intra-dependence of the
			<lb />
			Judges&quot;, who took part in discharging the responsibilities vested in the
			<lb />
			collegium of Judges, certainly required a re-examination.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			53. It is apparent from the submissions advanced at the hands of the
			<lb />
			learned counsel representing the Union of India and the different State
			<lb />
			Governments, that rather than choosing to respond to the assertions
			<lb />
			made with reference to the constitutional validity of the Constitution
			<lb />
			(99th Amendment) Act, 2014 and the NJAC Act, had collectively
			<lb />
			canvassed, that the present five-Judge Bench should refer the present
			<lb />
			controversy for adjudication to a Bench of nine or more Judges, which
			<lb />
			could effectively revisit, if necessary, the judgments rendered by this
			<lb />
			Court in the Second and Third Judges cases. In view of the aforesaid
			<lb />
			consideration, we are of the view, that the observations recorded by this
			<lb />
			Court, in the Suraz India Trust case 15 , as also, the fact that the same is
			<lb />
			pending before this Court, is immaterial. Consequent upon the instant
			<lb />
			determination by us, the above matter will be liable to be disposed of, in
			<lb />
			terms of the instant judgment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			IV. OBJECTION BY THE PETITIONERS, TO THE MOTION FOR
			<lb />
			REVIEW:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			54. Mr. Fali S. Nariman, disagreed with the suggestion that the
			<lb />
			controversy in hand, needed to be decided by a larger Bench. It was his
			<lb />
			pointed submission, that the issue canvassed had been improperly
			<lb />
			pressed, by overlooking certain salient features, which had necessarily to
			<lb />
			be taken into consideration, before a prayer for reference to a larger
			<lb />
			Bench could be agitated. It was submitted, that all the learned counsel
			<lb />
			representing the respondents had overlooked the fact, that the
			<lb />
			interpretation of Article 124 of the Constitution, was rendered in the first
			<lb />
			instance, by a seven-Judge Bench in the First Judges case. It was
			<lb />
			pointed out, that the law declared by this Court in the First Judges case,
			<lb />
			having been doubted, the matter was referred for reconsideration, before
			<lb />
			the nine-Judge Bench, which delivered the judgment in the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case. It was pointed out, that the prayer for revisitation, which is
			<lb />
			being made at the behest of the learned counsel representing the Union
			<lb />
			of India and the different participating States, was clearly unacceptable,
			<lb />
			because the legal position declared by this Court in the First Judges case
			<lb />
			had already been revisited in the Second Judges case by a larger
			<lb />
			Constitution Bench. Not only that, it was asserted, that when certain
			<lb />
			doubts arose about the implementation of the judgment in the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case, a Presidential Reference was made under Article 143,
			<lb />
			resulting in the re-examination of the matter, at the hands of yet another
			<lb />
			nine-Judge Bench, where the Union of India clearly expressed its stand
			<lb />
			in paragraph 11 as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;11. We record at the outset the statements of the Attorney General that
			<lb />
			(1) the Union of India is not seeking a review or reconsideration of the
			<lb />
			judgment in the Second Judges case and that (2) the Union of India shall
			<lb />
			accept and treat as binding the answers of this Court to the questions set
			<lb />
			out in the Reference.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			It was submitted, that thereupon, the matter was again examined and
			<lb />
			the declared legal position in the Second Judges case, was reiterated and
			<lb />
			confirmed, by the judgment rendered in the Third Judges case. Premised
			<lb />
			on the aforesaid factual position, learned counsel raised a poser, namely,
			<lb />
			how many times, can this Court revisit the same question? It was
			<lb />
			asserted, that just because such a prayer seems to be the only way out,
			<lb />
			for those representing the respondents, the same need not be accepted.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			55. Learned senior counsel pointed out, that the legal position with
			<lb />
			reference to appointments to the higher judiciary came to be examined
			<lb />
			and declared, for the first time, in the First Judges case, in 1981. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the aforesaid determination would not have been
			<lb />
			rendered, had this Court&apos;s attention been drawn to the Samsher Singh
			<lb />
			case 11 , during the course of hearing, in the First Judges case. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the position declared by this Court in the First Judges
			<lb />
			case needed to be revisited, was realized during the hearing of the case in
			<lb />
			the Subhash Sharma case 4 . While examining the justification of the
			<lb />
			conclusions drawn by this Court, in the First Judges case, the matter
			<lb />
			was placed for consideration, before a nine-Judge Bench.
			<lb />
			It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that all the issues, which have now been raised at the hands
			<lb />
			of learned senior counsel representing the respondents, were canvassed
			<lb />
			before the Bench hearing the Second Judges case. This Court, in the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case, clearly arrived at the conclusion, that the earlier
			<lb />
			judgment rendered in the First Judges case, did not lay down the correct
			<lb />
			law. It was submitted, that the legal position had been declared in the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case, by a majority of 7:2.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			56. It was submitted, that the minority view, in the Second Judges
			<lb />
			case, was expressed by A.M. Ahmadi and M.M. Punchhi, JJ., (as they
			<lb />
			then were). Learned senior counsel, referred to the observations recorded
			<lb />
			in the Second Judges case by M.M. Punchhi, J.:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;500. Thus S.P. Gupta case, as I view it, in so far as it goes to permit the
			<lb />
			Executive
			<lb />
			trudging
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			express
			<lb />
			views
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			disapproval
			<lb />
			or
			<lb />
			non-recommendation made by the Chief Justice of India, and for that
			<lb />
			matter when appointing a High Court Judge the views of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of the High Court, is an act of impermissible deprival, violating
			<lb />
			the spirit of the Constitution, which cannot he approved, as it gives an
			<lb />
			unjust and unwarranted additional power to the Executive, not originally
			<lb />
			conceived of. Resting of such power with the Executive would be wholly
			<lb />
			inappropriate and in the nature of arbitrary power. The constitutional
			<lb />
			provisions conceives, as it does, plurality and mutuality, but only
			<lb />
			amongst the constitutional functionaries and not at all in the
			<lb />
			extra-constitutional ones in replacement of the legitimate ones. The two
			<lb />
			functionaries can be likened to the children of the cradle, intimately
			<lb />
			connected to their common mother -the Constitution. They recognise
			<lb />
			each other through that connection. There is thus more an obligation
			<lb />
			towards the tree which bore the fruit rather than to the fruit directly.
			<lb />
			Watering the fruit alone is pointless ignoring the roots of the tree. The
			<lb />
			view that the two functionaries must keep distances from each other is
			<lb />
			counter-productive. The relationship between the two needs to be
			<lb />
			maintained with more consideration.

			503. A centuries old Baconian example given to describe the plight of a
			<lb />
			litigant coming to a court of law comes to my mind. It was described that
			<lb />
			when the sheep ran for shelter to the bush to save itself from rain and
			<lb />
			hail, it found itself deprived of its fleece when coming out. Same fate for
			<lb />
			the institution of the Chief Justice of India. Here it results simply and
			<lb />
			purely in change of dominance. In the post -S.P. Gupta period, the
			<lb />
			Central Government i.e. the Law Minister and the Prime Minister were
			<lb />
			found to be in a dominant position and could even appoint a Judge in the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary despite his being disapproved or not recommended by
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India and likewise by the Chief Justice of a State
			<lb />
			High Court. Exception perhaps could be made only when the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice was not emphatic of his disapproval and was non-committed. His
			<lb />
			stance could in certain circumstance be then treated, as implied consent.
			<lb />
			These would of course be rare cases. Now in place of the aforesaid two
			<lb />
			executive heads come in dominant position, the first and the second
			<lb />
			puisne, even when disagreeing with the Chief Justice of India. A similar
			<lb />
			position would emerge when appointing a Chief Justice or a Judge of the
			<lb />
			High Court. Thus in my considered view the position of the institution of
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice being singular and unique in character under the
			<lb />
			Constitution is not capable of being disturbed. It escaped S.P. Gupta
			<lb />
			case, though in a truncated form, and not to have become totally extinct,
			<lb />
			as is being done now. Correction was required in that regard in S.P.
			<lb />
			Gupta, but not effacement.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Pointing to the opinion extracted above, it was asserted, that the action of
			<lb />
			the executive to put off the recommendation made by the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India (disapproving the appointment of a person, as a Judge of the High
			<lb />
			Court) would amount to an act of deprival, &quot;violating the sprit of the
			<lb />
			Constitution&quot;. Inasmuch as, the above demeanour/expression, would
			<lb />
			give an unjust and unwarranted power to the executive, which was not
			<lb />
			intended by the framers of the Constitution. The Court went on to hold,
			<lb />
			that the vesting of such power with the executive, would be wholly
			<lb />
			inappropriate, and in the nature of arbitrary power. It was also noted,
			<lb />
			that after this Court rendered its decision in the First Judges case, the
			<lb />
			Law Minister and the Prime Minister were found to be in such a
			<lb />
			dominant position, that they could appoint a Judge to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, despite his being disapproved (or, even when he was not
			<lb />
			recommended at all) by the Chief Justice of India (and likewise, by the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of the High Court). Thus, in the view of M.M. Punchhi, J.,
			<lb />
			these details had escaped the notice of the authors of the First Judges
			<lb />
			case, and corrections were required, in that regard, in the said judgment.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, it was the contention of the learned senior counsel, that one
			<lb />
			of the minority Judges had also expressed the same sentiments as had
			<lb />
			been recorded by the majority, on the subject of primacy of the judiciary
			<lb />
			in matters regulated under Articles 124, 217 and 222.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			57. It was submitted, that the issue in hand was examined threadbare
			<lb />
			by revisiting the judgment rendered in the First Judges case, when this
			<lb />
			Court reviewed the matter through the Second Judges case. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that during the determination of the Third Judges case, the
			<lb />
			then Attorney General for India had made a statement to the Bench, that
			<lb />
			the Union of India, was not seeking a review or reconsideration of the
			<lb />
			judgment in the Second Judges case. Even though, the opinion tendered
			<lb />
			by this Court, consequent upon a reference made to the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			by the President of India under Article 143, is not binding, yet a
			<lb />
			statement was made by Attorney General for India, that the Union of
			<lb />
			India had accepted as binding, the answers of this Court to the questions
			<lb />
			set out in the reference. All this, according to learned counsel, stands
			<lb />
			recorded in paragraph 11 of the judgment rendered in the Third Judges
			<lb />
			case. According to learned senior counsel, it was clearly beyond the
			<lb />
			purview of the Union of India, to seek a revisit of the Second and Third
			<lb />
			Judges cases.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			58. Besides the position expressed in the foregoing paragraphs, even
			<lb />
			according to the legal position declared by this Court, it was not open to
			<lb />
			the Union of India and the State Governments, to require this Court to
			<lb />
			examine the correctness of the judgments rendered in the Second and
			<lb />
			Third Judges cases. It was submitted, that such a course could only be
			<lb />
			adopted, when it was established beyond all reasonable doubt, that the
			<lb />
			previous judgments were erroneous. Insofar as the instant aspect of the
			<lb />
			matter is concerned, learned counsel placed reliance on Lt. Col. Khajoor
			<lb />
			Singh v. Union of India 29 (Bench of 7 Judges), wherefrom learned
			<lb />
			counsel highlighted the following:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;We have given our earnest consideration to the language of Art. 226 and
			<lb />
			the two decisions of this Court referred to above. We are of opinion that
			<lb />
			unless there are clear and compelling reasons, which cannot be denied,
			<lb />
			we should not depart from the interpretation given in these two cases
			<lb />
			and indeed from any interpretation given in an earlier judgment of this
			<lb />
			Court, unless there is a fair amount of unanimity that the earlier
			<lb />
			decisions are manifestly wrong. This Court should not, except when it is
			<lb />
			demonstrated beyond all reasonable doubt that its previous ruling, given
			<lb />
			after due deliberation and full hearing, was erroneous, go back upon its
			<lb />
			previous ruling, particularly on a constitutional issue.&quot;
			<lb />
			Reference was also made to the Keshav Mills Co. Ltd. case 28 , wherein a
			<lb />
			seven-Judge Bench of this Court held as under:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;It must be conceded that the view for which the learned
			<lb />
			Attorney-General contends is a reasonably possible view, though we
			<lb />
			must hasten to add that the view which has been taken by this Court in
			<lb />
			its earlier decisions is also reasonably possible. The said earlier view has
			<lb />
			been followed by this Court on several occasions and has regulated the
			<lb />
			procedure in reference proceedings in the High Courts in this country
			<lb />
			ever since the decision of this Court in the New Jehangir Mills, (1960) 1
			<lb />
			SCR 249, was pronounced on May 12, 1959. Besides, it is somewhat
			<lb />
			remarkable that no reported decision has been cited before us where the
			<lb />
			question about the construction of s. 66(4) was considered and decided
			<lb />
			in favour of the Attorney-General&apos;s contention. Having carefully weighed
			<lb />
			the pros and cons of the controversy which have been pressed before us
			<lb />
			on the present occasion, we are not satisfied that a case has been made
			<lb />
			out to review and revise our decisions in the case of the New Jehangir
			<lb />
			Mills and the case of the Petlad Co. Ltd. (1963) Supp. 1 SCR 871. That is
			<lb />
			why we think that the contention raised by Mr. Palkhivala must be
			<lb />
			upheld. In the result, the order passed by the High Court is set aside and
			<lb />
			the matter is sent back to the High Court with a direction that the High
			<lb />
			Court should deal with it in the light of the two relevant decisions in the
			<lb />
			New Jehangir Mills and the Petlad Co. Ltd.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			While referring to Ganga Sugar Corporation Ltd. v. State of Uttar
			<lb />
			Pradesh 30 , our attention was drawn to the following observations
			<lb />
			recorded by the five-Judge Bench:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;28. We are somewhat surprised that the argument about the invalidity
			<lb />
			of the Act on the score that it is with respect to a controlled industry&apos; dies
			<lb />
			hard, despite the lethal decision of this Court in Ch. Tika Ramji
			<lb />
			case [1956] SCR 393. Enlightened litigative policy in the country must
			<lb />
			accept as final the pronouncements of this Court by a Constitution
			<lb />
			Bench unless the subject be of such fundamental importance to national
			<lb />
			life or the reasoning is so plainly erroneous in the light of later thought
			<lb />
			that it is wiser to be ultimately right rather than to be consistently
			<lb />
			wrong. Stare decisis is not a ritual of convenience but a rule with limited
			<lb />
			exceptions, Pronouncements by Constitution Benches should not be
			<lb />
			treated so cavalierly as to be revised frequently. We cannot devalue the
			<lb />
			decisions of this Court to brief ephemerality which recalls the opinion
			<lb />
			expressed by Justice Roberts of the U.S. Supreme Court in Smith v.
			<lb />
			Allwright 321 U.S. 649 at 669 (1944) &quot;that adjudications of the Court
			<lb />
			were rapidly gravitating &apos;into the same class as a restricted railroad
			<lb />
			ticket, good for this day and train only&apos;&quot;.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Learned counsel while relying upon Gannon Dunkerley and Co. v. State
			<lb />
			of Rajasthan 31 (Bench of 5 Judges), referred to the following:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;28. …..We are not inclined to agree. The principles governing
			<lb />
			reconsideration of an earlier decision are settled by the various decisions
			<lb />
			of this Court. It has been laid down: &quot;This Court should not, accept when
			<lb />
			it is demonstrated beyond all reasonable doubt that its previous ruling,
			<lb />
			given after due deliberation and full hearing, was erroneous, go back
			<lb />
			upon its previous ruling, particularly on a constitutional issue.&quot; (See: Lt.
			<lb />
			Col. Khajoor Singh vs. The Union of India, (1961) 2 SCR 828). In Keshav
			<lb />
			Mills Co. Ltd. vs. CIT, (1965) 2 SCR 908, it has been observed: (SCR pp.
			<lb />
			921-22)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;…..but before a previous decision is pronounced to be plainly erroneous,
			<lb />
			the Court must be satisfied with a fair amount of unanimity amongst its
			<lb />
			members that a revision of the said view is fully justified.&quot;
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			30. Having regard to the observations referred to above and the stand of
			<lb />
			the parties during the course of arguments before us, we do not consider
			<lb />
			it appropriate to reopen the issues which are covered by the decision in
			<lb />
			Builders&apos; Association case….&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Having referred to the above judgments, it was submitted, that it was
			<lb />
			clearly misconceived for the learned counsel for the respondents, to seek
			<lb />
			a reference of the controversy, to a larger Bench for the re-examination of
			<lb />
			the decisions rendered by this Court in the Second and Third Judges
			<lb />
			cases.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			59. Yet another basis for asserting, that the prayer made at the behest
			<lb />
			of the learned counsel representing the respondents for revisiting the
			<lb />
			judgments rendered by this Court in the Second and Third Judges cases,
			<lb />
			was canvassed on the ground that the observations recorded by this
			<lb />
			Court in the Samsher Singh case 11 (in paragraph 149) could neither be
			<lb />
			understood as stray observations, nor be treated as obiter dicta. The
			<lb />
			reasons expressed by the learned senior counsel on the above issue were
			<lb />
			as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;(i) In the other case relating to the independence of the judiciary (re
			<lb />
			transfer of High Court Judges) -UOI vs. Sankal Chand Seth, (1977) 4
			<lb />
			SCC 193 (5J) -as to whether a Judge of a High Court can be transferred
			<lb />
			to another High Court without his consent, it was decided by majority
			<lb />
			that he could be: the majority consisted of Justice Chandrachud, Justice
			<lb />
			Krishna Iyer and Justice Murtaza Fazal Ali.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii) The judgment of Justice Krishna Iyer (on behalf of himself and Justice
			<lb />
			Murtaza Fazal Ali in Sankal Chand Seth -[with which Bhagwati, J. said
			<lb />
			he was &quot;entirely in agreement&quot;] reads as follows (paras 115-116):
			<lb />
			&quot;115. The next point for consideration in this appeal is as to the nature,
			<lb />
			ambit and scope of consultation, as appearing in Article 222(1) of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, with the Chief Justice of India. The consultation, in order to
			<lb />
			fulfil its normative function in Article 222(1), must be a real, substantial
			<lb />
			and effective consultation based on full and proper materials placed
			<lb />
			before the Chief Justice by the Government. Before giving his opinion the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India would naturally take into consideration all relevant
			<lb />
			factors and may informally ascertain from the Judge concerned if he has
			<lb />
			any real personal difficulty or any humanitarian ground on which his
			<lb />
			transfer may not be directed. Such grounds may be of a wide range
			<lb />
			including his health or extreme family factors. It is not necessary for the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice to issue formal notice to the Judge concerned but it is
			<lb />
			sufficient -although it is not obligatory -if he ascertains these facts
			<lb />
			either from the Chief Justice of the High Court or from his own
			<lb />
			colleagues or through any other means which the Chief Justice thinks
			<lb />
			safe, fair and reasonable. Where a proposal of transfer of a Judge is made
			<lb />
			the Government must forward every possible material to the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			so that he is in a position to give an effective opinion. Secondly, although
			<lb />
			the opinion of the Chief Justice of India may not be binding on the
			<lb />
			Government it is entitled to great weight and is normally to be accepted
			<lb />
			by the Government because the power under Article 222 cannot be
			<lb />
			exercised whimsically or arbitrarily. In the case of Chandramouleshwar
			<lb />
			Prasad v. Patna High Court, (1969) 3 SCC 36, while interpreting the word
			<lb />
			&quot;consultation&quot; as appearing in Article 233 of the Constitution this Court
			<lb />
			observed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Consultation with the High Court under Article 233 is not an empty
			<lb />
			formality. So far as promotion of officers to the cadre of District Judges is
			<lb />
			concerned the High Court is best fitted to adjudge the claims and merits
			<lb />
			of persons to be considered for promotion....We cannot accept this.
			<lb />
			Consultation or deliberation is not complete or effective before the parties
			<lb />
			thereto make their respective points of view known to the other or others
			<lb />
			and discuss and examine the relative merits of their views. If one party
			<lb />
			makes a proposal to the other who has a counter proposal in his mind
			<lb />
			which is not communicated to the prosper the direction to give effect to
			<lb />
			the counter proposal without anything more, cannot be said to have been
			<lb />
			issued after consultation.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			In Samsher Singh&apos;s case, AIR 1974 SC 2192, one of us has struck the
			<lb />
			same chord. It must also be borne in mind that if the Government
			<lb />
			departs from the opinion of the Chief Justice of India it has to justify its
			<lb />
			action by giving cogent and convincing reasons for the same and, if
			<lb />
			challenged, to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that a case was made
			<lb />
			out for not accepting the advice of the Chief Justice of India. It seems to
			<lb />
			us that the word, &apos;consultation&apos; has been used in Article 222 as a matter
			<lb />
			of constitutional courtesy in view of the fact that two very high dignitaries
			<lb />
			are concerned in the matter, namely, the President and the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India. Of course, the Chief Justice has no power of veto, as Dr.
			<lb />
			Ambedkar explained in the Constituent Assembly.&quot;
			<lb />
			(iii) Justice Chandrachud (in the course of his judgment) agreeing -in
			<lb />
			paragraph 41 of Sankalchand Seth followed Shamsher Singh (para 149).&quot;
			<lb />
			Based on the aforesaid, it was the assertion of the learned senior counsel
			<lb />
			that even if the contention advanced by the counsel for the respondents
			<lb />
			was to be accepted, namely, that the decisions rendered by this Court in
			<lb />
			the above two cases were required to be re-examined, by a reference to a
			<lb />
			larger Bench, still the observations recorded in paragraph 149 in the
			<lb />
			Samsher Singh case 11 would continue to hold the field, as the review of
			<lb />
			the same had not been sought.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			V.
			<lb />
			THE CONSIDERATION:
			<lb />
			I.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			60. In the scheme of the Constitution, the Union judiciary has been
			<lb />
			dealt in Chapter IV of Part V, and the High Courts in the States, as well
			<lb />
			as, the Subordinate-courts have been dealt with in Chapters V and VI
			<lb />
			respectively, of Part VI. The provisions of Parts V and VI of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, with reference to the Union and the States judiciaries
			<lb />
			including
			<lb />
			Subordinate-courts,
			<lb />
			have
			<lb />
			arisen
			<lb />
			for
			<lb />
			interpretative
			<lb />
			determination by this Court, on several occasions. We may
			<lb />
			chronologically notice the determination rendered by this Court, with
			<lb />
			reference to the above Parts, especially those dealing with the executive
			<lb />
			participation, in the matters relating to the Union judiciary, the High
			<lb />
			Courts in the States, and the Subordinate-courts. During the course of
			<lb />
			hearing, our attention was invited to the following:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(i) Samsher Singh v. State of Punjab, (1974) 2 SCC 831 -rendered
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			This Court on no less than five occasions, has examined the controversy
			<lb />
			which we are presently dealing with, through Constitution Benches. In
			<lb />
			the Samsher Singh case 11 , it was concluded, that in all conceivable cases,
			<lb />
			consultation with the highest dignitary in the Indian judiciary -the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, will and should be accepted by the Government of India,
			<lb />
			in matters relatable to the Chapters and Parts of the Constitution
			<lb />
			referred to above. In case, it was not so accepted, the Court would have
			<lb />
			an opportunity to examine, whether any other extraneous circumstances
			<lb />
			had entered into the verdict of the concerned Minister or the Council of
			<lb />
			Ministers (headed by the Prime Minister), whose views had prevailed in
			<lb />
			ignoring the counsel given by the Chief Justice of India. This Court
			<lb />
			accordingly concluded, that in practice, the last word must belong to the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India. The above position was also further clarified, that
			<lb />
			rejection of the advice tendered by the Chief Justice of India, would
			<lb />
			ordinarily be regarded as prompted by oblique considerations, vitiating
			<lb />
			the order. In a sense of understanding, this Court in the Samsher Singh
			<lb />
			case 11 , is seen to have read the term &quot;consultation&quot; expressed in Articles
			<lb />
			124 and 217 as conferring primacy to the opinion tendered by the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice. When the matter came to be examined in the Sankalchand
			<lb />
			Himatlal Sheth case 5 , with reference to Article 222, another Constitution
			<lb />
			Bench of this Court, reiterated the conclusion drawn in the Samsher
			<lb />
			Singh case 11 , by holding, that in all conceivable cases, &quot;consultation&quot; with
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India, should be accepted, by the Government of
			<lb />
			India. And further, that in the event of any departure, it would be open
			<lb />
			to a court to examine whether, any other circumstances had entered into
			<lb />
			the verdict of the executive. More importantly, this Court expressly
			<lb />
			recorded an ardent hope, that the exposition recorded in the Samsher
			<lb />
			Singh case 11 , would not fall on deaf ears. No doubt can be entertained,
			<lb />
			that yet again, this Court read the term &quot;consultation&quot; as an expression,
			<lb />
			conveying primacy in the matter under consideration, to the view
			<lb />
			expressed by the Chief Justice. The solitary departure from the above
			<lb />
			interpretation, was recorded by this Court in the First Judges case,
			<lb />
			wherein it came to be concluded, that the meaning of the term
			<lb />
			&quot;consultation&quot; could not be understood as &quot;concurrence&quot;. In other words,
			<lb />
			it was held, that the opinion tendered by the Chief Justice of India, would
			<lb />
			not be binding on the executive. The function of appointment of Judges
			<lb />
			to the higher judiciary, was described as an executive function, and it
			<lb />
			was held by the majority, that the ultimate power of appointment,
			<lb />
			unquestionably rested with the President. The opinion expressed by this
			<lb />
			Court in the First Judges case, was doubted in the Subhash Sharma
			<lb />
			case 4 , which led to the matter being re-examined in the Second Judges
			<lb />
			case, at the hands of a nine-Judge Bench, which while setting aside the
			<lb />
			judgment rendered in the First Judges case, expressed its opinion in
			<lb />
			consonance with the judgments rendered in the Samsher Singh case 11
			<lb />
			and the Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth case 5 . This Court expressly
			<lb />
			concluded, in the Second Judges case, that the term &quot;consultation&quot;
			<lb />
			expressed in Articles 124, 217 and 222 had to be read as vesting primacy
			<lb />
			with the opinion expressed by the Chief Justice of India, based on a
			<lb />
			participatory consultative process. In other words, in matters involving
			<lb />
			Articles 124, 217 and 222, primacy with reference to the ultimate power
			<lb />
			of appointment (or transfer) was held, to be vesting with the judiciary.
			<lb />
			The above position came to be reconsidered in the Third Judges case, by
			<lb />
			a nine-Judge Bench, wherein the then learned Attorney General for India,
			<lb />
			made a statement, that the Union of India was not seeking a review, or
			<lb />
			reconsideration of the judgment in the Second Judges case, and further,
			<lb />
			that the Union of India had accepted the said judgment, and would treat
			<lb />
			the decision of this Court in the Second Judges case as binding. It is
			<lb />
			therefore apparent, that the judiciary would have primacy in matters
			<lb />
			regulated by Articles 124, 217 and 222, was conceded, by the Union of
			<lb />
			India, in the Third Judges case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			61. We have also delineated hereinabove, the views of the Judges
			<lb />
			recorded in the First Judges case, which was rendered by a majority of
			<lb />
			4:3. Not only, that the margin was extremely narrow, but also, the views
			<lb />
			expressed by the Judges were at substantial variance, on all the issues
			<lb />
			canvassed before the Court. The primary reason for recording the view of
			<lb />
			each of the Judges in the First Judges case hereinbefore, was to
			<lb />
			demonstrate differences in the deductions, inferences and the eventual
			<lb />
			outcome. As against the above, on a reconsideration of the matters by a
			<lb />
			larger Bench in the Second Judges case, the decision was rendered by a
			<lb />
			majority of 7:2. Not only was the position clearly expressed, there was
			<lb />
			hardly any variance, on the issues canvassed. So was the position with
			<lb />
			the Third Judges case, which was a unanimous and unambiguous
			<lb />
			exposition of the controversy. We, therefore, find ourselves not inclined to
			<lb />
			accept the prayer for a review of the Second and Third Judges cases.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			62. Having given pointed and thoughtful consideration to the
			<lb />
			proposition canvassed at the hands of the learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			respondents, we are constrained to conclude, that the issue of primacy of
			<lb />
			the judiciary, in the matter of appointment and transfer of Judges of the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, having been repeatedly examined, the prayer for a
			<lb />
			re-look/reconsideration of the same, is just not made out. This Court
			<lb />
			having already devoted so much time to the same issue, should ordinarily
			<lb />
			not agree to re-examine the matter yet again, and spend more time for an
			<lb />
			issue, already well thrashed out. But time has not been the constraint,
			<lb />
			while hearing the present cases, for we have allowed a free debate, and
			<lb />
			have taken upon ourselves the task of examining the issues canvassed.
			<lb />
			Yet, the remedy of review must have some limitations. Mr. Fali S.
			<lb />
			Nariman, learned senior counsel, is right, in his submission, that the
			<lb />
			power of review was exercised and stood expended when the First Judges
			<lb />
			case was reviewed by a larger Bench in the Second Judges case. And for
			<lb />
			sure, it was wholly unjustified for the Union of India, which had
			<lb />
			conceded during the course of hearing of the Third Judges case, that it
			<lb />
			had accepted as binding, the decision rendered in the Second Judges
			<lb />
			case, to try and reagitate the matter all over again. The matter having
			<lb />
			been revisited, and the position having been conceded by the Union of
			<lb />
			India, it does not lie in the mouth of the Union of India, to seek
			<lb />
			reconsideration of the judicial declaration, in the Second and Third
			<lb />
			Judges cases. Therefore, as a proposition of law, we are not inclined to
			<lb />
			accept the prayer of the Union of India and the other respondents, for a
			<lb />
			re-look or review of the judgments rendered in the Second and Third
			<lb />
			Judges cases. All the same, as we have indicated at the beginning of this
			<lb />
			order, because the matter is of extreme importance and sensitivity, we
			<lb />
			will still examine the merits of the submissions advanced by learned
			<lb />
			counsel.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			II.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			63. The most forceful submission advanced by the learned Attorney
			<lb />
			General, was premised on the Constituent Assembly debates. In this
			<lb />
			behalf, our attention was invited to the views expressed by K.T. Shah,
			<lb />
			K.M.
			<lb />
			Munshi,
			<lb />
			Tajamul
			<lb />
			Husain,
			<lb />
			Alladi Krishnaswami
			<lb />
			Aayar,
			<lb />
			Ananthasayanam Ayyangar and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. It was pointed out
			<lb />
			by the learned Attorney General, that the Members of the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly feared, that the process of selection and appointment of Judges
			<lb />
			to the higher judiciary should not be exclusively vested with the
			<lb />
			judiciary. The process of appointment of Judges by Judges, it was
			<lb />
			contended, was described as Imperium in Imperio, during the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly debates. In responding to the above observations, Dr. B.R.
			<lb />
			Ambedkar while referring to the contents of Article 122 (which was
			<lb />
			renumbered as Article 124 in the Constitution), had assured the
			<lb />
			Members of the Constituent Assembly, that the drafted Article had
			<lb />
			adopted the middle course, while refusing to create an Imperium in
			<lb />
			Imperio, in such a manner, that the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;
			<lb />
			would be fully preserved. The exact text of the response of Dr. B.R.
			<lb />
			Ambedkar, has been extracted in paragraph 30 above.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			64. It was the contention of the learned Attorney General, that despite
			<lb />
			the clear intent expressed during the Constituent Assembly debates, not
			<lb />
			to create an Imperium in Imperio, the Second and Third Judges cases had
			<lb />
			done just that. It was submitted, that in the process of selection and
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, being followed since 1993,
			<lb />
			Judges alone had been appointing Judges. It was also contended, that
			<lb />
			the Constitution contemplates a system of checks and balances, where
			<lb />
			each pillar of governance is controlled by checks and balances, exercised
			<lb />
			by the other two pillars. It was repeatedly emphasized, that in the present
			<lb />
			system of selection and appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary,
			<lb />
			the executive has no role whatsoever. It was accordingly the contention of
			<lb />
			the respondents, that the manner in which Articles 124, 217 and 222
			<lb />
			had been interpreted in the Second and Third Judges cases, fell foul of
			<lb />
			the intent of the Constituent Assembly. This, according to the learned
			<lb />
			counsel for the respondents, was reason enough, to revisit and correct,
			<lb />
			the view expressed in the Second and Third Judges cases.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			65. It is not possible for us to accept the contention advanced at the
			<lb />
			hands of the learned counsel for the respondents. Consequent upon the
			<lb />
			pronouncement of the judgments in the Second and Third Judges cases,
			<lb />
			a Memorandum of Procedure for Appointment of Judges and Chief
			<lb />
			Justices to the Higher Judiciary was drawn by the Ministry of Law,
			<lb />
			Justice and Company Affairs on 30.6.1999.
			<lb />
			The Memorandum of
			<lb />
			Procedure aforementioned, is available on the website of the above
			<lb />
			Ministry. The above Memorandum of Procedure has been examined by
			<lb />
			us. In our considered view, the Memorandum of Procedure provides for a
			<lb />
			participatory role, to the judiciary as well as the political-executive. Each
			<lb />
			of the above components are responsible for contributing information,
			<lb />
			material and data, with reference to the individual under consideration.
			<lb />
			While the judicial contribution is responsible for evaluating the
			<lb />
			individual&apos;s professional ability, the political-executive is tasked with the
			<lb />
			obligation to provide details about the individual&apos;s character and
			<lb />
			antecedents. Our analysis of the Memorandum of Procedure reveals,
			<lb />
			that the same contemplates inter alia the following steps for selection of
			<lb />
			High Court Judges:
			<lb />
			Step 1:
			<lb />
			The Chief Justice of the concerned High Court has the
			<lb />
			responsibility of communicating, to the Chief Minister of the State
			<lb />
			concerned, names of persons to be selected for appointment. Details are
			<lb />
			furnished to the Chief Minister, in terms of the format appended to the
			<lb />
			memorandum. Additionally, if the Chief Minister desires to recommend
			<lb />
			name(s) of person(s) for such appointment, he must forward the same to
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice for his consideration.
			<lb />
			Step 2:
			<lb />
			Before forwarding his recommendations to the Chief Minister,
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice must consult his senior colleagues comprised in the
			<lb />
			High Court collegium, regarding the suitability of the names proposed.
			<lb />
			The entire consultation must be in writing, and these opinions must be
			<lb />
			sent to the Chief Minister along with the Chief Justice&apos;s recommendation.
			<lb />
			Step 3:
			<lb />
			Copies of recommendations made by the Chief Justice of the
			<lb />
			High Court, to the Chief Minister of the concerned State, require to be
			<lb />
			endorsed, to the Union Minister of Law and Justice, to the Governor of
			<lb />
			the concerned State, and to the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
			Step 4:
			<lb />
			Consequent upon the consideration of the names proposed by
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice, the Governor of the concerned State, as advised by the
			<lb />
			Chief Minister, would forward his recommendation along with the entire
			<lb />
			set of papers, to the Union Minister for Law and Justice.
			<lb />
			Step 5:
			<lb />
			The Union Minister for Law and Justice would, at his own,
			<lb />
			consider the recommendations placed before him, in the light of the
			<lb />
			reports, as may be available to the Government, in respect of the names
			<lb />
			under consideration. The proposed names, would be subject to scrutiny
			<lb />
			at the hands of the Intelligence Bureau, through the Union Ministry of
			<lb />
			Home Affairs. The Intelligence Bureau would opine on the integrity of the
			<lb />
			individuals under consideration.
			<lb />
			Step 6:
			<lb />
			The entire material, as is available with the Union Minister for
			<lb />
			Law and Justice, would then be forwarded to the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			for his advice. The Chief Justice of India would, in consultation with his
			<lb />
			senior colleagues comprised in the Supreme Court collegium, form his
			<lb />
			opinion with regard to the persons recommended for appointment.
			<lb />
			Step 7:
			<lb />
			Based on the material made available, and additionally the
			<lb />
			views of Judges of the Supreme Court (who were conversant with the
			<lb />
			affairs of the concerned High Court), the Chief Justice of India in
			<lb />
			consultation with his collegium of Judges, would forward his
			<lb />
			recommendation, to the Union Minister for Law and Justice. The above
			<lb />
			noted views of Judges of the Supreme Court, conversant with the affairs
			<lb />
			of the High Court, were to be obtained in writing, and are to be part of
			<lb />
			the compilation incorporating the recommendation.
			<lb />
			Step 8:
			<lb />
			The Union Minister for Law and Justice would then put up
			<lb />
			the recommendation made by the Chief Justice of India, to the Prime
			<lb />
			Minister, who would examine the entire matter in consultation with the
			<lb />
			Union Minister for Law and Justice, and advise the President, in the
			<lb />
			matter of the proposed appointments.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			66. We shall venture to delineate the actual consideration at the hands
			<lb />
			of the executive, in the process of selection and appointment of High
			<lb />
			Court Judges, in terms of the Memorandum of Procedure, as well as, the
			<lb />
			actual prevailing practice.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			67. Steps 1 to 3 of the Memorandum of Procedure reveal, that names of
			<lb />
			persons to be selected for appointment are forwarded to the Chief
			<lb />
			Minister and the Governor of the concerned State. On receipt of the
			<lb />
			names, the Chief Minister discharges the onerous responsibility to
			<lb />
			determine the suitability of the recommended candidate(s). Specially the
			<lb />
			suitability of the candidate(s), pertaining to integrity, social behaviour,
			<lb />
			political involvement and the like. Needless to mention, that the Chief
			<lb />
			Minister of the concerned State, has adequate machinery for providing
			<lb />
			such inputs. It would also be relevant to mention, that the consideration
			<lb />
			at the hands of the Governor of the concerned State, is also not an empty
			<lb />
			formality. For it is the Governor, through whom the file processed by the
			<lb />
			Chief Minister, is forwarded to the Union Minister for Law and Justice.
			<lb />
			There have been occasions, when Governors of the concerned State, have
			<lb />
			recorded their own impressions on the suitability of a recommended
			<lb />
			candidate, in sharp contrast with the opinion expressed by the Chief
			<lb />
			Minister. Whether or not the Governors participate in the above exercise,
			<lb />
			is quite a separate matter. All that needs to be recorded is, that there are
			<lb />
			instances where Governors have actively participated in the process of
			<lb />
			selection of Judges to High Courts, by providing necessary inputs.
			<lb />
			Record also bears testimony to the fact, that the opinion expressed by the
			<lb />
			Governor, had finally prevailed on a few occasions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			68. The participation of the executive, with reference to the
			<lb />
			consideration of a candidate recommended by the Chief Justice of High
			<lb />
			Court, continues further at the level of the Government of India. The
			<lb />
			matter of suitability of a candidate, is also independently examined at
			<lb />
			the hands of the Union of Minister for Law and Justice. The Ministry of
			<lb />
			Law and Justice has a standard procedure of seeking inputs through the
			<lb />
			Union Ministry of Home Affairs. Such inputs are made available by the
			<lb />
			Union Ministry for Home Affairs, by having the integrity, social
			<lb />
			behaviour, political involvement and the like, examined through the
			<lb />
			Intelligence Bureau. After the receipt of such inputs, and the
			<lb />
			examination of the proposal at the hands of the Union Minister for Law
			<lb />
			and Justice, the file proceeds to the Chief Justice of India, along with the
			<lb />
			details received from the quarters referred to above.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			69. After the Chief Justice of India, in consultation with his collegium
			<lb />
			of Judges recommends the concerned candidate for elevation to the High
			<lb />
			Court, the file is processed for a third time, by the executive. On this
			<lb />
			occasion, at the level of the Prime Minister of India. During the course of
			<lb />
			the instant consideration also, the participation of the executive is not an
			<lb />
			empty formality. Based on the inputs available to the Prime Minister, it
			<lb />
			is open to the executive, to yet again return the file to the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, for a reconsideration of the proposal, by enclosing material which
			<lb />
			may have escaped the notice of the Chief Justice of India and his
			<lb />
			collegium of Judges. There have been occasions, when the file returned
			<lb />
			to the Chief Justice of India for reconsideration, has resulted in a
			<lb />
			revision of the view earlier taken, by the Chief Justice of India and his
			<lb />
			collegium of Judges. It is therefore clear, that there is a complete comity
			<lb />
			of purpose between the judiciary and the political-executive in the matter
			<lb />
			of selection and appointment of High Court Judges. And between them,
			<lb />
			there is clear transparency also. As views are exchanged in writing, views
			<lb />
			and counter-views, are in black and white. Nothing happens secretly,
			<lb />
			without the knowledge of the participating constitutional functionaries.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			70. It is not necessary for us to delineate the participation of the
			<lb />
			judiciary in the process of selection and appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			High Courts. The same is apparent from the steps contemplated in the
			<lb />
			Memorandum of Procedure, as have been recorded above. Suffice it to
			<lb />
			state, that it does not lie in the mouth of the respondents to contend,
			<lb />
			that there is no executive participation in the process of selection and
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to High Courts.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			71. The Memorandum of Procedure, for selection of Supreme Court
			<lb />
			Judges, provides for a similar participatory role to the judiciary and the
			<lb />
			political-executive. The same is not being analysed herein, for reasons of
			<lb />
			brevity. Suffice it to state, that the same is also a joint exercise, with a
			<lb />
			similar approach.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			72. For the reasons recorded by us hereinabove, it is not possible for
			<lb />
			us to accept, that in the procedure contemplated under the Second and
			<lb />
			Third Judges cases, Judges at their own select Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, or that, the system of Imperium in Imperio has been created for
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary. It is also not possible for
			<lb />
			us to accept, that the judgment in the Second Judges case, has
			<lb />
			interfered with the process of selection and appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, by curtailing the participatory role of the executive, in
			<lb />
			the constitutional scheme of checks and balances, in view of the role of
			<lb />
			the executive fully described above. We find no merit in the instant
			<lb />
			contention advanced at the hands of the respondents.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			III.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			73. The learned Attorney General placed emphatic reliance on the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly debates. It was sought to be asserted, that for an
			<lb />
			apposite understanding of the provisions of the Constitution, it was
			<lb />
			imperative to refer to the Constituent Assembly debates, which had led to
			<lb />
			formulating and composing of the concerned Article(s). Reliance was
			<lb />
			accordingly placed on the debates, which had led to the drafting of Article
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			124. It was submitted, that the conclusions drawn by this Court, in the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case, overlooked the fact, that what had been expressly
			<lb />
			canvassed and raised by various Members of the Constituent Assembly,
			<lb />
			and rejected on due consideration, had been adopted by the judgment in
			<lb />
			the Second Judges case. It was, therefore, the contention of the learned
			<lb />
			Attorney General, that the judgments rendered in the Second and Third
			<lb />
			Judges cases recorded a view, diagonally opposite the intent and resolve
			<lb />
			of the Constituent Assembly.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			74. For reasons of brevity, it is not essential for us to extract herein the
			<lb />
			amendments sought by some of the eminent Members of the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly in the draft provision (to which our attention was drawn). At
			<lb />
			this stage, we need only to refer to paragraph 772 (already extracted
			<lb />
			above), from the Indra Sawhney case 9 , in order to record, that it is not
			<lb />
			essential to refer to individual views of the Members, and that, the view
			<lb />
			expressed at the end of the debate by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, would be
			<lb />
			sufficient to understand what had prevailed, and why. Suffice it to state,
			<lb />
			that during the course of the Constituent Assembly debates, it was
			<lb />
			expressly proposed that the term &quot;consultation&quot; engaged in Articles 124
			<lb />
			and 217, be substituted by the word &quot;concurrence&quot;. The proposed
			<lb />
			amendment was however rejected by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. Despite the
			<lb />
			above, this Court in the Second and Third Judges cases had interpreted
			<lb />
			the word &quot;consultation&quot; in clause (2) of Article 124, and clause (1) of
			<lb />
			Article 217, as vesting primacy in the judiciary, something that was
			<lb />
			expressly rejected, during the Constituent Assembly debate.
			<lb />
			And
			<lb />
			therefore, the contention advanced on behalf of the respondents was,
			<lb />
			that this Court had interpreted the above provisions, by turning the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly&apos;s intent and resolve, on its head. It was submitted,
			<lb />
			that the erroneous interpretation recorded in the Second Judges case,
			<lb />
			was writ large, even on a cursory examination of the debates.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			75. We are of the view, that it would suffice, for examining the above
			<lb />
			contention, to extract herein a relevant part of the response of Dr. B.R.
			<lb />
			Ambedkar, to the above noted amendments, in the provisions noted
			<lb />
			above:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Now, Sir, with regard to the numerous amendments that have been
			<lb />
			moved, to this article, there are really three issues that have been raised.
			<lb />
			The first is, how are the Judges of the Supreme Court to be appointed?
			<lb />
			Now, grouping the different amendments which are related to this
			<lb />
			particular matter, I find three different proposals. The first proposal is
			<lb />
			that the Judges of the Supreme Court should be appointed with the
			<lb />
			concurrence of the Chief Justice. That is one view. The other view is that
			<lb />
			the appointments made by the President should be subject to the
			<lb />
			confirmation of two-thirds vote by Parliament; and the third suggestion is
			<lb />
			that they should be appointed in consultation with the Council of States.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			With regard to this matter, I quite agree that the point raised is of the
			<lb />
			greatest importance. There can be no difference of opinion in the House
			<lb />
			that our judiciary must both be independent of the executive and must
			<lb />
			also be competent in itself. And the question is how these two objects
			<lb />
			could be secured. There are two different ways in which this matter is
			<lb />
			governed in other countries. In Great Britain the appointments are made
			<lb />
			by the Crown, without any kind of limitation whatsoever, which means
			<lb />
			by the executive of the day. There is the opposite system in the United
			<lb />
			States where, for instance, offices of the Supreme Court as well as other
			<lb />
			offices of the State shall be made only with the concurrence of the Senate
			<lb />
			in the United States. It seems to me, in the circumstances in which we
			<lb />
			live today, where the sense of responsibility has not grown to the same
			<lb />
			extent to which we find it in the United States, it would be dangerous to
			<lb />
			leave the appointments to be made by the President, without any kind of
			<lb />
			reservation or limitation, that is to say, merely on the advice of the
			<lb />
			executive of the day. Similarly, it seems to me that to make every
			<lb />
			appointment which the executive wishes to make subject to the
			<lb />
			concurrence of the Legislature is also not a very suitable provision. Apart
			<lb />
			from its being cumbrous, it also involves the possibility of the
			<lb />
			appointment being influenced by political pressure and political
			<lb />
			considerations. The draft article, therefore, steers a middle course. It
			<lb />
			does not make the President the supreme and the absolute authority in
			<lb />
			the matter of making appointments. It does not also import the influence
			<lb />
			of the Legislature. The provision in the article is that there should be
			<lb />
			consultation of persons who are ex hypothesi, well qualified to give
			<lb />
			proper advice in matters of this sort, and my judgment is that this sort of
			<lb />
			provision may be regarded as sufficient for the moment.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			With
		</item>
		<note type="other">
			regard to the question of the concurrence of the Chief Justice, it
			<lb />
			seems to me that those who advocate that proposition seem to rely
			<lb />
			implicitly both on the impartiality of the Chief Justice and the soundness
			<lb />
			of his judgment. I personally feel no doubt that
		</note>
		<p>
			the Chief Justice is a very
			<lb />
			eminent, person. But after all the Chief Justice is a man with all the
			<lb />
			failings, all the sentiments and all the prejudices which we as common
			<lb />
			people have; and I think, to allow the Chief Justice practically a veto
			<lb />
			upon the appointment of judges is really to transfer the authority to the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice which we are not prepared to vest in the President or the
			<lb />
			Government of the day. I therefore, think that that is also a dangerous
			<lb />
			proposition.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			The first paragraph extracted hereinabove reveals, that there were three
			<lb />
			proposals on the issue of appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court.
			<lb />
			The first proposal was, that the Judges of the Supreme Court should not
			<lb />
			be appointed by the President in &quot;consultation&quot; with the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, but should be appointed with the &quot;concurrence&quot; of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India. The second proposal was, that like in the United States,
			<lb />
			appointments of Judges to the Supreme Court, should be made by the
			<lb />
			President, subject to confirmation by the Parliament, through a
			<lb />
			two-thirds majority. The third proposal was, that Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court, should be appointed by the President in &quot;consultation&quot; with the
			<lb />
			Rajya Sabha.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			76. The response of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar to all the suggestions needs a
			<lb />
			very close examination, inasmuch as, even though rightfully pointed out
			<lb />
			by the Attorney General, and the learned counsel representing the
			<lb />
			respondents, all the issues which arise for consideration in the present
			<lb />
			controversy, were touched upon in the above response. Before dwelling
			<lb />
			upon the issue, which strictly pertained to the appointment of Judges,
			<lb />
			Dr. B.R. Ambedkar expressed in unequivocal terms, that the unanimous
			<lb />
			opinion of the Constituent Assembly was, that &quot;our judiciary must be
			<lb />
			independent of the executive&quot;. The same sentiment was expressed by Dr.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			B.R. Ambedkar while responding to K.T. Shah, K.M. Munshi, Tajamul
			<lb />
			Husain, Alladi Krishnaswami Aayar and Anathasayanam Ayyangar
			<lb />
			(extracted in paragraph 30 above) wherein he emphasized, that &quot;…there
			<lb />
			is no doubt that the House in general, has agreed that the independence
			<lb />
			of the Judiciary, from the Executive should be made as clear and definite
			<lb />
			as we could make it by law…&quot; The above assertion made while debating
			<lb />
			the issue of appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court, effectively
			<lb />
			acknowledges, that the appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary,
			<lb />
			has a direct nexus to the issue of &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. It
			<lb />
			therefore, does not lie in the mouth of the respondents to assert, that the
			<lb />
			subject of &quot;appointment&quot; would not fall within the domain/realm of
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			77. While responding to the second and third proposals referred to
			<lb />
			above, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, cited the manner of appointment of Judges in
			<lb />
			Great Britain, and pointed out, that in the United Kingdom appointments
			<lb />
			were made by the Crown, without any kind of limitation, and as such,
			<lb />
			fell within the exclusive domain of the executive. Referring to the system
			<lb />
			adopted in the United States, he noted, that Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in the United States, could only be appointed with the
			<lb />
			&quot;concurrence&quot; of the Senate. Suffice it to state, that the latter reference
			<lb />
			was to a process of appointment which fell within the domain of the
			<lb />
			legislature (because the Senate is a legislative chamber in the bicameral
			<lb />
			legislature of the United States, which together with the U.S. House of
			<lb />
			Representatives, make up the U.S. Congress). It is important to notice,
			<lb />
			that he rejected both the systems, where appointments to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary were made by the executive, as well as, by the legislature. Dr.
			<lb />
			B.R. Ambedkar therefore, very clearly concluded the issue by expressing,
			<lb />
			that it would be improper to leave the appointments of Judges to the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court, to be made by the President -the executive (i.e., on the
			<lb />
			aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister).
			<lb />
			In the words of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, it would be dangerous to leave such
			<lb />
			appointments in the hands of the executive of the day, without any kind
			<lb />
			of reservation and limitation. We are therefore satisfied, that the word
			<lb />
			&quot;consultation&quot; expressed in Articles 124 and 217, was contemplated by
			<lb />
			the Constituent Assembly, to curtail the free will of the executive. If that
			<lb />
			was the true intent, the word &quot;consultation&quot; could never be assigned its
			<lb />
			ordinary dictionary meaning. And Article 124 (or Article 217) could never
			<lb />
			be meant to be read with Article 74. It is therefore not possible for us to
			<lb />
			accept, that the main voice in the matter of selection and appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges to the higher judiciary was that of the President (expressed in the
			<lb />
			manner contemplated under Article 74). Nor is it possible to accept that
			<lb />
			primacy in the instant matter rested with the executive. Nor that, the
			<lb />
			judiciary has been assigned a role in the matter, which was not
			<lb />
			contemplated by the provisions of the Constitution. It is misconceived for
			<lb />
			the respondents to assert, that the determination of this Court in the
			<lb />
			Second and Third Judges cases was not interpretative in nature, but was
			<lb />
			factually legislative. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, therefore rejected, for the same
			<lb />
			reasons, the proposal that appointments of Judges to the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			should be made by the legislature. But the reason he expressed in this
			<lb />
			behalf was most apt, namely, the procedure of appointing Judges, by
			<lb />
			seeking a vote of approval by one or the other (or both) House(s) of
			<lb />
			Parliament would be cumbersome. More importantly, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar
			<lb />
			was suspicious and distrustful of the possibility of the appointments
			<lb />
			being directed and impacted by &quot;political pressure&quot; and &quot;political
			<lb />
			consideration&quot;, if the legislature was involved. We are therefore satisfied,
			<lb />
			that when the Constituent Assembly used the term &quot;consultation&quot;, in the
			<lb />
			above provisions, its intent was to limit the participatory role of the
			<lb />
			political-executive in the matter of appointments of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			78. It was the view of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, that the draft article had
			<lb />
			adopted a middle course, by not making the President -the executive
			<lb />
			&quot;the supreme and absolute authority in the matter of making
			<lb />
			appointments&quot; of Judges. And also, by keeping out the legislators for
			<lb />
			their obvious political inclinations and biases, which render them
			<lb />
			unsuitable for shouldering the responsibility. We are therefore of the
			<lb />
			view, that the judgments in the Second and Third Judges cases cannot
			<lb />
			be blamed, for not assigning a dictionary meaning to the term
			<lb />
			&quot;consultation&quot;. If the real purpose sought to be achieved by the term
			<lb />
			&quot;consultation&quot; was to shield the selection and appointment of Judges to
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary, from executive and political involvement, certainly
			<lb />
			the term &quot;consultation&quot; was meant to be understood as something more
			<lb />
			than a mere &quot;consultation&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			79. It is clear from the observations of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, that the
			<lb />
			President -the executive was required by the provisions of the draft
			<lb />
			article, to consult &quot;…persons, who were ex hypothesi, well qualified to
			<lb />
			give proper advice on the matter of appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court.&quot; The response of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar in a singular
			<lb />
			paragraph (extracted above), leaves no room for any doubt that Article
			<lb />
			124, in the manner it was debated, was clearly meant to propound, that
			<lb />
			the matter of &quot;appointments of Judges was an integral part of the
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. The process contemplated for
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges, would therefore have to be understood, to be
			<lb />
			such, as would be guarded/shielded from political pressure and political
			<lb />
			considerations.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			80. The paragraph following the one, that has been interpreted in the
			<lb />
			foregoing paragraphs, also leaves no room for any doubt, that the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly did not desire to confer the Chief Justice of India,
			<lb />
			with a veto power to make appointments of Judges. It is therefore that a
			<lb />
			consultative process was contemplated under Article 124, as it was
			<lb />
			originally drafted. The same mandated consultation not only with the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India, but with other Judges of the Supreme Court and
			<lb />
			the High Courts. Viewed closely, the judgments in the Second and Third
			<lb />
			Judges cases, were rendered in a manner as would give complete effect
			<lb />
			to the observations made by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar with reference to Article
			<lb />
			124 (as originally incorporated). It is clearly erroneous for the
			<lb />
			respondents to contend, that the consultative process postulated
			<lb />
			between the President with the other Judges of the Supreme Court or the
			<lb />
			High Courts in the States, at the discretion of the President, had been
			<lb />
			done away with by the Second and Third Judges cases. Nothing of the
			<lb />
			sort. It has been, and is still open to the President, in his unfettered
			<lb />
			wisdom, to the consultation indicated in Article 124. Additionally, it is
			<lb />
			open to the President, to rely on the same, during the course of the
			<lb />
			mandatory &quot;consultation&quot; with the Chief Justice of India. The above,
			<lb />
			further demonstrates the executive role in the selection of Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, quite contrary to the submission advanced on behalf of
			<lb />
			the respondents. We are satisfied, that the entire discussion and logic
			<lb />
			expressed during the debates of the Constituent Assembly, could be
			<lb />
			given effect to, by reading the term &quot;consultation&quot; as vesting primacy
			<lb />
			with the judiciary, on the matter being debated. We are also of the view,
			<lb />
			that the above debates support the conclusions drawn in the judgments
			<lb />
			of which review is being sought. For the reasons recorded hereinabove,
			<lb />
			we find no merit in the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for
			<lb />
			the respondents based on the Constituent Assembly debates.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			IV.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			81. The consideration in hand, also has a historic perspective. We
			<lb />
			would venture to examine the same, from experiences gained, after the
			<lb />
			Constitution became operational i.e., after the people of this country
			<lb />
			came to govern themselves, in terms of the defined lines, and the
			<lb />
			distinctiveness of functioning, set forth by the arrangement and
			<lb />
			allocation of responsibilities, expressed in the Constitution. In this
			<lb />
			behalf, it would be relevant to highlight the discussion which took place
			<lb />
			in Parliament, when the Fourteenth Report of the Law Commission on
			<lb />
			Judicial Reform (1958) was tabled for discussion, in the Rajya Sabha on
			<lb />
			24-25.11.1959. Replying to the debate on 24.11.1959, Govind Ballabh
			<lb />
			Pant, the then Union Home Minister&apos;s remarks, as stand officially
			<lb />
			recorded, were inter alia as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Sir, so far as appointments to the Supreme Court go, since 1950 when
			<lb />
			the Constitution was brought into force, nineteen Judges have been
			<lb />
			appointed and everyone of them was so appointed on the
			<lb />
			recommendation of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. I do not
			<lb />
			know if any other alternative can be devised for this purpose. The Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of the Supreme Court is, I think, rightly deemed and believed to
			<lb />
			be familiar with the merits of his own colleagues and also of the Judges
			<lb />
			and advocates who hold leading positions in different States. So we have
			<lb />
			followed the advice of the most competent, dependable and eminent
			<lb />
			person who could guide us in this matter.
			<lb />
			Similarly, Sir, so far as High Courts are concerned, since 1950, 211
			<lb />
			appointments have been made and out of these except one, i.e., 210 out
			<lb />
			of 211 were made on the advice, with the consent and concurrence of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India. And out of the 211, 196 proposals which were
			<lb />
			accepted by Government had the support of all persons who were
			<lb />
			connected with this matter. As Hon. Members are aware, under, I think,
			<lb />
			article 217, the Chief Justice of the High Court; the Chief Minister of the
			<lb />
			State concerned and the Governor first deal with these matters. Then
			<lb />
			they come to the Home Ministry and are referred by the Ministry to the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India and whatever suggestions or comments he makes
			<lb />
			are taken into consideration and if necessary, a reference is again made
			<lb />
			to the Chief Minister and the High Court. But as I said, these 196
			<lb />
			appointments were made in accordance with the unanimous advice of
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of the High Court, the Chief Minister of the State, the
			<lb />
			Governor and the Chief Justice of India…&quot;
			<lb />
			The remarks made by Ashoke Kumar Sen, the then Union Law Minister
			<lb />
			on 25.11.1959, during the course of the debate pertaining to the Law
			<lb />
			Commission Report, also need a reference:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;.....it is my duty to point out to the honourable House again, as I did in
			<lb />
			the Lok Sabha when the Law Commission first sent an interim report -
			<lb />
			call it an interim report or some report before the final one -pointing out
			<lb />
			that Judges have been appointed on extraneous considerations, we gave
			<lb />
			them the facts and figures concerning all the appointments made since
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			1950. We drew their pointed attention to the fact that, as the Home
			<lb />
			Minister pointed out yesterday, except in the case of one Judge out of the
			<lb />
			176 odd Judges appointed since 1950, all were appointed on the advice
			<lb />
			of the Chief Justice. With regard to the one there was difference of
			<lb />
			opinion between the local Chief Justice and the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			and the Government accepted the advice of the local Chief Justice rather
			<lb />
			than the Chief Justice of India. But it was not their nominee. We should
			<lb />
			have expected the Law Commission, in all fairness, to have dealt with the
			<lb />
			communication from the Government giving facts of all the appointments
			<lb />
			not only of the High Courts but of the Supreme Court. I am not saying
			<lb />
			that they were obliged to do so, but it is only a fair thing to do, namely,
			<lb />
			when you bring certain accusation in a solemn document like the Law
			<lb />
			Commission&apos;s Report, you should deal with all the arguments for and
			<lb />
			against. We should have expected in all fairness that these facts ought
			<lb />
			to have been dealt with. Unfortunately, no facts are set out so that it is
			<lb />
			impossible to deal with. If it was said that this had been the case with A,
			<lb />
			this had been the case with B or C, it would have been easy for us to deal
			<lb />
			with them. Especially when we had given all the facts concerning the
			<lb />
			appointment of each and every Judge since 1950.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			82. If one were to draw an inference, from the factual numbers
			<lb />
			indicated in the statements of the Home Minister and the Law Minister,
			<lb />
			and the inferences drawn therefrom, it is more than apparent, that the
			<lb />
			understanding of those in-charge of working the provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, relating to the appointment of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, was that, the advice of the Chief Justice of India was to be, and
			<lb />
			was actually invariably accepted, by the President (or whosoever,
			<lb />
			exercised the power of appointment).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			83. Historically again, from the perspective of judicial declarations, the
			<lb />
			practice adopted on the issue in hand, came to be so understood, in the
			<lb />
			Samsher Singh case 11 , wherein this Court through a seven-Judge Bench
			<lb />
			held as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;In the light of the scheme of the Constitution we have already referred
			<lb />
			to, it is doubtful whether such an interpretation as to the personal
			<lb />
			satisfaction of the President is correct. We are of the view that the
			<lb />
			President means, for all practical purposes, the Minister or the Council of
			<lb />
			Ministers as the case may be, and his opinion, satisfaction or decision is
			<lb />
			constitutionally secured when his Ministers arrive at such opinion
			<lb />
			satisfaction or decision. The independence of the Judiciary, which is a
			<lb />
			cardinal principle of the Constitution and has been relied on to justify
			<lb />
			the deviation, is guarded by the relevant article making consultation with
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India obligatory. In all conceivable cases consultation
			<lb />
			with that highest dignitary of Indian justice will and should be accepted
			<lb />
			by the Government of India and the Court will have an opportunity to
			<lb />
			examine if any other extraneous circumstances have entered into the
			<lb />
			verdict of the Minister, if he departs from the counsel given by the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India. In practice the last word in such a sensitive subject
			<lb />
			must belong to the Chief Justice of India, the rejection of his advice being
			<lb />
			ordinarily regarded as prompted by oblique considerations vitiating the
			<lb />
			order. In this view it is immaterial whether the President or the Prime
			<lb />
			Minister or the Minister for Justice formally decides the issue.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			84. Ever since 1974, when the above judgment was rendered, the
			<lb />
			above declaration, has held the field, as the above judgment has neither
			<lb />
			been reviewed nor set aside.
			<lb />
			It cannot be overlooked, that the
			<lb />
			observations extracted from the Samsher Singh case 11 , were reaffirmed
			<lb />
			by another five-Judge Bench, in the Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth case 5 ,
			<lb />
			as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;This then, in my judgment, is the true meaning and content of
			<lb />
			consultation as envisaged by Article 222(1) of the Constitution. After an
			<lb />
			effective consultation with the Chief Justice of India, it is open to the
			<lb />
			President to arrive at a proper decision of the question whether a Judge
			<lb />
			should be transferred to another High Court because, what the
			<lb />
			Constitution requires is consultation with the Chief Justice, not his
			<lb />
			concurrence with the proposed transfer. But it is necessary to reiterate
			<lb />
			what Bhagwati and Krishna Iyer, JJ., said in Shamsher Singh (supra)
			<lb />
			that in all conceivable cases, consultation with the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			should be accepted by the Government of India and that the Court will
			<lb />
			have an opportunity to examine if any other extraneous circumstances
			<lb />
		</item>
		<note type="other">
			have entered into the verdict of the executive if it departs from the
			<lb />
			counsel given by the Chief Justice of India: &quot;In practice the last word in
			<lb />
			such a sensitive subject must belong to the Chief Justice of India, the
			<lb />
			rejection of his advice being ordinarily regarded as prompted by oblique
			<lb />
			considerations vitiating the order.&quot; (page 873). It is hoped that these
			<lb />
			words will not fall on deaf ears and since normalcy has now been
			<lb />
			restored, the differences, if any, between the executive and the judiciary
			<lb />
			will be resolved by mutual deliberation, each party treating the views of
			<lb />
			the other with respect and consideration.&quot;
			<lb />
		</note>
		<p>
			85. Even in the First Judges case, P.N. Bhagwati, J., corrected his own
			<lb />
			order through a corrigendum, whereby his order, inter alia, came to be
			<lb />
			recorded, as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Even if the opinion given by all the constitutional functionaries
			<lb />
			consulted by it is identical, the Central Government is not bound to act
			<lb />
			in accordance with such opinion, though being a unanimous opinion of
			<lb />
			all three constitutional functionaries, it would have great weight and if
			<lb />
			an appointment is made by the Central Government in defiance of such
			<lb />
			unanimous opinion, it may prima facie be vulnerable to attack on the
			<lb />
			ground that it is mala fide or based on irrelevant grounds. The same
			<lb />
			position would obtain if an appointment is made by the Central
			<lb />
			Government contrary to the unanimous opinion of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			the High Court and the Chief Justice of India.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			From the above extract, it is apparent, that the observations recorded by
			<lb />
			this Court in paragraph 149 in the Samsher Singh case 11 , were endorsed
			<lb />
			in the Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth case 5 , and were also adopted in the
			<lb />
			First Judges case. The position came to be expressed emphatically in the
			<lb />
			Second and Third Judges cases, by reading the term &quot;consultation&quot; as
			<lb />
			vesting primacy with the judiciary, in the matter of appointments of
			<lb />
			Judges to the higher judiciary. This time around, at the hands of two
			<lb />
			different nine-Judge Benches, which reiterated the position expressed in
			<lb />
			the Samsher Singh case 11 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			86. The above sequence reveals, that the executive while giving effect to
			<lb />
			the procedure, for appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary (and
			<lb />
			also, in the matter of transfer of Chief Justices and Judges from one High
			<lb />
			Court, to another), while acknowledging the participation of the other
			<lb />
			constitutional functionaries (referred to in Articles 124, 217 and 222),
			<lb />
			adopted a procedure, wherein primacy in the decision making process,
			<lb />
			was consciously entrusted with the judiciary. This position was followed,
			<lb />
			from the very beginning, after the promulgation of the Constitution, by
			<lb />
			the executive, at its own. Insofar as the legislature is concerned, it is
			<lb />
			apparent, that the issue came up for discussion, in a responsive manner
			<lb />
			when the Fourteenth Report of the Law Commission on Judicial Reforms
			<lb />
			(1958), was discussed by the Parliament, as far back as in 1959, just a
			<lb />
			few years after the country came to be governed by the Constitution. It is
			<lb />
			apparent, that when the two Houses of the Parliament, reflected inter alia
			<lb />
			on Articles 124, 217 and 222, in the matter of appointment of Judges to
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary, the unanimous feeling which emerged was, that &quot;…
			<lb />
			the advice of the most competent dependent and eminent person…&quot; -the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India, had been followed rightfully. Two aspects of the
			<lb />
			parliamentary discussion, which were kept in mind when the issue was
			<lb />
			deliberated, need to be highlighted. First, that the President meant (for
			<lb />
			all practical purposes), the concerned Minister, or the Council of
			<lb />
			Ministers headed by the Prime Minister. And second, that the provisions
			<lb />
			in question envisaged only a participatory role, of the other constitutional
			<lb />
			authorities. Therefore, the above affirmation, to the primacy of the
			<lb />
			judiciary, in the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary,
			<lb />
			was consciously recorded, after having appreciated the gamut of the
			<lb />
			other participating constitutional authorities. In the matter of judicial
			<lb />
			determination, the issue was examined by a Constitution Bench of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court as far back, as in 1974 in the Samsher Singh case 11 ,
			<lb />
			wherein keeping in mind the cardinal principle -the &quot;independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary&quot;, it was concluded, that consultation with the highest
			<lb />
			dignitary in the judiciary -the Chief Justice of India, in practice meant,
			<lb />
			that the last word must belong to the Chief Justice of India i.e., the
			<lb />
			primacy in the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary,
			<lb />
			must rest with the judiciary. The above position was maintained in the
			<lb />
			Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth case 5 in 1977, by a five-Judge Bench, only
			<lb />
			to be altered in the First Judges case, by a seven-Judge Bench in 1981,
			<lb />
			wherein it was held, that the term &quot;consultation&quot; could not be read as
			<lb />
			&quot;concurrence&quot;.
			<lb />
			The position expounded even in this case by P.N.
			<lb />
			Bhagwati, J. (as he then was), extracted above, must necessarily also be
			<lb />
			kept in mind. The earlier position was restored in 1993 by a nine-Judge
			<lb />
			Bench in the Second Judges case (which overruled the First Judges
			<lb />
			case). The position was again reaffirmed by a nine-Judge Bench, through
			<lb />
			the Third Judges case. Historically, therefore, all the three wings of
			<lb />
			governance, have uniformally maintained, that while making
			<lb />
			appointments of Judges to the higher judiciary, &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot; was accepted as an integral component of the spirit of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, and thereby, the term &quot;consultation&quot; used in the provisions
			<lb />
			under consideration, had to be understood as vesting primacy with the
			<lb />
			judiciary, with reference to the subjects contemplated under Articles 124,
			<lb />
			217 and 222. In view of the above historical exposition, there is really no
			<lb />
			legitimate reason for the respondents to seek a review of the judgments in
			<lb />
			the Second and Third Judges cases.

			87. Whilst dwelling on the subject of the intention expressed by the
			<lb />
			Members of the Constituent Assembly, it is considered just and
			<lb />
			expedient, also to take into consideration the views expressed in respect
			<lb />
			of the adoption of &quot;separation of powers&quot; in the Constitution. When the
			<lb />
			draft prepared by the Constituent Assembly came up for debate, Dr. B.R.
			<lb />
			Ambedkar proposed an amendment of Article 39A. It would be relevant
			<lb />
			to mention, that the aforesaid amendment, on being adopted, was
			<lb />
			incorporated as Article 50 in the Constitution (as originally enacted). It is
			<lb />
			also necessary to notice, that the Government had already commenced to
			<lb />
			function, with Jawaharlal Nehru as the Prime Minister, when the draft of
			<lb />
			the Constitution was being debated before the Constituent Assembly.
			<lb />
			His participation in the debates of the Constituent Assembly, therefore,
			<lb />
			was not only in his capacity as a Member of the Constituent Assembly,
			<lb />
			but also, as a representative of the Government of India. It is necessary
			<lb />
			to extract hereunder, the views expressed by Jawaharlal Nehru, Bakshi
			<lb />
			Tek Chand and Loknath Misra, in the above debates, relating to
			<lb />
			&quot;separation of powers&quot;. Relevant extracts are being reproduced
			<lb />
			hereunder:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The Honourable Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru (United Provinces: General):
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			…
		</item>
		<note type="other">
			..Coming to this particular matter, the honourable speaker, Pandit
			<lb />
			Kunzru, who has just spoken and opposed the amendment of Dr.
			<lb />
			Ambedkar seems to me; if I may say so with all respect to him, to have
			<lb />
			gone off the track completely, and to suspect a sinister motive on the part
			<lb />
			of Government about this business. Government as such is not
			<lb />
			concerned with this business, but it is true that some members of
			<lb />
			Government do feel rather strongly about it and would like this House
			<lb />
			fully to consider the particular view point that Dr. Ambedkar has placed
			<lb />
			before the House today. I may say straight off that so far as the
			<lb />
			Government is concerned, it is entirely in favour of the separation of
			<lb />
			judicial and executive functions (Cheers). I may further say that the
			<lb />
			sooner it is brought about the better (Hear, hear) and I am told that some
			<lb />
			of our Provincial Governments are actually taking steps to that end now.
			<lb />
			If anyone asked me, if anyone suggested the period of three years or some
			<lb />
			other period, my first reaction would have been that this period is too
			<lb />
			long. Why should we wait so long for this? It might be brought about, if
			<lb />
			not all over India, in a large part
		</note>
		<p>
			of India, much sooner than that. At the
			<lb />
			same time, it is obvious that India at the present moment, specially
			<lb />
			during the transitional period, is a very mixed country politically,
			<lb />
			judicially, economically and in many ways, and any fixed rule of thumb
			<lb />
			to
		</p>
		<item>
			be applied to every area may be disadvantageous and difficult in
			<lb />
			regard to certain areas. On the one hand, that rule will really prevent
			<lb />
			progress in one area, and on the other hand, it may upset the apple-cart
			<lb />
			in some other area. Therefore, a certain flexibility is desirable. Generally
			<lb />
			speaking, I would have said that in any such directive of policy, it may
			<lb />
			not be legal, but any directive of policy in a Constitution must have a
			<lb />
			powerful effect. In any such directive, there should not be any detail or
			<lb />
			time-limit etc. It is a directive of what the State wants, and your putting
			<lb />
			in any kind of time-limit therefore rather lowers it from that high status
			<lb />
			of a State policy and brings it down to the level of a legislative measure,
			<lb />
			which it is not in that sense. I would have preferred no time-limit to be
			<lb />
			there, but speaking more practically, any time-limit in this, as Dr.
			<lb />
			Ambedkar pointed out, is apt on the one hand to delay this very process
			<lb />
			in large parts of the country, probably the greater part of the country; on
			<lb />
			the other hand, in some parts where practically speaking it may be very
			<lb />
			difficult to bring about, it may produce enormous confusion. I think,
			<lb />
			therefore, that Dr. Ambedkar&apos;s amendment, far from lessening the
			<lb />
			significance or the importance of this highly desirable change that we
			<lb />
			wish to bring about, places it on a high level before the country. And I do
			<lb />
			not see myself how any Provincial or other Government can forget this
			<lb />
			Directive or delay it much. After all, whatever is going to be done in the
			<lb />
			future will largely depend upon the sentiment of the people and the
			<lb />
			future Assemblies and Parliaments that will meet. But so far as this
			<lb />
			Constitution is concerned, it gives a strong opinion in favour of this
			<lb />
			change and it gives it in a way so as to make it possible to bring it about
			<lb />
			in areas where it can be brought about -the provinces, etc. -and in case
			<lb />
			of difficulty in any particular State, etc., it does not bind them down. I
			<lb />
		</item>
		<note type="other">
			submit, therefore, that this amendment of Dr. Ambedkar should be
			<lb />
			accepted. (Cheers).&quot;
			<lb />
			&quot;Dr. Bakshi Tek Chand (East Punjab: General): Mr. Vice-President, Sir, I
			<lb />
			rise to lend my whole hearted support to the amendment which has been
			<lb />
			moved by Dr. Ambedkar today. The question of the separation of
			<lb />
			executive and judicial functions is not only as old as
		</note>
		<p>
			the Congress itself,
			<lb />
			but indeed it is much older. It was in the year 1852 when public opinion
			<lb />
			in Bengal began to express itself in an organised form that the matter
			<lb />
			was first mooted. That was more than thirty years before the Congress
			<lb />
			came into existence. After the Mutiny, the movement gained momentum
			<lb />
			and in the early seventies, in Bengal, under the leadership of Kisto Das
			<lb />
			Pal and Ram Gopal Ghosh, who were the leaders of public opinion in
			<lb />
			those days, definite proposals with regard to the separation of judicial
			<lb />
			and executive functions were put forward. Subsequently, the late Man
			<lb />
			Mohan Ghosh took up this matter and he and Babu Surendranath
			<lb />
			Bannerji year in and year out raised this question in all public meetings.
			<lb />
			When the Congress first met in the session in Bombay in 1885, this
			<lb />
			reform in the administration was put in the forefront of its programme.
			<lb />
			Later on, not only politicians of all schools of thought, but even retired
			<lb />
			officers who had actually spent their lives in the administration, took up
			<lb />
			the
		</p>
		<item>
			matter and lent their support to it. I very well remember the Lucknow
			<lb />
			Congress of 1899 when Romesh Chunder Dutt, who had just retired from
			<lb />
			the Indian Civil Service, presided. He devoted a large part of his
			<lb />
			presidential address to this subject and created a good deal of
			<lb />
			enthusiasm for it. Not only that: even retired High Court Judges and
			<lb />
			Englishmen like Sir Arthur Hobhouse and Sir Arthur Wilson, both of
			<lb />
			whom subsequently became members of the Judicial Committee of the
			<lb />
			Privy Council, lent their support to this and they jointly with many
			<lb />
			eminent Indians submitted a representation to the Secretary of State for
			<lb />
			India to give immediate effect to this reform.
			<lb />
			In the year 1912, when the Public Service Commission was appointed,
			<lb />
			Mr. Abdur Rahim, who was a Judge of the Madras High Court and was
			<lb />
			for many years the President of the Central Legislature, appended a long
			<lb />
			Minute of Dissent and therein he devoted several pages to this question.
			<lb />
			Therefore, Sir, the matter has been before the country for nearly a
			<lb />
			century and it is time that it is given effect to immediately. One of the
			<lb />
			Honourable Members who spoke yesterday, observed that this matter
			<lb />
			was of great importance when we had a foreign Government but now the
			<lb />
			position has changed, and it may not be necessary to give effect to it.
			<lb />
			Well, an effective reply to this has been given by the Honourable the
			<lb />
			Prime Minister today. He has expressly stated that it is the policy of the
			<lb />
			Government, and it is their intention to see that this reform is given
			<lb />
			immediate effect to.
			<lb />
			xxxx
			<lb />
			xxxx
			<lb />
			xxxx
			<lb />
			I am glad to hear that he confirms it. This gives the quietus to these two
			<lb />
			objections which have been raised, that because of the changed
			<lb />
			circumstances, because we have attained freedom, it is no longer
			<lb />
			necessary and that the financial burden will be so heavy that it might
			<lb />
			crush provincial Governments. Both these objections are hollow.
			<lb />
			One word more I have to say in this connection and that is, that with the
			<lb />
			advent of democracy and freedom, the necessity of this reform has
			<lb />
			become all the greater. Formerly it was only the district magistrate and a
			<lb />
			few members of the bureaucratic Government from whom interference
			<lb />
			with the judiciary was apprehended, but now, I am very sorry to say that
			<lb />
			even the Ministers in some provinces and members of political parties
			<lb />
			have begun to interfere with the free administration of justice. Those of
			<lb />
			you, who may be reading news paper reports of judicial decisions lately,
			<lb />
			must have been struck with this type of interference which has been
			<lb />
			under review in the various High Courts lately. In one province we found
			<lb />
			that in a case pending in a Criminal Court, the Ministry sent for the
			<lb />
			record and passed an order directing the trying Magistrate to stay
			<lb />
			proceedings in the case. This was something absolutely unheard of. The
			<lb />
			matter eventually went up to the High Court and the learned Chief
			<lb />
			Justice and another Judge had to pass very strong remarks against such
			<lb />
			executive interference with the administration of justice.
			<lb />
			In another province a case was being tried against a member of the
			<lb />
			Legislative Assembly and a directive went from the District Magistrate to
			<lb />
			the Magistrate trying the case not to proceed with it further and to
			<lb />
			release the man. The Magistrate who was a member of the Judicial
			<lb />
			Service and was officiating as a Magistrate had the strength to resist this
			<lb />
			demand. He had all those letters put on the record and eventually the
			<lb />
			matter went up to the High Court and the Chief Justice of the Calcutta
			<lb />
			High Court made very strong remarks about this matter.
			<lb />
			Again in the Punjab, a case has recently occurred in which a Judge of the
			<lb />
			High Court, Mr. Justice Achu Ram, heard a habeas corpus petition and
			<lb />
			delivered a judgment of 164 pages at the conclusion of which he observed
			<lb />
			that the action taken by the District Magistrate and the Superintendent
			<lb />
			of Police against a member of the Congress Party was mala fide and was
			<lb />
			the result of a personal vendetta. These were his remarks.
			<lb />
			In these circumstances, I submit that with the change of circumstances
			<lb />
			and with the advent of freedom and the introduction of democracy, it has
			<lb />
			become all the more necessary to bring about the separation of the
			<lb />
			judiciary from the executive at the earliest possible opportunity.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			88. A perusal of the statements made before the Constituent Assembly,
			<lb />
			which resulted in the adoption of Article 50 of the Constitution reveals,
			<lb />
			that the first Prime Minister of this country, was entirely in favour of the
			<lb />
			separation of judicial and executive &quot;functions&quot;. On the subject of
			<lb />
			separation, it was pointed out, that it was a directive which the
			<lb />
			Government itself wanted. The statement of Dr. Bakshi Tek Chand in the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly projects the position, that the idea of separating
			<lb />
			the judiciary from the executive was mooted for the first time as far back
			<lb />
			as in 1852, and that thereafter, the political leadership and also public
			<lb />
			opinion, were directed towards ensuring separation of judicial and
			<lb />
			executive functioning. He pointed out, that &quot;year in and year out&quot;, the
			<lb />
			late Man Mohan Ghosh and Bapu Surendranath Banerji had raised the
			<lb />
			instant question, in all public meetings. And when the Congress first met
			<lb />
			in Bombay in 1885, the matter of separating the judiciary from the
			<lb />
			executive, was placed above all other issues under consideration.
			<lb />
			Thereafter, not only the politicians of all schools of thought, but even
			<lb />
			retired officers, who had actually spent their lives in administration, had
			<lb />
			supported the issue of &quot;separation of powers&quot;. He also highlighted, that
			<lb />
			in 1899, Romesh Chunder Dutt had devoted a large part of his
			<lb />
			presidential address to the issue. And that, retired High Court Judges
			<lb />
			and Englishmen like Sir Arthur Hobhouse and Sir Arthur Wilson (both of
			<lb />
			whom, subsequently became Members of the Judicial Committee of the
			<lb />
			Privy Council), also supported the above reform. The debate, it was
			<lb />
			pointed out, had been on going, to accept the principle of &quot;separation of
			<lb />
			powers&quot;, whereby, the judiciary would be kept apart from the executive.
			<lb />
			He also pointed to instances, indicating interference by Ministers and
			<lb />
			members of the administration, which necessitated a complete separation
			<lb />
			of powers between the judiciary and the executive. Loknath Misra fully
			<lb />
			supported the above amendment, as a matter of principle. It is, therefore,
			<lb />
			imperative to conclude that the framers of the Constitution while drafting
			<lb />
			Article 50 of the Constitution, were clear and unanimous in their view,
			<lb />
			that there need to be a judiciary, separated from the influences of the
			<lb />
			executive.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			89. Based on the consideration recorded in the immediately preceding
			<lb />
			paragraphs also, it seems to us, that the necessity of making a detailed
			<lb />
			reference to the Constituent Assembly debates in the Second Judges
			<lb />
			case, may well have been regarded, as of no serious consequence,
			<lb />
			whether it was on the subject of appointment of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, as a component of &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, or, on the
			<lb />
			subject of &quot;separation of powers&quot;, whereby the judiciary was sought to be
			<lb />
			kept apart, and separate, from the executive. This Court having
			<lb />
			concluded, that the principle of &quot;separation of powers&quot; was expressly
			<lb />
			ingrained in the Constitution, which removes the executive from any role
			<lb />
			in the judiciary, the right of the executive to have the final word in the
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, was clearly ruled out.
			<lb />
			And therefore, this Court on a harmonious construction of the provisions
			<lb />
			of the Constitution, in the Second and Third Judges cases, rightfully
			<lb />
			held, that primacy in the above matter, vested with the judiciary, leading
			<lb />
			to the inference, that the term &quot;consultation&quot; in the provisions under
			<lb />
			reference, should be understood as giving primacy to the view expressed
			<lb />
			by the judiciary, through the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			VI.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			90. It is imperative to deal with another important submission
			<lb />
			advanced by the learned Attorney General, namely, that the issue of
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; has nothing to do with the process of
			<lb />
			&quot;appointment&quot; of Judges to the higher judiciary. It was submitted, that
			<lb />
			the question of independence of a Judge arises, only after a Judge has
			<lb />
			been appointed (to the higher judiciary), for it is only then, that he is to
			<lb />
			be shielded from the executive/political pressures and influences. It was
			<lb />
			sought to be elaborated, that Judges of the higher judiciary, immediately
			<lb />
			after their appointment were so well shielded, that there could be no
			<lb />
			occasion of the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; being compromised, in
			<lb />
			any manner, either at the hands of the executive, or of the legislature.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			91. Whilst advancing the instant contention, it was the pointed
			<lb />
			assertion of the learned Attorney General, that neither of the judgments
			<lb />
			rendered in the Second and Third Judges cases had held, that the
			<lb />
			&quot;selection and appointment&quot; of Judges, to the higher judiciary, would fall
			<lb />
			within the purview of &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. It was therefore his
			<lb />
			contention, that it was wrongful to assume, on the basis of the above two
			<lb />
			judgments, that the question of &quot;appointment&quot; of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary would constitute a component of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. It was the contention of the learned Attorney General, that
			<lb />
			the Parliament, in its wisdom, had now amended the Constitution,
			<lb />
			admittedly altering the process of &quot;selection and appointment&quot; of Judges
			<lb />
			to the higher judiciary (including their transfer). It was further
			<lb />
			contended, that the process contemplated through the Constitution (99th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, coupled with the NJAC Act, was such, that it cannot be
			<lb />
			considered to have interfered with, or impinged upon, the &quot;independence
			<lb />
			of the judiciary&quot;, and thus viewed, it would not be rightful to conclude,
			<lb />
			that the impugned constitutional amendment, as also the NJAC Act, were
			<lb />
			per se violative of the &quot;basic structure&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			92. We may preface our consideration by noticing, that every two years
			<lb />
			since 1985, a conference of Supreme Court Chief Justices from the Asia
			<lb />
			Pacific region, has been held by the Judicial Section of the Law
			<lb />
			Association for Asia and the Pacific. Since its inception, the conference
			<lb />
			has served as a useful forum for sharing information and discussing
			<lb />
			issues of mutual concern among Chief Justices of the region. At its 6th
			<lb />
			Conference held in Beijing in 1997, 20 Chief Justices adopted a joint
			<lb />
			Statement of Principles of the &quot;Independence of the Judiciary&quot;. This
			<lb />
			statement was further refined during the 7th Conference of Chief
			<lb />
			Justices held in Manila, wherein it was signed by 32 Chief Justices from
			<lb />
			the Asia Pacific region. The Beijing Statement of Principles of the
			<lb />
			&quot;Independence of the Judiciary&quot; separately deals with appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges. The position expressed in the above statement with reference to
			<lb />
			&quot;appointment&quot; of Judges is extracted hereunder:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Appointment of Judges
			<lb />
			11. To enable the judiciary to achieve its objectives and perform its
			<lb />
			functions, it is essential that judges be chosen on the basis of proven
			<lb />
			competence, integrity and independence.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			12.The mode of appointment of judges must be such as will ensure the
			<lb />
			appointment of persons who are best qualified for judicial office. It must
			<lb />
			provide safeguards against improper influences being taken into account
			<lb />
			so that only persons of competence, integrity and independence are
			<lb />
			appointed.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			13. In the selection of judges there must no discrimination against a
			<lb />
			person on the basis of race, colour, gender, religion, political or other
			<lb />
			opinion, national or social origin, marital status, sexual orientation,
			<lb />
			property, birth or status, expect that a requirement that a candidate for
			<lb />
			judicial office must be a national of the country concerned shall not be
			<lb />
			considered discriminatory.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			14. The structure of the legal profession, and the sources from which
			<lb />
			judges are drawn within the legal profession, differ in different societies.
			<lb />
			In some societies, the judiciary is a career service; in others, judges are
			<lb />
			chosen from the practising profession. Therefore, it is accepted that in
			<lb />
			different societies, difference procedures and safeguards may be adopted
			<lb />
			to ensure the proper appointment of judges.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			15. In some societies, the appointment of judges, by, with the consent of,
			<lb />
			or after consultation with a Judicial Services Commission has been seen
			<lb />
			as a means of ensuring that those chosen judges are appropriate for the
			<lb />
			purpose. Where a Judicial Services Commission is adopted, it should
			<lb />
			include representatives the higher Judiciary and the independent legal
			<lb />
			profession as a means of ensuring that judicial competence, integrity and
			<lb />
			independence are maintained.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16. In the absence of a Judicial Services Commission, the procedures for
			<lb />
			appointment of judges should be clearly defined and formalised and
			<lb />
			information about them should be available to the public.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			17. Promotion of judges must be based on an objective assessment of
			<lb />
			factors such as competence, integrity, independence and experience.&quot;
			<lb />
			Therefore to contend, that the subject of &quot;appointment&quot; is irrelevant to
			<lb />
			the question of the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, must be considered
			<lb />
			as a misunderstanding of a well recognized position.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			93. Whilst dealing with the instant contention, we will also examine if
			<lb />
			this Court in the Second and Third Judges cases, had actually dealt with
			<lb />
			the issue, whether &quot;appointment&quot; of Judges to the higher judiciary, was
			<lb />
			(or, was not) an essential component of the principle of &quot;independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary&quot;? Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned,
			<lb />
			reference in the first instance, may be made to the Second Judges case,
			<lb />
			wherein S. Ratnavel Pandian, J., while recording his concurring opinion,
			<lb />
			supporting the majority view, observed as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;47. The above arguments, that the independence of judiciary is
			<lb />
			satisfactorily secured by the constitutional safeguard of the office that a
			<lb />
			judge holds and guarantees of the service conditions alone and not
			<lb />
			beyond that, are in our considered opinion, untenable. In fact we are
			<lb />
			unable even to conceive such an argument for the reason to be presently
			<lb />
			stated.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			In addition to the above extract, it is necessary to refer to the following
			<lb />
			observations of Kuldip Singh, J.:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;335. Then the question which comes up for consideration is, can there
			<lb />
			be an independent judiciary when the power of appointment of judges
			<lb />
			vests in the executive? To say yes, would be illogical....&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			From the above it is clear, that the issue canvassed by the learned
			<lb />
			Attorney General, was finally answered by the nine-Judge Bench, which
			<lb />
			disposed of the Second Judges case by holding, that if the power of
			<lb />
			&quot;appointment&quot; of Judges, was left to the executive, the same would
			<lb />
			breach the principle of the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. And also
			<lb />
			conversely, that providing safeguards after the appointment of a Judge to
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary, would not be sufficient to secure &quot;independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary&quot;. In the above view of the matter, it is necessary to
			<lb />
			conclude, that the &quot;manner of selection and appointment&quot; of Judges to
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary, is an integral component of &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot;. The contentions advanced on behalf of the Union of India,
			<lb />
			indicating the participation of the President and the Parliament, in the
			<lb />
			affairs of the judiciary, would have no bearing on the controversy in
			<lb />
			hand, which primarily relates to the issue of &quot;appointment&quot; of Judges to
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary. And, extends to transfer of Chief Justices and
			<lb />
			Judges from one High Court, to another. The fact that there were
			<lb />
			sufficient safeguards, to secure the independence of Judges of the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary after their &quot;appointment&quot;, and therefore, there was no need to
			<lb />
			postulate, that in the matter of &quot;appointment&quot; also, primacy need not be
			<lb />
			in the hands of the judiciary, is also not acceptable. It is quite another
			<lb />
			matter, whether the manner of selection and appointment of Judges,
			<lb />
			introduced through the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act coupled with
			<lb />
			the NJAC Act, can indeed be considered to be violative of &quot;independence
			<lb />
			of the judiciary&quot;. This aspect, shall be examined and determined
			<lb />
			independently, while examining the merits of the challenge raised by the
			<lb />
			petitioners.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			VII.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			94. A perusal of the provisions of the Constitution reveals, that in
			<lb />
			addition to the appointment of the Chief Justice of India and Judges of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court, under Article 124, the President has also been vested
			<lb />
			with the authority to appoint Judges and Chief Justices of High Courts
			<lb />
			under Article 217. In both the above provisions, the mandate for the
			<lb />
			President, inter alia is, that the Chief Justice of India &quot;shall always be
			<lb />
			consulted&quot;, (the first proviso, under Article 124(2), as originally enacted),
			<lb />
			and with reference to Judges of the High Court, the language engaged in
			<lb />
			Article 217 was, that the President would appoint Judges of High Courts
			<lb />
			&quot;after consultation with the Chief Justice of India&quot; (per sub-Article (1) of
			<lb />
			Article 217).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			95. To understand the term &quot;consultation&quot; engaged in Articles 124 and
			<lb />
			217, it is essential to contrast the above two provisions, with other
			<lb />
			Articles of the Constitution, whereunder also, the President is mandated
			<lb />
			to appoint different constitutional authorities. Reference in this behalf
			<lb />
			may be made to the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor-General
			<lb />
			of India, under Article 148. The said provision vests the authority of the
			<lb />
			above appointment with the President, without any consultative process.
			<lb />
			The position is exactly similar with reference to appointment of
			<lb />
			Governors of States, under Article 155.
			<lb />
			The said provision also
			<lb />
			contemplates appointments, without any consultative process.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			President is also vested with the authority, to appoint the Chairman and
			<lb />
			four Members of the Finance Commission, under Article 280. Herein
			<lb />
			also, the power is exclusively vested with the President, without any
			<lb />
			consultative process. The power of appointment of Chairman and other
			<lb />
			Members of the Union Public Service Commission, is also vested with the
			<lb />
			President under Article 316. The aforesaid appointment also does not
			<lb />
			contemplate any deliberation, with any other authority. Under Article
			<lb />
			324, the power of appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and
			<lb />
			Election Commissioners is vested with the President exclusively.
			<lb />
			Likewise, is the case of appointment of Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson
			<lb />
			and Members of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes under
			<lb />
			Article 338, and Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson and other Members of
			<lb />
			the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes under Article 338A.
			<lb />
			Under the above stated provisions, the President has the exclusive
			<lb />
			authority to make appointments, without any deliberation with any other
			<lb />
			authority. Under Article 344, the President is also vested with the
			<lb />
			authority to appoint Chairman and other Members to the Commission of
			<lb />
			Parliament on Official Languages. The instant provision also does not
			<lb />
			provide for any consultative process before such appointment. The same
			<lb />
			position emerges from Article 350B, whereunder the President is to
			<lb />
			appoint a Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities. Herein too, there is no
			<lb />
			contemplation of any prior consultation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			96. It is apparent that the Council of Ministers, with the Prime Minister
			<lb />
			as its head, is to &quot;aid and advise&quot; the President in the exercise of his
			<lb />
			functions. This position is not disputed by the learned counsel
			<lb />
			representing the respondents. Interpreted in the above manner,
			<lb />
			according to the learned Attorney General, in exercising his
			<lb />
			responsibilities under Articles 124, 217, 148, 155, 280, 316, 324, 338,
			<lb />
			338A, 344 and 350B, the President is only a figurative authority, whereas
			<lb />
			truthfully, the authority actually vests in the Council of Ministers headed
			<lb />
			by the Prime Minister. And as such, for all intents and purposes, the
			<lb />
			authority vested in the President for appointing different constitutional
			<lb />
			authorities, truly means that the power of such appointment is vested in
			<lb />
			the executive.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			97. If one were to understand the words, as they were expressed in
			<lb />
			Article 74, in our considered view, it would be difficult to conclude, that
			<lb />
			&quot;aid and advice&quot; can be treated synonymous with a binding &quot;direction&quot;,
			<lb />
			an irrevocable &quot;command&quot; or a conclusive &quot;mandate&quot;. Surely, the term
			<lb />
			&quot;aid and advice&quot; cannot individually be construed as an imperative
			<lb />
			dictate, which had to be obeyed under all circumstances. In common
			<lb />
			parlance, a process of &quot;consultation&quot; is really the process of &quot;aid and
			<lb />
			advice&quot;. The only distinction being, that &quot;consultation&quot; is obtained,
			<lb />
			whereas &quot;aid and advice&quot; may be tendered. On a plain readingtherefore,
			<lb />
			neither of the two (&quot;aid and advice&quot; and &quot;consultation&quot;) can be
			<lb />
			understood to convey, that they can be of a binding nature. We are of
			<lb />
			the view, that the above expressions were used, keeping in mind the
			<lb />
			exalted position which the President occupies (as the first citizen, of the
			<lb />
			country). As the first citizen, it would have been discourteous to provide,
			<lb />
			that he was to discharge his functions in consonance with the directions,
			<lb />
			command, or mandate of the executive. Since, both the expressions (&quot;aid
			<lb />
			and advice&quot; and &quot;consultation&quot;), deserve the same interpretation, if any
			<lb />
			one of them is considered to be mandatory and binding, the same import
			<lb />
			with reference to the other must follow. Through the Constitution
			<lb />
			(Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976, Article 74 came to be amended,
			<lb />
			and with the insertion of the words &quot;shall … act in accordance with such
			<lb />
			advice&quot;, the President came to be bound, to exercise his functions, in
			<lb />
			consonance with the &quot;aid and advice&quot; tendered to him, by the Council of
			<lb />
			Ministers headed by the Prime Minister. The instant amendment, in our
			<lb />
			view, has to be considered as clarificatory in character, merely reiterating
			<lb />
			the manner in which the original provision ought to have been
			<lb />
			understood.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			98. If &quot;aid and advice&quot; can be binding and mandatory, surely also, the
			<lb />
			term &quot;consultation&quot;, referred to in Articles 124 and 217, could lead to the
			<lb />
			same exposition. The President of India, being the first citizen of the
			<lb />
			country, is entitled to respectability. Articles 124 and 217, were
			<lb />
			undoubtedly couched in polite language, as a matter of constitutional
			<lb />
			courtesy, extended to the first citizen of the country. It is important to
			<lb />
			notice, that the first proviso under Article 124(2) clearly mandates, that
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India &quot;shall always&quot; be consulted. It was a reverse
			<lb />
			obligation, distinguishable from Article 74. Herein, the President was
			<lb />
			obliged to consult the Chief Justice of India, in all matters of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court. The process of
			<lb />
			&quot;consultation&quot; contemplated therein, has to be meaningfully understood.
			<lb />
			If it was not to be so, the above provision could have been similarly
			<lb />
			worded as those relating to the appointment of the Comptroller and
			<lb />
			Auditor-General of India, Governors of States, Chairman and Members of
			<lb />
			the Finance Commission, Chairman and Members of the Union Public
			<lb />
			Service Commission, Chief Election Commissioner and Election
			<lb />
			Commissioners, Chairperson and Vice Chairperson and Members of the
			<lb />
			National Commission for Scheduled Castes, as also, those of the National
			<lb />
			Commission for Scheduled Tribes. This contrast between Articles 124
			<lb />
			and 217 on the one hand, and the absence of any &quot;consultation&quot;, with
			<lb />
			reference to the appointments contemplated under Articles 148, 155,
			<lb />
			280, 316, 324, 338, 338A, 344 and 350B, leaves no room for any doubt,
			<lb />
			that the above &quot;consultation&quot; was not a simplicitor &quot;consultation&quot;. And
			<lb />
			since, the highest functionary in the judicial hierarchy was obliged to be
			<lb />
			consulted, a similar respectability needed to be bestowed on him. What
			<lb />
			would be the worth of the mandatory &quot;consultation&quot;, with the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, if his advice could be rejected, without any justification?
			<lb />
			It was therefore, concluded by this Court, that in all conceivable cases,
			<lb />
			consultation with the highest dignitary in the judiciary -the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, will and should be accepted. And, in case it was not so
			<lb />
			acceptd, it would be permissible to examine whether such non
			<lb />
			acceptance was prompted by any oblique consideration. Rightfully
			<lb />
			therefore, the term &quot;consultation&quot; used in Articles 124 and 217, as they
			<lb />
			were originally enacted meant, that primacy had to be given to the
			<lb />
			opinion tendered by the Chief Justice of India, on the issues for which
			<lb />
			the President was obliged to seek such &quot;consultation&quot;. The submission
			<lb />
			advanced on behalf of the respondents, cannot be accepted, also for the
			<lb />
			reason, that the interpretation placed by them on the term
			<lb />
			&quot;consultation&quot;, would result in an interpretation of Articles 124 and 217,
			<lb />
			as at par with Articles 148, 155, 280, 316, 324, 338, 338A, 344 and
			<lb />
			350B, wherein the term &quot;consultation&quot; had not been used. Such an
			<lb />
			interpretation, would be clearly unacceptable. Since the manner of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, is in contrast with that of
			<lb />
			the constitutional authorities referred to by the learned Attorney General,
			<lb />
			the submission advanced on behalf of the respondents with reference to
			<lb />
			the other constitutional authorities cannot have a bearing on the present
			<lb />
			controversy.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			99. We would unhesitatingly accept and acknowledge the submission
			<lb />
			made by the learned Attorney General, as has been noticed hereinabove,
			<lb />
			but only limited to situations of appointment contemplated under various
			<lb />
			Articles of the Constitution, where the power of appointment is
			<lb />
			exclusively vested with the President. As such, there is no room for any
			<lb />
			doubt that the provisions of the Constitution, with reference to the
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, contemplated that the &quot;aid
			<lb />
			and advice&quot; (-the &quot;consultation&quot;) tendered by the Chief Justice of India,
			<lb />
			was entitled to primacy, on matters regulated under Articles 124 and 217
			<lb />
			(as also, under Article 222).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			VIII.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			100. In continuation with the conclusions drawn in the foregoing
			<lb />
			analysis, the matter can be examined from another perspective as well.
			<lb />
			The term &quot;consultation&quot; (in connection with, appointments of Judges to
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary) has also been adopted in Article 233 on the subject
			<lb />
			of appointment of District Judges. Under Article 233, the power of
			<lb />
			appointment is vested with the Governor of the concerned State, who is
			<lb />
			empowered to make appointments (including promotions) of District
			<lb />
			Judges. This Court, through a five-Judge Bench, in Registrar (Admn.),
			<lb />
			High Court of Orissa, Cuttack v. Sisir Kanta Satapathy 32 , has held, that
			<lb />
			recommendations made by the High Court in the consultative process
			<lb />
			envisaged under Article 233, is binding on the Governor. In the face of
			<lb />
			the aforestated binding precedent, on a controversy, which is startlingly
			<lb />
			similar to the one in hand, and has never been questioned, it is quite
			<lb />
			ununderstandable how the Union of India, desires to persuade this
			<lb />
			Court, to now examine the term &quot;consultation&quot; differently with reference
			<lb />
			to Articles 124 and 217, without assailing the meaning given to the
			<lb />
			aforesaid term, with reference to a matter also governing the judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			VI. CONCLUSION:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			101. Based on the conclusions drawn hereinabove, while considering the
			<lb />
			submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the rival parties, as
			<lb />
			have been recorded in &quot;V -The Consideration&quot;, we are of the view, that
			<lb />
			the prayer made at the hands of the learned counsel for the respondents,
			<lb />
			for revisiting or reviewing the judgments rendered by this Court, in the
			<lb />
			Second and Third Judges cases, cannot be acceded to. The prayer is,
			<lb />
			accordingly, hereby declined.

			THE ORDER ON MERITS
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			I.
			<lb />
			PREFACE:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			1.
			<lb />
			It is essential to begin the instant order by a foreword, in the nature
			<lb />
			of an explanation. For, it would reduce the bulk of the instant order, and
			<lb />
			obviate the necessity to deal with issues which have been considered and
			<lb />
			dealt with, while hearing the present set of cases.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			2.
			<lb />
			The question which arises for consideration in the present set of
			<lb />
			cases pertains to the constitutional validity of the Constitution
			<lb />
			(Ninety-ninth Amendment) Act, 2014 [hereinafter referred to as the
			<lb />
			Constitution (99th Amendment) Act], as also, that of the National
			<lb />
			Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014 (hereinafter referred to as,
			<lb />
			the NJAC Act). The core issue that arises for consideration, relates to the
			<lb />
			validity of the process of selection and appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary (i.e., Chief Justices and Judges of the High Courts and
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court), and transfer of Chief Justices and Judges of one
			<lb />
			High Court, to another.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3.
			<lb />
			This is the third order in the series of orders passed by us, while
			<lb />
			adjudicating upon the present controversy. The first order, dealt with the
			<lb />
			prayer made at the Bar, for the &quot;recusal&quot; of one of us (J.S. Khehar, J.)
			<lb />
			from hearing the present set of cases. As and when a reference is made
			<lb />
			to the above first order, it would be adverted to as the &quot;Recusal Order&quot;.
			<lb />
			The second order, considered the prayer made by the learned Attorney
			<lb />
			General and some learned counsel representing the respondents, seeking
			<lb />
			a &quot;reference&quot; of the present controversy, to a nine-Judge Bench (or even,
			<lb />
			to a further larger Bench) for re-examining the judgment rendered in
			<lb />
			Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of India 2
			<lb />
			(hereinafter referred to as, the Second Judges case), and the advisory
			<lb />
			opinion in Re: Special Reference No.1 of 1998 3 (hereinafter referred to, as
			<lb />
			the Third Judges case), for the alleged object of restoring and
			<lb />
			re-establishing, the declaration of the legal position, expounded by this
			<lb />
			Court in S.P. Gupta v. Union of India 1 (hereinafter referred to as, the First
			<lb />
			Judges case). As and when a reference is made to the above second
			<lb />
			order, it would be mentioned as the &quot;Reference Order&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			We would, therefore, not examine the issues dealt with in the
			<lb />
			Recusal Order and/or in the Reference Order, even though they may
			<lb />
			arise for consideration yet again, in the process of disposal of the present
			<lb />
			controversy on merits. As and when a reference is made to the instant
			<lb />
			third order, examining the &quot;merits&quot; of the controversy, it would be
			<lb />
			adverted to as the &quot;Order on Merits&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			II.
			<lb />
			PETITIONERS&apos; CONTENTIONS, ON MERITS:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			On the subject of amending the Constitution based on the
			<lb />
			procedure provided for in Article 368, it was submitted by Mr. Fali S.
			<lb />
			Nariman, Senior Advocate, that the power of amendment of the
			<lb />
			Constitution is not a plenary power. It was pointed out, that the above
			<lb />
			power was limited, inasmuch as, the power of amendment did not
			<lb />
			include the power of amending the &quot;core&quot; or the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. In this behalf, learned counsel placed reliance on Minerva
			<lb />
			Mills Ltd. v. Union of India 33 , wherein majority view was expressed
			<lb />
			through Y.V. Chandrachud, CJ., as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;17. Since the Constitution had conferred a limited amending power on
			<lb />
			the Parliament, the Parliament cannot under the exercise of that limited
			<lb />
			power enlarge that very power into an absolute power. Indeed, a limited
			<lb />
			amending power is one of the basic features of our Constitution and
			<lb />
			therefore, the limitations on that power cannot be destroyed. In other
			<lb />
			words, Parliament cannot, under Article 368 , expand its amending power
			<lb />
			so as to acquire for itself the right to repeal or abrogate the Constitution
			<lb />
			or to destroy its basic and essential features. The donee of a limited
			<lb />
			power cannot by the exercise of that power convert the limited power into
			<lb />
			an unlimited one.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			In the above judgment, the minority view was recorded by P.N. Bhagwati,
			<lb />
			J., (as he then was), as under:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;88. That takes us to clause (5) of Article 368. This clause opens with the
			<lb />
			words &quot;for the removal of doubts&quot; and proceeds to declare that there shall
			<lb />
			be no limitation whatever on the amending power of Parliament under
			<lb />
			Article 368. It is difficult to appreciate the meaning of the opening words
			<lb />
			&quot;for the removal of doubts&quot; because the majority decision in Kesavananda
			<lb />
			Bharati case : AIR 1973 SC 1461 clearly laid down and left no doubt that
			<lb />
			the basic structure of the Constitution was outside the competence of the
			<lb />
			amendatory power of Parliament and in Indira Gandhi case : [1976] 2
			<lb />
			SCR 341, all the judges unanimously accepted theory of the basic
			<lb />
			structure as a theory by which the validity of the amendment impugned
			<lb />
			before them, namely, Article 329-A(4) was to be judged. Therefore, after
			<lb />
			the decisions in Kesavananda Bharati case and Indira Gandhi case, there
			<lb />
			was no doubt at all that the amendatory power of Parliament was limited
			<lb />
			and it was not competent to Parliament to alter the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution and clause (5) could not remove the doubt which did not
			<lb />
			exist. What clause (5), really sought to do was to remove the limitation on
			<lb />
			the amending power of Parliament and convert it from a limited power
			<lb />
			into an unlimited one. This was clearly and indubitably a futile exercise
			<lb />
			on the part of Parliament. I fail to see how Parliament which has only a
			<lb />
			limited power of amendment and which cannot alter the basic structure
			<lb />
			of the Constitution can expand its power of amendment so as to confer
			<lb />
			upon itself the power of repeal or abrogate the Constitution or to damage
			<lb />
			or destroy its basic structure. That would clearly be in excess of the
			<lb />
			limited amending power possessed by Parliament. The Constitution has
			<lb />
			conferred only a limited amending power on Parliament so that it cannot
			<lb />
			damage or destroy the basic structure of the Constitution and Parliament
			<lb />
			cannot by exercise of that limited amending power convert that very
			<lb />
			power into an absolute and unlimited power. If it were permissible to
			<lb />
			Parliament to enlarge the limited amending power conferred upon it into
			<lb />
			an absolute power of amendment, then it was meaningless to place a
			<lb />
			limitation on the original power of amendment. It is difficult to appreciate
			<lb />
			how Parliament having a limited power of amendment can get rid of the
			<lb />
			limitation by exercising that very power and convert it into an absolute
			<lb />
			power. Clause (5) of Article 368 which sought to remove the limitation on
			<lb />
			the amending power of Parliament by making it absolute must therefore
			<lb />
			be held to be outside the amending power of Parliament. There is also
			<lb />
			another ground on which the validity of this clause can be successfully
			<lb />
			assailed. This clause seeks to convert a controlled Constitution into an
			<lb />
			uncontrolled one by removing the limitation on the amending power of
			<lb />
			Parliament which, as pointed out above, is itself an essential feature of
			<lb />
			the Constitution and it is therefore violative of the basic structure. I
			<lb />
			would in the circumstances hold clause (5) of Article 368, to be
			<lb />
			unconstitutional and void.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			With reference to the same proposition, learned counsel placed reliance
			<lb />
			on Kihoto Hollohan v. Zachillhu 34 . It was submitted, that the acceptance
			<lb />
			of the principle of &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution, resulted in
			<lb />
			limiting the amending power postulated in Article 368.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			According to the learned counsel, it is now accepted, that
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, &quot;rule of law&quot;, &quot;judicial review&quot; and
			<lb />
			&quot;separation of powers&quot; are components of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. In the above view of the matter, provisions relating to
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, would have to be such,
			<lb />
			that the above principles would remain unscathed and intact. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that any action which would have the result of making
			<lb />
			appointment of the Judges to the Supreme Court, and to the High
			<lb />
			Courts, subservient to an agency other than the judiciary itself, namely,
			<lb />
			by allowing the executive or the legislature to participate in their
			<lb />
			selection and appointment, would render the judiciary subservient to
			<lb />
			such authority, and thereby, impinge on the &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			Learned counsel invited the Court&apos;s attention to the 1st Law
			<lb />
			Commission Report on &quot;Reform of Judicial Administration&quot; (14th Report
			<lb />
			of the Law Commission of India, chaired by M.C. Setalvad), wherein it
			<lb />
			was debated, that by enacting Articles 124 and 217, the framers of the
			<lb />
			Constitution had endeavoured to put the Judges of the Supreme Court
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			4.
			<lb />
			Realizing the importance of safeguarding the independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary, the Constitution has provided that a Judge of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court shall be appointed by the President in consultation with the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India and after consultation with such of the other Judges of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court and the High Courts as he may deem necessary. He
			<lb />
			holds office till he attains the age of 65 years and is irremovable except
			<lb />
			on the presentation of an address by each House of Parliament passed by
			<lb />
			a specified majority on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity.
			<lb />
			Thus has the Constitution endeavoured to put Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court above executive control.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			It was submitted, that &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; had been
			<lb />
			held to mean and include, insulation of the higher judiciary from
			<lb />
			executive and legislative control. In this behalf, reference was made to
			<lb />
			Union of India v. Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth 5 , wherein this Court had
			<lb />
			observed:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;50. Now the independence of the judiciary is a fighting faith of our
			<lb />
			Constitution. Fearless justice is a cardinal creed of our founding
			<lb />
			document. It is indeed a part of our ancient tradition which has produced
			<lb />
			great Judges in the past. In England too, from where we have inherited
			<lb />
			our present system of administration of justice in its broad and essential
			<lb />
			features
		</p>
		<item>
			, judicial independence is prized as a basic value and so natural
			<lb />
			and inevitable it has come to be regarded and so ingrained it has become
			<lb />
			in the life and thought of the people that it is now almost taken for
			<lb />
			granted and it would be regarded an act of insanity for any one to think
			<lb />
			otherwise. But this has been accomplished after a long fight culminating
			<lb />
			in the Act of Settlement, 1688. Prior to the enactment of that Act, a
			<lb />
			Judge in England held tenure at the pleasure of the Crown and the
			<lb />
			Sovereign could dismiss a Judge at his discretion, if the Judge did not
			<lb />
			deliver judgments to his liking. No less illustrious a Judge than Lord
			<lb />
			Coke was dismissed by Charles I for his glorious and courageous refusal
			<lb />
			to obey the King&apos;s writ de non procedendo rege inconsulto commanding
			<lb />
			him to step or to delay proceedings in his Court. The Act of Settlement,
			<lb />
			1688 put it out of the power of the Sovereign to dismiss a Judge at
			<lb />
			pleasure by substituting &apos;tenure during good behaviour&apos; for &apos;tenure at
			<lb />
			pleasure&apos;. The Judge could then say, as did Lord Bowen so eloquently:
			<lb />
			These are not days in which any English Judge will fail to assert his right
			<lb />
			to rise in the proud consciousness that justice is administered in the
			<lb />
			realms of Her Majesty the Queen, immaculate, unspotted, and
			<lb />
			unsuspected. There is no human being whose smile or frown, there is no
			<lb />
			Government, Tory or Liberal, whose favour or disfavour can start the
			<lb />
			pulse of an English Judge upon the Bench, or move by one hair&apos;s breadth
			<lb />
			the even equipoise of the scales of justice.
			<lb />
			The framers of our Constitution were aware of these constitutional
			<lb />
			developments in England and they were conscious of our great tradition
			<lb />
			of judicial independence and impartiality and they realised that the need
			<lb />
			for securing the independence of the judiciary was even greater under
			<lb />
			our Constitution than it was in England, because ours is a federal or
			<lb />
			quasi-federal Constitution which confers fundamental rights, enacts
			<lb />
			other constitutional limitations and arms the Supreme Court and the
			<lb />
			High Courts with the power of judicial review and consequently the Union
			<lb />
			of India and the States would become the largest single litigants before
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court and the High Courts. Justice, as pointed out by this
			<lb />
			Court in Shamsher Singh v. State of Punjab, (1974) 2 SCC 831, can
			<lb />
			become &quot;fearless and free only if institutional immunity and autonomy
			<lb />
			are guaranteed&quot;. The Constitution-makers, therefore, enacted several
			<lb />
			provisions designed to secure the independence of the superior judiciary
			<lb />
			by insulating it from executive or legislative control. I shall briefly refer to
			<lb />
			these provisions to show how great was the anxiety of the
			<lb />
			constitution-makers to ensure the independence of the superior judiciary
			<lb />
			and with what meticulous care they made provisions to that end.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			In continuation of the instant submission, learned counsel placed
			<lb />
			reliance on the Second Judges case, and drew our attention to the
			<lb />
			following observations recorded by S. Ratnavel Pandian, J.:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;54. Having regard to the importance of this concept the Framers of our
			<lb />
			Constitution having before them the views of the Federal Court and of the
			<lb />
			High Court have said in a memorandum:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;We have assumed that it is recognised on all hands that the
			<lb />
			independence and integrity of the judiciary in a democratic system of
			<lb />
			government is of the highest importance and interest not only to the
			<lb />
			judges but to the citizens at large who may have to seek redress in the
			<lb />
			last resort in courts of law against any illegal acts or the high-handed
			<lb />
			exercise of power by the executive … in making the following proposals
			<lb />
			and suggestions, the paramount importance of securing the fearless
			<lb />
			functioning of an independent and efficient judiciary has been steadily
			<lb />
			kept in view. (vide B. Shiva Rao: The Framing of India&apos;s Constitution,
			<lb />
			Volume I-B, p. 196)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			55. In this context, we may make it clear by borrowing the inimitable
			<lb />
			words of Justice Krishna Iyer, &quot;Independence of the judiciary is not
			<lb />
			genuflexion, nor is it opposition of Government&quot;. Vide Mainstream -
			<lb />
			November 22, 1980 and at one point of time Justice Krishna Iyer
			<lb />
			characterised this concept as a &quot;Constitutional Religion&quot;.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			56. Indisputably, this concept of independence of judiciary which is
			<lb />
			inextricably linked and connected with the constitutional process related
			<lb />
			to the functioning of judiciary is a &quot;fixed-star&quot; in our constitutional
			<lb />
			consultation and its voice centres around the philosophy of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. The basic postulate of this concept is to have a more
			<lb />
			effective judicial system with its full vigour and vitality so as to secure
			<lb />
			and strengthen the imperative confidence of the people in the
			<lb />
			administration of justice. It is only with the object of successfully
			<lb />
			achieving this principle and salvaging much of the problems concerning
			<lb />
			the present judicial system, it is inter alia, contended that in the matter
			<lb />
			of appointment of Judges to the High Courts and Supreme Court
			<lb />
			&apos;primacy&apos; to the opinion of the CJI which is only a facet of this concept,
			<lb />
			should be accorded so that the independence of judiciary is firmly
			<lb />
			secured and protected and the hyperbolic executive intrusion to impose
			<lb />
			its own selectee on the superior judiciary is effectively controlled and
			<lb />
			curbed.&quot;
			<lb />
			And from the same judgment, reference was made to the following
			<lb />
			observations of Kuldip Singh, J.:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;335. Then the question which comes up for consideration is, can there
			<lb />
			be an independent judiciary when the power of appointment of judges
			<lb />
			vests in the executive? To say yes, would be illogical. The independence of
			<lb />
			judiciary is inextricably linked and connected with the constitutional
			<lb />
			process of appointment of judges of the higher judiciary. &apos;Independence of
			<lb />
			Judiciary&apos; is the basic feature of our Constitution and if it means what we
			<lb />
			have discussed above, then the Framers of the Constitution could have
			<lb />
			never intended to give this power to the executive. Even otherwise the
			<lb />
			Governments -Central or the State -are parties before the Courts in
			<lb />
			large number of cases. The Union Executive have vital interests in
			<lb />
			various important matters which come for adjudication before the Apex
			<lb />
			Court. The executive -in one form or the other -is the largest single
			<lb />
			litigant before the courts. In this view of the matter the judiciary being
			<lb />
			the mediator -between the people and the executive -the Framers of the
			<lb />
			Constitution could not have left the final authority to appoint the Judges
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the hands of the
			<lb />
			executive. This Court in S.P. Gupta v. Union of India, 1981 Supp SCC 87
			<lb />
			proceeded on the assumption that the independence of judiciary is the
			<lb />
			basic feature of the Constitution but failed to appreciate that the
			<lb />
			interpretation, it gave, was not in conformity with broader facets of the
			<lb />
			two concepts -&apos;independence of judiciary&apos; and &apos;judicial review&apos; -which are
			<lb />
			interlinked.&quot;
			<lb />
			Based on the above conclusions, it was submitted, that &quot;independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary&quot; could be maintained, only if appointments of Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, were made by according primacy to the opinion of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice, based on the decision of a collegium of Judges. Only then,
			<lb />
			the executive and legislative intrusion, could be effectively controlled and
			<lb />
			curbed.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			Learned counsel, then ventured to make a reference to the
			<lb />
			frequently quoted speech of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar (in the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly on 24.5.1949). It was submitted, that the above speech was
			<lb />
			duly considered in the Second Judges case, wherein this Court
			<lb />
			concluded as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;389. Having held that the primacy in the matter of appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges to the superior courts vests with the judiciary, the crucial
			<lb />
			question which arises for consideration is whether the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, under the Constitution, acts as a &quot;persona designata&quot; or as the
			<lb />
			leader -spokesman for the judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			390. The constitutional scheme does not give primacy to any individual.
			<lb />
			Article 124(2) provides consultation with the Chief Justice of India,
			<lb />
			Judges of the Supreme Court and Judges of the High Courts. Likewise
			<lb />
			Article 217(1) talks of Chief Justice of India and the Chief Justice of the
			<lb />
			High Court. Plurality of consultations has been clearly indicated by the
			<lb />
			Framers of the Constitution. On first reading one gets the impression as
			<lb />
			if the Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts have not been
			<lb />
			included in the process of consultation under Article 217(1) but on a
			<lb />
			closer scrutiny of the constitutional scheme one finds that this was not
			<lb />
			the intention of the Framers of the Constitution. There is no justification,
			<lb />
			whatsoever, for excluding the puisne Judges of the Supreme Court and of
			<lb />
			the High Court from the &quot;consultee zone&quot; under Article 217(1) of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			391. According to Mr Nariman it would not be a strained construction to
			<lb />
			construe the expressions &quot;Chief Justice of India&quot; and &quot;Chief Justice of the
			<lb />
			High Courts&quot; in the sense of the collectivity of Judges, the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			as represented by the Chief Justice of India and all the High Courts (of
			<lb />
			the States concerned) as represented by the Chief Justice of
		</p>
		<item>
			the High
			<lb />
			Court. A bare reading of Articles 124(2) and 217(1) makes it clear that the
			<lb />
			Framers of the Constitution did not intend to leave the final word, in the
			<lb />
			matter of appointment of Judges to the superior Courts, in the hands of
			<lb />
			any individual howsoever high he is placed in the constitutional
			<lb />
			hierarchy. Collective wisdom of the consultees is the sine qua non for
			<lb />
			such appointments. Dr B.R. Ambedkar in his speech dated May 24, 1949
			<lb />
			in the Constituent Assembly explaining the scope of the draft articles
			<lb />
			pertaining to the appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court …
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			392. Dr Ambedkar did not see any difficulty in the smooth operation of
			<lb />
			the constitutional provisions concerning the appointment of Judges to
			<lb />
			the superior Courts. Having entrusted the work to high constitutional
			<lb />
			functionaries the Framers of the Constitution felt assured that such
			<lb />
			appointments would always be made by consensus. It is the functioning
			<lb />
			of the Constitution during the past more than four decades which has
			<lb />
			brought the necessity of considering the question of primacy in the
			<lb />
			matter of such appointments. Once we hold that the primacy lies with
			<lb />
			the judiciary, then it is the judiciary as collectivity which has the primal
			<lb />
			say and not any individual, not even the Chief Justice of India. If we
			<lb />
			interpret the expression &quot;the Chief Justice of India&quot; as a &quot;persona
			<lb />
			designata&quot; then it would amount &quot;to allow the Chief Justice practically
			<lb />
			veto upon the appointment of Judges&quot; which the Framers of the
			<lb />
			Constitution in the words of Dr Ambedkar never intended to do. We are,
			<lb />
			therefore, of the view that the expressions &quot;the Chief Justice of India&quot; and
			<lb />
			the &quot;Chief Justice of the High Court&quot; in Articles 124(2) and 217(1) of the
			<lb />
			Constitution mean the said judicial functionaries as representatives of
			<lb />
			their respective courts.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			In conjunction with the observations extracted hereinabove, the Court&apos;s
			<lb />
			attention was also invited to the following further conclusions:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;466. It has to be borne in mind that the principle of non-arbitrariness
			<lb />
			which is an essential attribute of the rule of law is all pervasive
			<lb />
			throughout the Constitution; and an adjunct of this principle is the
			<lb />
			absence of absolute power in one individual in any sphere of
			<lb />
			constitutional activity. The possibility of intrusion of arbitrariness has to
			<lb />
			be kept in view, and eschewed, in constitutional interpretation and,
			<lb />
			therefore, the meaning of the opinion of the Chief Justice of India, in the
			<lb />
			context of primacy, must be ascertained. A homogenous mixture, which
			<lb />
			accords with the constitutional purpose and its ethos, indicates that it is
			<lb />
			the opinion of the judiciary &apos;symbolised by the view of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India&apos; which is given greater significance or primacy in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointments. In other words, the view of the Chief Justice of India is to
			<lb />
			be expressed in the consultative process as truly reflective of the opinion
			<lb />
			of the judiciary, which means that it must necessarily have the element
			<lb />
			of plurality in its formation. In actual practice, this is how the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India does, and is expected to function so that the final opinion
			<lb />
			expressed by him is not merely his individual opinion, but the collective
			<lb />
			opinion formed after taking into account the views of some other Judges
			<lb />
			who are traditionally associated with this function.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			467. In view of the primacy of judiciary in this process, the question next,
			<lb />
			is of the modality for achieving this purpose. The indication in the
			<lb />
			constitutional provisions is found from the reference to the office of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India, which has been named for achieving this object in
			<lb />
			a pragmatic manner. The opinion of the judiciary &apos;symbolised by the view
			<lb />
			of the Chief Justice of India&apos;, is to be obtained by consultation with the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India; and it is this opinion which has primacy.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			468. The rule of law envisages the area of discretion to be the minimum,
			<lb />
			requiring only the application of known principles or guidelines to ensure
			<lb />
			non-arbitrariness, but to that limited extent, discretion is a pragmatic
			<lb />
			need. Conferring discretion upon high functionaries and, whenever
			<lb />
			feasible, introducing the element of plurality by requiring a collective
			<lb />
			decision, are further checks against arbitrariness. This is how idealism
			<lb />
			and pragmatism are reconciled and integrated, to make the system
			<lb />
			workable in a satisfactory manner. Entrustment of the task of
			<lb />
			appointment of superior judges to high constitutional functionaries; the
			<lb />
			greatest significance attached to the view of the Chief Justice of India,
			<lb />
			who is best equipped to assess the true worth of the candidates for
			<lb />
			adjudging their suitability; the opinion of the Chief Justice of India being
			<lb />
			the collective opinion formed after taking into account the views of some
			<lb />
			of his colleagues; and the executive being permitted to prevent an
			<lb />
			appointment considered to be unsuitable, for strong reasons disclosed to
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India, provide the best method, in the constitutional
			<lb />
			scheme, to achieve the constitutional purpose without conferring
			<lb />
			absolute discretion or veto upon either the judiciary or the executive,
			<lb />
			much less in any individual, be he the Chief Justice of India or the Prime
			<lb />
			Minister.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			10. It was the emphatic contention of the learned counsel, that the
			<lb />
			conclusions recorded by this Court in the Second Judges case, had been
			<lb />
			accepted by the executive and the legislature. It was acknowledged, that
			<lb />
			in the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, primacy
			<lb />
			would vest with the judiciary, and further that, the opinion of the
			<lb />
			judiciary would have an element of plurality. This assertion was sought
			<lb />
			to be further established, by placing reliance on the Third Judges case.
			<lb />
			It was submitted, that the conclusions of the majority judgment, in the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case, were reproduced in paragraph 9 of the Third Judges
			<lb />
			case, and thereupon, this Court recorded the statement of the then
			<lb />
			Attorney General, that through the Presidential Reference, the Union of
			<lb />
			India was not seeking, a review or reconsideration, of the judgment in the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case. And that, the Union of India had accepted the above
			<lb />
			majority judgment, as binding. In this context, paragraphs 10 to 12 of
			<lb />
			the Third Judges case, which were relied upon, are being reproduced
			<lb />
			below:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;10. We have heard the learned Attorney General, learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			interveners and some of the High Courts and the Advocates General of
			<lb />
			some States.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			11. We record at the outset the statements of the Attorney General that
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			( 1 ) the Union of India is not seeking a review or reconsideration of the
			<lb />
			judgment in the Second Judges case (1993) 4 SCC 441 and that ( 2 ) the
			<lb />
			Union of India shall accept and treat as binding the answers of this Court
			<lb />
			to the questions set out in the Reference.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			12. The majority view in the Second Judges case (1993) 4 SCC 441 is
			<lb />
			that in the matter of appointments to the Supreme Court and the High
			<lb />
			Courts, the opinion of the Chief Justice of India has primacy. The opinion
			<lb />
			of the Chief Justice of India is &quot;reflective of the opinion of the judiciary,
			<lb />
			which means that it must necessarily have the element of plurality in its
			<lb />
			formation&quot;. It is to be formed &quot;after taking into account the view of some
			<lb />
			other Judges who are traditionally associated with this function&quot;. The
			<lb />
			opinion of the Chief Justice of India &quot;so given has primacy in the matter
			<lb />
			of all appointments&quot;. For an appointment to be made, it has to be &quot;in
			<lb />
			conformity with the final opinion of the Chief Justice of India formed in
			<lb />
			the manner indicated&quot;. It must follow that an opinion formed by the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India in any manner other than that indicated has no primacy
			<lb />
			in the matter of appointments to the Supreme Court and the High Courts
			<lb />
			and the Government is not obliged to act thereon.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			11. Learned counsel invited the Court&apos;s attention, to the third
			<lb />
			conclusion drawn in Madras Bar Association v. Union of India 35 , which is
			<lb />
			placed below:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;136.(iii) The &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution will stand violated if
			<lb />
			while enacting legislation pertaining to transfer of judicial power,
			<lb />
			Parliament does not ensure that the newly created court/tribunal
			<lb />
			conforms with the salient characteristics and standards of the court
			<lb />
			sought to be substituted.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Learned counsel then asserted, that the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution would stand violated if, in amending the Constitution
			<lb />
			and/or enacting legislation, Parliament does not ensure, that the body
			<lb />
			newly created, conformed with the salient characteristics and the
			<lb />
			standards of the body sought to be substituted. It was asserted, that the
			<lb />
			salient features of the existing process of appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, which had stood the test of time, could validly and
			<lb />
			constitutionally be replaced, but while substituting the prevailing
			<lb />
			procedure, the salient characteristics which existed earlier, had to be
			<lb />
			preserved. By placing reliance on Articles 124 and 217, it was asserted,
			<lb />
			that the above provisions, as originally enacted, were explained by
			<lb />
			decisions of this Court, starting from 1974 in Samsher Singh v. State of
			<lb />
			Punjab 11 , followed by the Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth case 5 in 1977, and
			<lb />
			the Second Judges case in 1993, and finally endorsed in 1998 by the
			<lb />
			Third Judges case. It was submitted, that four Constitution Benches of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court, had only affirmed the practice followed by the
			<lb />
			executive since 1950 (when the people of this country, agreed to be
			<lb />
			governed by the Constitution). It was pointed out, that the process of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, had continued to remain a
			<lb />
			participatory consultative process, wherein the initiation of the proposal
			<lb />
			for appointment of a Judge to the Supreme Court, was by the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India; and in the case of appointment of Judges to High
			<lb />
			Courts, by the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court. And that, for
			<lb />
			transfer of a Judge/Chief Justice of a High Court, to another High Court,
			<lb />
			the proposal was initiated by the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
			It was
			<lb />
			contended, that in the process of taking a decision on the above matters
			<lb />
			(of appointment and transfer), the opinion of the judiciary was
			<lb />
			symbolized through the Chief Justice of India, and the same was based
			<lb />
			on the decision of a collegium of Judges, since 1993 -when the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case was decided. The only exception to the above rule, according
			<lb />
			to learned counsel, was when the executive, based on stated strong
			<lb />
			cogent reasons (disclosed to the Chief Justice of India), felt otherwise.
			<lb />
			However, if the stated reasons, as were disclosed to the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, were not accepted, the decision of a collegium of Judges on
			<lb />
			reiteration, would result in the proposed appointment/transfer. This,
			<lb />
			according to learned counsel, constituted the earlier procedure under
			<lb />
			Articles 124 and 217. The aforesaid procedure, was considered as
			<lb />
			sufficient, to preserve the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			12. According to learned counsel, it needed to be determined, whether
			<lb />
			the NJAC now set up, had the same or similar characteristics, in the
			<lb />
			matter of appointments/transfers, which would preserve the
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;? Answering the query, learned counsel
			<lb />
			was emphatic, that the primacy of the judiciary, had been totally eroded
			<lb />
			through the impugned constitutional amendment. For the above, learned
			<lb />
			counsel invited our attention to Article 124A inserted by the Constitution
			<lb />
			(99th Amendment) Act. It was submitted, that the NJAC contemplated
			<lb />
			under Article 124A would comprise of six Members, namely, the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, two senior Judges of the Supreme Court (next to the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice), the Union Minister in charge of Law and Justice, and two
			<lb />
			&quot;eminent persons&quot;. It was submitted, that the judges component, which
			<lb />
			had the primacy (and in a manner of understanding -unanimity), under
			<lb />
			the erstwhile procedure, had now been reduced to half-strength, in the
			<lb />
			selecting body -the NJAC. It was pointed out, that the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, would now have an equivalent voting right, as the other Members
			<lb />
			of the NJAC. It was submitted, that even though the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India would be the Chairman of the NJAC, he has no casting vote, in the
			<lb />
			event of a tie. It was submitted, that under the substituted procedure,
			<lb />
			even if the Chief Justice of India, and the two other senior Judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court (next to the Chief Justice of India), supported the
			<lb />
			appointment/transfer of an individual, the same could be negatived, by
			<lb />
			any two Members of the NJAC. Even by the two &quot;eminent persons&quot; who
			<lb />
			may have no direct or indirect nexus with the process of administration
			<lb />
			of justice. It was therefore submitted, that the primacy vested with the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India had been fully and completely eroded.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			13. With reference to the subject of primacy of the judiciary, it was
			<lb />
			asserted, that under the system sought to be substituted, the proposal
			<lb />
			for appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court, could only have been
			<lb />
			initiated by the Chief Justice of India. And likewise, the proposal for
			<lb />
			transfer of a Judge or the Chief Justice of a High Court, could only have
			<lb />
			been initiated by the Chief Justice of India. And likewise, the proposal
			<lb />
			for appointment of a Judge to a High Court, could only have been
			<lb />
			initiated by the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court. In order to
			<lb />
			demonstrate the changed position, learned counsel placed reliance on
			<lb />
			Article 124B introduced by the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act,
			<lb />
			whereunder, the authority to initiate the process, had now been vested
			<lb />
			with the NJAC. Under the new dispensation, the NJAC alone would
			<lb />
			recommend persons for appointment as Judges to the higher judiciary.
			<lb />
			It was also apparent, according to learned counsel, that the NJAC has
			<lb />
			now been bestowed with the exclusive responsibility to recommend
			<lb />
			transfers of Chief Justices and Judges of High Courts. Having described
			<lb />
			the aforesaid alteration as a total subversion of the prevailing procedure,
			<lb />
			which had stood the test of time, and had secured the independence of
			<lb />
			the process of appointment and transfer of Judges of the higher judiciary,
			<lb />
			it was pointed out, that the Parliament had not disclosed the reasons,
			<lb />
			why the primacy of the Chief Justice of India and the other senior
			<lb />
			Judges, had to be dispensed with. Or for that matter, why the prevailing
			<lb />
			procedure needed to be altered. It was further the contention of learned
			<lb />
			counsel, that the non-disclosure of reasons, must inevitably lead to the
			<lb />
			inference, that there were no such reasons.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			14. Dr. Rajeev Dhavan, learned senior counsel, also advanced
			<lb />
			submissions, with reference to the &quot;basic structure&quot;, and the scope of
			<lb />
			amending the provisions of the Constitution. Dwelling upon the power of
			<lb />
			Parliament to amend the Constitution, it was submitted, that this Court
			<lb />
			in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala 10 , had declared, that the &quot;basic
			<lb />
			structure&quot; of the Constitution, was not susceptible or amenable to
			<lb />
			amendment. Inviting our attention to Article 368, it was submitted, that
			<lb />
			the power vested with the Parliament to amend the Constitution,
			<lb />
			contemplated the extension of the constituent power, which was
			<lb />
			exercised by the Constituent Assembly, while framing the Constitution.
			<lb />
			It was pointed out, that in exercise of the above power, the Parliament
			<lb />
			had been permitted to discharge the same role as the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly. The provisions of the Constitution, it was asserted, could be
			<lb />
			amended, to keep pace with developments in the civil society, so long as
			<lb />
			the amendment was not in violation of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. It was submitted, that it was not enough, in the facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of the present case, to determine the validity of the
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment in question, by limiting the examination to a
			<lb />
			determination, whether or not the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; stood
			<lb />
			breached, on a plain reading of the provisions sought to be amended. It
			<lb />
			was asserted, that it was imperative to take into consideration,
			<lb />
			judgments rendered by this Court, on the subject. It was asserted, that
			<lb />
			this Court was liable to examine the declared position of law, in the First,
			<lb />
			Second and Third Judges cases, insofar as the present controversy was
			<lb />
			concerned. According to learned counsel, if the enactments under
			<lb />
			challenge, were found to be in breach of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, as declared in the above judgments, the impugned
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment, as also, the legislation under reference, would
			<lb />
			undoubtedly be constitutionally invalid.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			15. In the above context, learned counsel pointed out, that with
			<lb />
			reference to an amendment to the fundamental right(s), enshrined in Part
			<lb />
			III of the Constitution, guidelines were laid down by this Court in M.
			<lb />
			Nagaraj v. Union of India 36 , as also, in the Kihoto Hollohan case 34 . It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the change through the impugned amendment to the
			<lb />
			Constitution, (and by the NJAC Act) was not a peripheral change, but
			<lb />
			was a substantial one, which was also seemingly irreversible. And
			<lb />
			therefore, according to learned counsel, its validity would have to be
			<lb />
			determined, on the basis of the width and the identity tests. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the width and the identity tests were different from the
			<lb />
			tests applicable for determining the validity of ordinary parliamentary
			<lb />
			legislation, or a constitutional amendment relating to fundamental rights.
			<lb />
			The manner of working out the width and the identity tests, it was
			<lb />
			submitted, had been laid down in the M. Nagaraj case 36 , wherein this
			<lb />
			Court held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;9. On behalf of the respondents, the following arguments were
			<lb />
			advanced. The power of amendment under Article 368 is a &quot;constituent&quot;
			<lb />
			power and not a &quot;constituted power&quot;; that, that there are no implied
			<lb />
			limitations on the constituent power under Article 368; that, the power
			<lb />
			under Article 368 has to keep the Constitution in repair as and when it
			<lb />
			becomes necessary and thereby protect and preserve the basic structure.
			<lb />
			In such process of amendment, if it destroys the basic feature of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, the amendment will be unconstitutional. The Constitution,
			<lb />
			according to the respondents, is not merely what it says. It is what the
			<lb />
			last interpretation of the relevant provision of the Constitution given by
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court which prevails as a law. The interpretation placed on
			<lb />
			the Constitution by the Court becomes part of the Constitution and,
			<lb />
			therefore, it is open to amendment under Article 368. An interpretation
			<lb />
			placed by the Court on any provision of the Constitution gets inbuilt in
			<lb />
			the provisions interpreted. Such articles are capable of amendment
			<lb />
			under Article 368. Such change of the law so declared by the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court will not merely for that reason alone violate the basic structure of
			<lb />
			the Constitution or amount to usurpation of judicial power. This is how
			<lb />
			the Constitution becomes dynamic. Law has to change. It requires
			<lb />
			amendments to the Constitution according to the needs of time and
			<lb />
			needs of society. It is an ongoing process of judicial and constituent
			<lb />
			powers, both contributing to change of law with the final say in the
			<lb />
			judiciary to pronounce on the validity of such change of law effected by
			<lb />
			the constituent power by examining whether such amendments violate
			<lb />
			the basic structure of the Constitution. On every occasion when a
			<lb />
			constitutional matter comes before the Court, the meaning of the
			<lb />
			provisions of the Constitution will call for interpretation, but every
			<lb />
			interpretation of the article does not become a basic feature of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. That, there are no implied limitations on the power of
			<lb />
			Parliament under Article 368 when it seeks to amend the Constitution.
			<lb />
			However, an amendment will be invalid, if it interferes with or
			<lb />
			undermines the basic structure. The validity of the amendment is not to
			<lb />
			be decided on the touchstone of Article 13 but only on the basis of
			<lb />
			violation of the basic features of the Constitution.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			16. It was submitted, that whilst the Parliament had the power to
			<lb />
			amend the Constitution; the legislature (-or the executive), had no power
			<lb />
			to either interpret the Constitution, or to determine the validity of an
			<lb />
			amendment to the provisions of the Constitution. The power to determine
			<lb />
			the validity of a constitutional amendment, according to learned counsel,
			<lb />
			exclusively rests with the higher judiciary. Every amendment had to be
			<lb />
			tested on the touchstone of &quot;basic structure&quot; -as declared by the
			<lb />
			judiciary. It was submitted, that the aforesaid power vested with the
			<lb />
			judiciary, could not be withdrawn or revoked. This, according to learned
			<lb />
			counsel, constituted the fundamental judicial power, and was no less
			<lb />
			significant/weighty than the legislative power of Parliament. The
			<lb />
			importance of the power of judicial review vested with the higher judiciary
			<lb />
			(to examine the validity of executive and legislative actions), bestowed
			<lb />
			superiority to the judiciary over the other two pillars of governance. This
			<lb />
			position, it was pointed out, was critical to balance the power
			<lb />
			surrendered by the civil society, in favour of the political and the
			<lb />
			executive sovereignty.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			17. In order to determine the validity of the submissions advanced on
			<lb />
			behalf of the petitioners, we were informed, that the interpretation placed
			<lb />
			by the Supreme Court on Articles 124 and 217 (as they existed, prior to
			<lb />
			the impugned amendment), would have to be kept in mind. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the term &quot;consultation&quot; with reference to Article 124, had
			<lb />
			been understood as conferring primacy with the judiciary. Therefore,
			<lb />
			while examining the impugned constitutional amendment to Article 124,
			<lb />
			it was imperative for this Court, to understand the term &quot;consultation&quot; in
			<lb />
			Article 124, and to read it as, conferring primacy in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges, with the judiciary. Under Article 124, according
			<lb />
			to learned counsel, the President was not required to merely &quot;consult&quot; the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India, but the executive was to accede to the view
			<lb />
			expressed by the Chief Justice of India. Insofar as the term &quot;Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India&quot; is concerned, it was submitted, that the same had also
			<lb />
			been understood to mean, not the individual opinion of the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India, but the opinion of the judiciary symbolized through the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India. Accordingly, it was emphasized, that the individual
			<lb />
			opinion of the Chief Justice (with reference to Articles 124 and 217) was
			<lb />
			understood as the institutional opinion of the judiciary. Accordingly,
			<lb />
			whilst examining the impugned constitutional amendment, under the
			<lb />
			width and the identity test(s), the above declared legal position, had to be
			<lb />
			kept in mind while determining, whether or not the impugned
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment, and the impugned legislative enactment, had
			<lb />
			breached the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			18. It was contended, that the judgment in the Second Judges case,
			<lb />
			should be accepted as the touchstone, by which the validity of the
			<lb />
			impugned constitutional amendment (and the NJAC Act), must be
			<lb />
			examined. It was submitted, that the power exercised by the Parliament
			<lb />
			under Article 368, in giving effect to the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment (and by enacting the NJAC Act), will have to be tested in a
			<lb />
			manner, that will allow an organic adaptation to the changing times, and
			<lb />
			at the same time ensure, that the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution
			<lb />
			was not violated. Relying on the M. Nagaraj case 36 , the Court&apos;s attention
			<lb />
			was drawn to the following observations:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;18. The key issue, which arises for determination in this case is-whether
			<lb />
			by virtue of the impugned constitutional amendments, the power of
			<lb />
			Parliament is so enlarged so as to obliterate any or all of the
			<lb />
			constitutional limitations and requirements?
			<lb />
			Standards of judicial review of constitutional amendments
			<lb />
			19. The Constitution is not an ephemeral legal document embodying a
			<lb />
			set of legal rules for the passing hour. It sets out principles for an
			<lb />
			expanding future and is intended to endure for ages to come and
			<lb />
			consequently to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.
			<lb />
			Therefore, a purposive rather than a strict literal approach to the
			<lb />
			interpretation should be adopted. A constitutional provision must be
			<lb />
			construed not in a narrow and constricted sense but in a wide and liberal
			<lb />
			manner so as to anticipate and take account of changing conditions and
			<lb />
			purposes so that a constitutional provision does not get fossilised but
			<lb />
			remains flexible enough to meet the newly emerging problems and
			<lb />
			challenges.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Learned senior counsel, also drew the Court&apos;s attention to similar
			<lb />
			observations recorded in the Second Judges case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19. Learned counsel was emphatic, that the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment (and the provisions of the NJAC Act), if approved, would
			<lb />
			remain in place for ten…, twenty…, thirty or even forty years, and
			<lb />
			therefore, need to be viewed closely and objectively. The provisions will
			<lb />
			have to be interpreted in a manner, that the &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot; would not be compromised. It was submitted, that if the
			<lb />
			impugned provisions were to be declared as constitutionally valid, there
			<lb />
			would be no means hereafter, to restore the &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			20. According to learned counsel, the question was of the purity of the
			<lb />
			justice delivery system. The question was about the maintenance of
			<lb />
			judicial standards. All these questions emerged from the fountainhead,
			<lb />
			namely, the manner of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary.
			<lb />
			The provisions of Article 124, it was pointed out, as it existed prior to the
			<lb />
			impugned amendment, had provided for a system of trusteeship, wherein
			<lb />
			institutional predominance of the judiciary was the hallmark. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the aforesaid trusteeship should not be permitted to be
			<lb />
			shared by those, whose rival claims arose for consideration before Courts
			<lb />
			of law. The judicial responsibility in the matter of appointment of Judges,
			<lb />
			according to learned counsel, being the most important trusteeship,
			<lb />
			could not be permitted to be shared, with either the executive or the
			<lb />
			legislature.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			21. Referring to the amendment itself, it was contended, that merely
			<lb />
			changing the basis of the legislation, would not be the correct test to
			<lb />
			evaluate the actions of the Parliament, in the present controversy. It was
			<lb />
			likewise submitted, that reasonableness and proportionality were also
			<lb />
			not the correct test(s) to be applied. According to learned counsel, in
			<lb />
			order to determine the validity of the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment (and the NJAC Act), the Union of India and the ratifying
			<lb />
			States will have to bear the onus of satisfactorily establishing, that the
			<lb />
			amended provisions, could under no circumstances, be used (actually
			<lb />
			misused) to subvert the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. Placing reliance
			<lb />
			on the M. Nagaraj case 36 , the Court&apos;s attention was invited to the
			<lb />
			following observations:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;22. The question which arises before us is regarding the nature of the
			<lb />
			standards of judicial review required to be applied in judging the validity
			<lb />
			of the constitutional amendments in the context of the doctrine of basic
			<lb />
			structure. The concept of a basic structure giving coherence and
			<lb />
			durability to a Constitution has a certain intrinsic force. This doctrine
			<lb />
			has essentially developed from the German Constitution. This
			<lb />
			development is the emergence of the constitutional principles in their
			<lb />
			own right. It is not based on literal wordings.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			23. …..In S.R. Bommai (1994) 3 SCC 1 the Court clearly based its
			<lb />
			conclusion not so much on violation of particular constitutional
			<lb />
			provisions but on this generalised ground i.e. evidence of a pattern of
			<lb />
			action directed against the principle of secularism. Therefore, it is
			<lb />
			important to note that the recognition of a basic structure in the context
			<lb />
			of amendment provides an insight that there are, beyond the words of
			<lb />
			particular provisions, systematic principles underlying and connecting
			<lb />
			the provisions of the Constitution. These principles give coherence to the
			<lb />
			Constitution and make it an organic whole. These principles are part of
			<lb />
			constitutional law even if they are not expressly stated in the form of
			<lb />
			rules. An instance is the principle of reasonableness which connects
			<lb />
			Articles 14, 19 and 21. Some of these principles may be so important and
			<lb />
			fundamental, as to qualify as &quot;essential features&quot; or part of the &quot;basic
			<lb />
			structure&quot; of the Constitution, that is to say, they are not open to
			<lb />
			amendment. However, it is only by linking provisions to such overarching
			<lb />
			principles that one would be able to distinguish essential from less
			<lb />
			essential features of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />

			<lb />

			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			25. For a constitutional principle to qualify as an essential feature, it
			<lb />
			must be established that the said principle is a part of the constitutional
			<lb />
			law binding on the legislature. Only thereafter, is the second step to be
			<lb />
			taken, namely, whether the principle is so fundamental as to bind even
			<lb />
			the amending power of Parliament i.e. to form a part of the basic
			<lb />
			structure. The basic structure concept accordingly limits the amending
			<lb />
			power of Parliament. To sum up: in order to qualify as an essential
			<lb />
			feature, a principle is to be first established as part of the constitutional
			<lb />
			law and as such binding on the legislature. Only then, can it be
			<lb />
			examined whether it is so fundamental as to bind even the amending
			<lb />
			power of Parliament i.e. to form part of the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. This is the standard of judicial review of constitutional
			<lb />
			amendments in the context of the doctrine of basic structure.
			<lb />

			<lb />

			<lb />

			<lb />
			30. Constitutional adjudication is like no other decision-making. There is
			<lb />
			a moral dimension to every major constitutional case; the language of the
			<lb />
			text is not necessarily a controlling factor. Our Constitution works
			<lb />
			because of its generalities, and because of the good sense of the judges
			<lb />
			when interpreting it. It is that informed freedom of action of the judges
			<lb />
			that helps to preserve and protect our basic document of governance.

			35. The theory of basic structure is based on the principle that a change
			<lb />
			in a thing does not involve its destruction and destruction of a thing is a
			<lb />
			matter of substance and not of form. Therefore, one has to apply the test
			<lb />
			of overarching principle to be gathered from the scheme and the
			<lb />
			placement and the structure of an article in the Constitution. For
			<lb />
			example, the placement of Article 14 in the equality code; the placement
			<lb />
			of Article 19 in the freedom code; the placement of Article 32 in the code
			<lb />
			giving access to the Supreme Court. Therefore, the theory of basic
			<lb />
			structure is the only theory by which the validity of impugned
			<lb />
			amendments to the Constitution is to be judged.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			22. Referring to the position expressed by this Court, learned counsel
			<lb />
			submitted, that the overarching principle for this Court, was to first keep
			<lb />
			in its mind, the exact nature of the amendment contemplated through
			<lb />
			the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act. And the second step was, to
			<lb />
			determine how fundamental the amended provision was. For this,
			<lb />
			reliance was again placed on the M. Nagaraj case 36 , and our attention
			<lb />
			was drawn to the following conclusions:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;102. In the matter of application of the principle of basic structure, twin
			<lb />
			tests have to be satisfied, namely, the &quot;width test&quot; and the test of
			<lb />
			&quot;identity&quot;. As stated hereinabove, the concept of the &quot;catch-up&quot; rule and
			<lb />
			&quot;consequential seniority&quot; are not constitutional requirements. They are
			<lb />
			not implicit in clauses (1) and (4) of Article 16. They are not
			<lb />
			constitutional limitations. They are concepts derived from service
			<lb />
			jurisprudence. They are not constitutional principles. They are not
			<lb />
			axioms like, secularism, federalism, etc. Obliteration of these concepts or
			<lb />
			insertion of these concepts does not change the equality code indicated
			<lb />
			by Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution. Clause (1) of Article 16
			<lb />
			cannot prevent the State from taking cognizance of the compelling
			<lb />
			interests of Backward Classes in the society. Clauses (1) and (4) of Article
			<lb />
			16 are restatements of the principle of equality under Article 14. Clause
			<lb />
			(4) of Article 16 refers to affirmative action by way of reservation. Clause
			<lb />
			(4) of Article 16, however, states that the appropriate Government is free
			<lb />
			to provide for reservation in cases where it is satisfied on the basis of
			<lb />
			quantifiable data that Backward Class is inadequately represented in the
			<lb />
			services. Therefore, in every case where the State decides to provide for
			<lb />
			reservation there must exist two circumstances, namely, &quot;backwardness&quot;
			<lb />
			and &quot;inadequacy of representation&quot;. As stated above, equity, justice and
			<lb />
			efficiency are variable factors. These factors are context-specific. There is
			<lb />
			no fixed yardstick to identify and measure these three factors, it will
			<lb />
			depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. These are the
			<lb />
			limitations on the mode of the exercise of power by the State. None of
			<lb />
			these limitations have been removed by the impugned amendments. If
			<lb />
			the State concerned fails to identify and measure backwardness,
			<lb />
			inadequacy and overall administrative efficiency then in that event the
			<lb />
			provision for reservation would be invalid. These amendments do not
			<lb />
			alter the structure of Articles 14, 15 and 16 (equity code). The parameters
			<lb />
			mentioned in Article 16(4) are retained. Clause (4-A) is derived from
			<lb />
			clause (4) of Article 16. Clause (4-A) is confined to SCs and STs alone.
			<lb />
			Therefore, the present case does not change the identity of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. The word &quot;amendment&quot; connotes change. The question is-
			<lb />
			whether the impugned amendments discard the original Constitution. It
			<lb />
			was vehemently urged on behalf of the petitioners that the Statement of
			<lb />
			Objects and Reasons indicates that the impugned amendments have
			<lb />
			been promulgated by Parliament to overrule the decisions of this Court.
			<lb />
			We do not find any merit in this argument. Under Article 141 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution the pronouncement of this Court is the law of the land. The
			<lb />
			judgments of this Court in Union of India v. Virpal Singh Chauhan,
			<lb />
			(1995) 6 SCC 684…, Ajit Singh Januja v. State of Punjab, (1996) 2 SCC
			<lb />
			715… , Ajit Singh (II) v. State of Punjab, (1999) 7 SCC 209… and Indra
			<lb />
			Sawhney v. Union of India, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217… were judgments
			<lb />
			delivered by this Court which enunciated the law of the land. It is that
			<lb />
			law which is sought to be changed by the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendments. The impugned constitutional amendments are enabling in
			<lb />
			nature. They leave it to the States to provide for reservation. It is well
			<lb />
			settled that Parliament while enacting a law does not provide content to
			<lb />
			the &quot;right&quot;. The content is provided by the judgments of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court. If the appropriate Government enacts a law providing for
			<lb />
			reservation without keeping in mind the parameters in Article 16(4) and
			<lb />
			Article 335 then this Court will certainly set aside and strike down such
			<lb />
			legislation. Applying the &quot;width test&quot;, we do not find obliteration of any of
			<lb />
			the constitutional limitations. Applying the test of &quot;identity&quot;, we do not
			<lb />
			find any alteration in the existing structure of the equality code. As
			<lb />
			stated above, none of the axioms like secularism, federalism, etc. which
			<lb />
			are overarching principles have been violated by the impugned
			<lb />
			constitutional amendments. Equality has two facets-&quot;formal equality&quot;
			<lb />
			and &quot;proportional equality&quot;. Proportional equality is equality &quot;in fact&quot;
			<lb />
			whereas formal equality is equality &quot;in law&quot;. Formal equality exists in the
			<lb />
			rule of law. In the case of proportional equality the State is expected to
			<lb />
			take affirmative steps in favour of disadvantaged sections of the society
			<lb />
			within the framework of liberal democracy. Egalitarian equality is
			<lb />
			proportional equality.&quot;
			<lb />

			Yet again referring to the width and the identity tests, learned counsel
			<lb />
			emphasized, that it was imperative for this Court, in the facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of the present case, to examine whether the power of
			<lb />
			amendment exercised by the Parliament, was so wide as to make it
			<lb />
			excessive. For the above, reference was made to the Madras Bar
			<lb />
			Association case 35 , wherein this Court recorded the following conclusions:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;134.(i) Parliament has the power to enact legislation and to vest
			<lb />
			adjudicatory functions earlier vested in the High Court with an
			<lb />
			alternative court/tribunal. Exercise of such power by Parliament would
			<lb />
			not per se violate the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			135.(ii) Recognised constitutional conventions pertaining to the
			<lb />
			Westminster model do not debar the legislating authority from enacting
			<lb />
			legislation to vest adjudicatory functions earlier vested in a superior
			<lb />
			court with an alternative court/tribunal. Exercise of such power by
			<lb />
			Parliament would per se not violate any constitutional convention.
			<lb />
			136.(iii) The &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution will stand violated if
			<lb />
			while enacting legislation pertaining to transfer of judicial power,
			<lb />
			Parliament does not ensure that the newly created court/tribunal
			<lb />
			conforms with the salient characteristics and standards of the court
			<lb />
			sought to be substituted.
			<lb />
			137.(iv) Constitutional conventions pertaining to the Constitutions styled
			<lb />
			on the Westminster model will also stand breached, if while enacting
			<lb />
			legislation, pertaining to transfer of judicial power, conventions and
			<lb />
			salient characteristics of the court sought to be replaced are not
			<lb />
			incorporated in the court/tribunal sought to be created.
			<lb />
			138.(v) The prayer made in Writ Petition (C) No. 621 of 2007 is declined.
			<lb />
			Company Secretaries are held ineligible for representing a party to an
			<lb />
			appeal before NTT.
			<lb />
			139.(vi) Examined on the touchstone of Conclusions ( iii ) and ( iv )
			<lb />
			(contained in paras 136 and 137, above) Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 13 of the
			<lb />
			NTT Act (to the extent indicated hereinabove), are held to be
			<lb />
			unconstitutional. Since the aforesaid provisions constitute the edifice of
			<lb />
			the NTT Act, and without these provisions the remaining provisions are
			<lb />
			rendered ineffective and inconsequential, the entire enactment is
			<lb />
			declared unconstitutional.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Based on the above, it was asserted, that this Court had now clearly laid
			<lb />
			down, that on issues pertaining to the transfer of judicial power, the
			<lb />
			salient characteristics, standards and conventions of judicial power,
			<lb />
			could not be breached. It was also submitted, that evaluated by the
			<lb />
			aforesaid standards, it would clearly emerge, that the &quot;independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary&quot; had been seriously compromised, through the impugned
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment (and the NJAC Act).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			23. It was the submission of Mr. Ram Jethmalani, learned Senior
			<lb />
			Advocate, that the defect in the judgment rendered by this Court in the
			<lb />
			First Judges case, was that, Article 50 of the Constitution had not been
			<lb />
			appropriately highlighted, for consideration. It was submitted, that
			<lb />
			importance of Article 50 read with Articles 12 and 36, came to be
			<lb />
			examined in the Second Judges case, wherein the majority view, was as
			<lb />
			follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;80. From the above deliberation, it is clear that Article 50 was referred to
			<lb />
			in various decisions by the eminent Judges of this Court while discussing
			<lb />
			the principle of independence of the judiciary. We may cite Article 36
			<lb />
			which falls under Part IV (Directive Principles of State Policy) and which
			<lb />
			reads thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			36. In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires, &apos;the State&apos; has
			<lb />
			the same meaning as in Part III.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			81. According to this article, the definition of the expression &quot;the State&quot; in
			<lb />
			Article 12 shall apply throughout Part IV, wherever that word is used.
			<lb />
			Therefore, it follows that the expression &quot;the State&quot; used in Article 50 has
			<lb />
			to be construed in the distributive sense as including the Government
			<lb />
			and Parliament of India and the Government and the legislature of each
			<lb />
			State and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or
			<lb />
			under the control of the Government of India. When the concept of
			<lb />
			separation of the judiciary from the executive is assayed and assessed
			<lb />
			that concept cannot be confined only to the subordinate judiciary, totally
			<lb />
			discarding the higher judiciary. If such a narrow and pedantic or
			<lb />
			syllogistic approach is made and a constricted construction is given, it
			<lb />
			would lead to an anomalous position that the Constitution does not
			<lb />
			emphasise the separation of higher judiciary from the executive. Indeed,
			<lb />
			the distinguished Judges of this Court, as pointed out earlier, in various
			<lb />
			decisions have referred to Article 50 while discussing the concept of
			<lb />
			independence of higher or superior judiciary and thereby highlighted and
			<lb />
			laid stress on the basic principle and values underlying Article 50 in
			<lb />
			safeguarding the independence of the judiciary.

			<lb />
			judicial administration starting from the initial stage of selection of
			<lb />
			candidates to man the Supreme Court and the High Courts leading to the
			<lb />
			present malaise. Therefore, it has become inevitable that effective steps
			<lb />
			have to be taken to improve or retrieve the situation. After taking note of
			<lb />
			these problems and realising the devastating consequences that may
			<lb />
			flow, one cannot be a silent spectator or an old inveterate optimist,
			<lb />
			looking upon the other constitutional functionaries, particularly the
			<lb />
			executive, in the fond hope of getting invigorative solutions to make the
			<lb />
			justice delivery system more effective and resilient to meet the
			<lb />
			contemporary needs of the society, which hopes, as experience shows,
			<lb />
			have never been successful. Therefore, faced with such a piquant
			<lb />
			situation, it has become imperative for us to solve these problems within
			<lb />
			the constitutional fabric by interpreting the various provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution relating to the functioning of the judiciary in the light of the
			<lb />
			letter and spirit of the Constitution.

			141. Mr Ram Jethmalani, learned senior counsel expressed his grievance
			<lb />
			that the principles laid down in Chandra Mohan case (1967) 1 SCR 77,
			<lb />
			83… were not appreciated by the learned Judges while dealing with
			<lb />
			Samsher Singh v. State of Punjab, (1974) 2 SCC 831 who in his
			<lb />
			submission, have ignored the principle of harmonious construction
			<lb />
			which was articulated in K.M. Nanavati v. State of Bombay (1961) 1 SCR
			<lb />
			497… According to him, the judgment in Gupta case 1981 Supp SCC 87
			<lb />
			may be regarded as per incuriam. He articulates that the expression
			<lb />
			&apos;consultation&apos; is itself flexible and in a certain context capable of bearing
			<lb />
			the meaning of &apos;consent&apos; or &apos;concurrence&apos;.
			<lb />

			<lb />

			<lb />

			<lb />
			154. The controversy that arises for scrutiny from the arguments
			<lb />
			addressed boils down with regard to the construction of the word
			<lb />
			&apos;consultation&apos;.
			<lb />

			<lb />

			<lb />

			<lb />
			170. Thus, it is seen that the consensus of opinion is that consultation
			<lb />
			with the CJI is a mandatory condition precedent to the order of transfer
			<lb />
			made by the President so that non-consultation with the CJI shall render
			<lb />
			the order unconstitutional i.e. void.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			171. The above view of the mandatory character of the requirement of
			<lb />
			consultation taken in Sankalchand has been followed and reiterated by
			<lb />
			some of the Judges in Gupta case . Fazal Ali, J. has held in Gupta case :
			<lb />
			(SCC p. 483, para 569)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;(3) If the consultation with the CJI has not been done before transferring
			<lb />
			a Judge, the transfer becomes unconstitutional.&quot;
			<lb />
			Venkataramiah, J. in Gupta case has also expressed the same view.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			172. In the light of the above view expressed in Union of India v.
			<lb />
			Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth, (1977) SCC 4 193… and some of the
			<lb />
			Judges in Gupta case 1981 Supp SCC 87… it can be simply held that
			<lb />
			consultation with the CJI under the first proviso to Article 124(2) as well
			<lb />
			as under Article 217 is a mandatory condition, the violation of which
			<lb />
			would be contrary to the constitutional mandate.

			181. It cannot be gainsaid that the CJI being the head of the Indian
			<lb />
			Judiciary and paterfamilias of the judicial fraternity has to keep a vigilant
			<lb />
			watch in protecting the integrity and guarding the independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary and he in that capacity evaluates the merit of the candidate
			<lb />
			with regard to his/her professional attainments, legal ability etc. and
			<lb />
			offers his opinion. Therefore, there cannot be any justification in
			<lb />
			scanning that opinion of the CJI by applying a superimposition test
			<lb />
			under the guise of overguarding the judiciary.

			183. One should not lose sight of the important fact that appointment to
			<lb />
			the judicial office cannot be equated with the appointment to the
			<lb />
			executive or other services. In a recent judgment in All India Judges&apos;
			<lb />
			Association v. Union of India (1993) 4 SCC 288... rendered by a
			<lb />
			three-Judge Bench presided over by M.N. Venkatachaliah, C.J. and
			<lb />
			consisting of A.M. Ahmadi and P.B. Sawant, JJ., the following
			<lb />
			observations are made: (SCC pp. 295 e-h, 296 a and c-d, 297 b, paras 7
			<lb />
			and 9)
			<lb />
			&quot;The judicial service is not service in the sense of &apos;employment&apos;. The
			<lb />
			judges are not employees. As members of the judiciary, they exercise the
			<lb />
			sovereign judicial power of the State. They are holders of public offices in
			<lb />
			the same way as the members of the Council of Ministers and the
			<lb />
			members of the legislature. When it is said that in a democracy such as
			<lb />
			ours, the executive, the legislature and the judiciary constitute the three
			<lb />
			pillars of the State, what is intended to be conveyed is that the three
			<lb />
			essential functions of the State are entrusted to the three organs of the
			<lb />
			State and each one of them in turn represents the authority of the State.
			<lb />
			However, those who exercise the State power are the ministers, the
			<lb />
			legislators and the judges, and not the members of the their staff who
			<lb />
			implement or assist in implementing their decisions. The Council of
			<lb />
			Ministers or the political executive is different from the secretarial staff or
			<lb />
			the administrative executive which carries out the decisions of the
			<lb />
			political executive. Similarly, the legislators are different from the
			<lb />
			legislative staff. So also the judges from the judicial staff. The parity is
			<lb />
			between the political executive, the legislators and the judges and not
			<lb />
			between the judges and the administrative executive. In some
			<lb />
			democracies like the USA, members of some State judiciaries are elected
			<lb />
			as much as the members of the legislature and the heads of the State.
			<lb />
			The judges, at whatever level they may be, represent the State and its
			<lb />
			authority unlike the administrative executive or the members of other
			<lb />
			services. The members of the other services, therefore, cannot be placed
			<lb />
			on a par with the members of the judiciary, either constitutionally or
			<lb />
			functionally.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Whereupon, this Court recorded its conclusions. The relevant
			<lb />
			conclusions are extracted hereunder:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;(1) The &apos;consultation&apos; with the CJI by the President is relatable to the
			<lb />
			judiciary and not to any other service.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2) In the process of various constitutional appointments, &apos;consultation&apos; is
			<lb />
			required only to the judicial office in contrast to the other high-ranking
			<lb />
			constitutional offices. The prior &apos;consultation&apos; envisaged in the first
			<lb />
			proviso to Article 124(2) and Article 217(1) in respect of judicial offices is
			<lb />
			a reservation or limitation on the power of the President to appoint the
			<lb />
			Judges to the superior courts.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(4) The context in which the expression &quot;shall always be consulted&quot; used
			<lb />
			in the first proviso of Article 124(2) and the expression &quot;shall be
			<lb />
			appointed … after consultation&quot; deployed in Article 217(1) denote the
			<lb />
			mandatory character of &apos;consultation&apos;, which has to be and is of a binding
			<lb />
			character.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(5) Articles 124 and 217 do not speak in specific terms requiring the
			<lb />
			President to consult the executive as such, but the executive comes into
			<lb />
			play in the process of appointment of Judges to the higher echelons of
			<lb />
			judicial service by the operation of Articles 74 and 163 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. In other words, in the case of appointment of Judges, the
			<lb />
			President is not obliged to consult the executive as there is no specific
			<lb />
			provision for such consultation.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(6) The President is constitutionally obliged to consult the CJI alone in
			<lb />
			the case of appointment of a Judge to the Supreme Court as per the
			<lb />
			mandatory proviso to Article 124(2) and in the case of appointment of a
			<lb />
			Judge to the High Court, the President is obliged to consult the CJI and
			<lb />
			the Governor of the State and in addition the Chief Justice of the High
			<lb />
			Court concerned, in case the appointment relates to a Judge other than
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of that High Court. Therefore, to place the opinion of
			<lb />
			the CJI on a par with the other constitutional functionaries is not in
			<lb />
			consonance with the spirit of the Constitution, but against the very
			<lb />
			nature of the subject-matter concerning the judiciary and in opposition
			<lb />
			to the context in which &apos;consultation&apos; is required. After the observation of
			<lb />
			Bhagwati, J. in Gupta case that the &apos;consultation&apos; must be full and
			<lb />
			effective there is no conceivable reason to hold that such &apos;consultation&apos;
			<lb />
			need not be given primary consideration.

			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			196. In the background of the above factual and legal position, the
			<lb />
			meaning of the word &apos;consultation&apos; cannot be confined to its ordinary
			<lb />
			lexical definition. Its contents greatly vary according to the circumstances
			<lb />
			and context in which the word is used as in our Constitution.

			<lb />
			207. No one can deny that the State in the present day has become the
			<lb />
			major litigant and the superior courts particularly the Supreme Court,
			<lb />
			have become centres for turbulent controversies, some of which with a
			<lb />
			flavour of political repercussions and the Courts have to face tempest and
			<lb />
			storm because their vitality is a national imperative. In such
			<lb />
			circumstances, therefore, can the Government, namely, the major litigant
			<lb />
			be justified in enjoying absolute authority in nominating and appointing
			<lb />
			its arbitrators. The answer would be in the negative. If such a process is
			<lb />
			allowed to continue, the independence of judiciary in the long run will
			<lb />
			sink without any trace. By going through various Law Commission
			<lb />
			Reports (particularly Fourteenth, Eightieth and One Hundred and
			<lb />
			Twenty-first), Reports of the Seminars and articles of eminent jurists etc.,
			<lb />
			we understand that a radical change in the method of appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges to the superior judiciary by curbing the executive&apos;s power has
			<lb />
			been accentuated but the desired result has not been achieved even
			<lb />
			though by now nearly 46 years since the attainment of independence and
			<lb />
			more than 42 years since the advent of the formation of our
			<lb />
			constitutional system have elapsed. However, it is a proud privilege that
			<lb />
			the celebrated birth of our judicial system, its independence, mode of
			<lb />
			dispensation of justice by Judges of eminence holding nationalistic views
			<lb />
			stronger than other Judges in any other nations, and the resultant
			<lb />
			triumph of the Indian judiciary are highly commendable. But it does not
			<lb />
			mean that the present system should continue for ever, and by allowing
			<lb />
			the executive to enjoy the absolute primacy in the matter of appointment
			<lb />
			of Judges as its &apos;royal privilege&apos;.

			208. The polemics of the learned Attorney-General and Mr Parasaran for
			<lb />
			sustaining the view expressed in Gupta case 1981 Supp SCC 87…
			<lb />
			though so distinguished for the strength of their ratiocination, is found to
			<lb />
			be not acceptable and falls through for all the reasons aforementioned
			<lb />
			because of the inherent weakness of the doctrine which they have
			<lb />
			attempted to defend.&quot;

			Insofar as the minority judgment authored by A.M. Ahmadi, J., (as he
			<lb />

			<lb />
			recorded in paragraph 313, which is reproduced hereunder:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;313. We conclude:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(i) The concept of judicial independence is deeply ingrained in our
			<lb />
			constitutional scheme and Article 50 illuminates it. The degree of
			<lb />
			independence is near total after a person is appointed and inducted in
			<lb />
			the judicial family. …..&quot;

			<lb />
			counsel invited our attention to the preamble of the NJAC Act, which is

			2. The Supreme Court in the matter of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			Advocates-on-Record Association Vs. Union of India in the year 1993,
			<lb />
			and in its Advisory Opinion in the year 1998 in the Third Judges case,
			<lb />
			had interpreted clause (2) of article 124 and clause (1) of article 217 of
			<lb />
			the Constitution with respect to the meaning of &quot;consultation&quot; as
			<lb />
			&quot;concurrence&quot;. Consequently, a Memorandum of Procedure for
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts was
			<lb />
			formulated, and is being followed for appointment.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			3. After review of the relevant constitutional provisions, the
			<lb />
			pronouncements of the Supreme Court and consultations with eminent
			<lb />
			Jurists, it is felt that a broad based National Judicial Appointments
			<lb />
			Commission should be established for making recommendations for
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts. The said
			<lb />
			Commission would provide a meaningful role to the judiciary, the
			<lb />
			executive and eminent persons to present their view points and make the
			<lb />
			participants accountable, while also introducing transparency in the
			<lb />
			selection process.

			4. The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-first Amendment) Bill,
			<lb />
			2014 is an enabling constitutional amendment for amending relevant
			<lb />
			provisions of the Constitution and for setting up a National Judicial
			<lb />
			Appointments Commission. The proposed Bill seeks to insert new articles
			<lb />
			124A, 124B and 124C after article 124 of the Constitution. The said Bill
			<lb />
			also provides for the composition and the functions of the proposed
			<lb />
			National Judicial Appointments Commission. Further, it provides that
			<lb />
			Parliament may, by law, regulate the procedure for appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges and empower the National Judicial Appointments Commission to
			<lb />
			lay down procedure by regulation for the discharge of its functions,
			<lb />
			manner of selection of persons for appointment and such other matters
			<lb />
			as may be considered necessary.

		<p>
			5. The proposed Bill seeks to broad base the method of appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges in the Supreme Court and High Courts, enables participation of
			<lb />
			judiciary, executive and eminent persons and ensures greater
			<lb />
			transparency, accountability and objectivity in the appointment of the
			<lb />
			Judges in the Supreme Court and High Courts.

			<lb />
			The 8th August, 2014.&quot;
			<lb />
			Based on the non-disclosure of reasons, why the existing procedure was
			<lb />
			perceived as unsuitable, it was contended, that the only object sought to
			<lb />
			be achieved was, to dilute the primacy, earlier vested with the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India (based on a decision of a collegium of Judges), provided
			<lb />
			for under Articles 124 and 217, as originally enacted. This had been done
			<lb />
			away, it was pointed out, by substituting the Chief Justice of India, with
			<lb />
			the NJAC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			25. The primary submission advanced at the hands of Mr. Fali S.
			<lb />
			Nariman, Senior Advocate, was with reference to the violation of the
			<lb />
			&quot;basic structure&quot;, not only through the Constitution (99th Amendment)
			<lb />
			Act, but also, by enacting the NJAC Act. It was pointed out, that since
			<lb />
			the commencement of the Constitution, whenever changes were
			<lb />
			recommended in respect of the appointment of Judges, the issue which
			<lb />
			remained the focus of attention was, the primacy of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India. Primacy, it was contended, had been recognized as the decisive
			<lb />
			voice of the judiciary, based on a collective decision of a collegium of
			<lb />
			Judges, representing its collegiate wisdom. It was submitted, that the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India, as an individual, as well as, Chief Justices of High
			<lb />
			Courts, as individuals, could not be considered as persona designate. It
			<lb />
			was pointed out, that the judgment rendered in the Second Judges case,
			<lb />
			had not become irrelevant. This Court, in the above judgment, provided
			<lb />
			for the preservation of the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. The aforesaid
			<lb />
			judgment, as also, the later judgment in the Third Judges case,
			<lb />
			re-established and reaffirmed, that the Chief Justice of India, represented
			<lb />
			through a body of Judges, had primacy. According to learned counsel,
			<lb />
			the individual Chief Justice of India, could not and did not, represent the
			<lb />
			collective opinion of the Judges. It was asserted, that the Constitution
			<lb />
			(99th Amendment) Act, and the NJAC Act, had done away with, the
			<lb />
			responsibility vested with the Chief Justice of India, represented through
			<lb />
			a collegium of Judges (under Articles 124 and 217 -as originally
			<lb />
			enacted). Accordingly, it was submitted, that till the system adopted for
			<lb />
			selection and appointment of Judges, established and affirmed, the
			<lb />
			unimpeachable primacy of the judiciary, &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;
			<lb />
			could not be deemed to have been preserved.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			26. Insofar as the issue in hand is concerned, it was the pointed
			<lb />
			contention of the learned counsel, that the decision rendered by this
			<lb />
			Court in Sardari Lal v. Union of India 37 , came to be overruled in the
			<lb />
			Samsher Singh case 11 . Referring to the judgment in the Samsher Singh
			<lb />
			case 11 , he invited this Court&apos;s attention to the following observations
			<lb />
			recorded therein:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;147. In J.P. Mitter v. Chief Justice, Calcutta AIR 1965 SC 961 this Court
			<lb />
			had to consider the decision of the Government of India on the age of a
			<lb />
			Judge of the Calcutta High Court and, in that context, had to ascertain
			<lb />
			the true scope and effect of Article 217(3) which clothes the President
			<lb />
			with exclusive jurisdiction to determine the age of a Judge finally. In that
			<lb />
			case the Ministry of Home Affairs went through the exercise prescribed in
			<lb />
			Article 217(3). &quot;The then Home Minister wrote to the Chief Minister, West
			<lb />
			Bengal, that he had consulted the Chief Justice of India, and he agreed
			<lb />
			with the advice given to him by the Chief Justice, and so he had decided
			<lb />
			that the date of birth of the appellant was....It is this decision which was,
			<lb />
			in due course communicated to the appellant&quot;. When the said decision
			<lb />
			was attacked as one reached by the Home Minister only and not by the
			<lb />
			President personally, the Court observed:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The alternative stand which the appellant took was that the Executive
			<lb />
			was not entitled to determine his age, and it must be remembered that
			<lb />
			this stand was taken before Article 217(3) was inserted in the
			<lb />
			Constitution; the appellant was undoubtedly justified in contending that
			<lb />
			the Executive was not competent to determine the question about his age
			<lb />
			because that is a matter which would have to be tried normally, in
			<lb />
			judicial proceedings instituted before High Courts of competent
			<lb />
			jurisdiction. There is considerable force in the plea which the appellant
			<lb />
			took at the initial stages of this controversy that if the Executive is
			<lb />
			allowed to determine the age of a sitting Judge of a High Court, that
			<lb />
			would seriously affect the independence of the Judiciary itself.&quot;
			<lb />
			Based on this reasoning, the Court quashed the order, the ratio of the
			<lb />
			case being that the President himself should decide the age of the Judge,
			<lb />
			uninfluenced by the Executive, i.e. by the Minister in charge of the
			<lb />
			portfolio dealing with justice.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			148. This decision was reiterated in Union of India v. Jyoti Prakash
			<lb />
			Mitter (1971) 1 SCC 396. Although an argument was made that the
			<lb />
			President was guided in that case by the Minister of Home Affairs and by
			<lb />
			the Prime Minister, it was repelled by the Court which, on the facts,
			<lb />
			found the decision to be that of the President himself and not of the
			<lb />
			Prime Minister or the Home Minister.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			149. In the light of the scheme of the Constitution we have already
			<lb />
			referred to, it is doubtful whether such an interpretation as to the
			<lb />
			personal satisfaction of the President is correct. We are of the view that
			<lb />
			the President means, for all practical purposes, the Minister or the
			<lb />
			Council of Ministers as the case may be, and his opinion, satisfaction or
			<lb />
			decision is constitutionally secured when his Ministers arrive at such
			<lb />
			opinion satisfaction or decision. The independence of the Judiciary,
			<lb />
			which is a cardinal principle of the Constitution and has been relied on to
			<lb />
			justify the deviation, is guarded by the relevant article-making
			<lb />
			consultation with the Chief Justice of India obligatory. In all conceivable
			<lb />
			cases consultation with that highest dignitary of Indian justice will and
			<lb />
			should be accepted by the Government of India and the Court will have
			<lb />
			an opportunity to examine if any other extraneous circumstances have
			<lb />
			entered into the verdict of the Minister, if he departs from the counsel
			<lb />
			given by the Chief Justice of India. In practice the last word in such a
			<lb />
			sensitive subject must belong to the Chief Justice of India, the rejection
			<lb />
			of his advice being ordinarily regarded as prompted by oblique
			<lb />
			considerations vitiating the order. In this view it is immaterial whether
			<lb />
			the President or the Prime Minister or the Minister for Justice formally
			<lb />
			decides the issue.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			27. It was pointed out, that the decision in the Samsher Singh case 11 ,
			<lb />
			came to be rendered well before the decision in the First Judges case,
			<lb />
			wherein this Court felt, that Judges could be fearless only if, institutional
			<lb />
			immunity was assured, and institutional autonomy was guaranteed. The
			<lb />
			view expressed in the Samsher Singh case 11 in 1974 was, that the final
			<lb />
			authority in the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary,
			<lb />
			rested with the Chief Justice of India. It was pointed out, that the above
			<lb />
			position had held the field, ever since. It was submitted, that
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; has always meant and included
			<lb />
			independence in the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			28. Mr. Arvind P. Datar, learned Senior Advocate contended, that the
			<lb />
			NJAC had been created by an amendment to the Constitution. It
			<lb />
			therefore was a creature of the Constitution. Power had been vested with
			<lb />
			the NJAC to make recommendations of persons for appointment as
			<lb />
			Judges to the higher judiciary, including the power to transfer Chief
			<lb />
			Justices and Judges of High Courts, from one High Court to another.
			<lb />
			The above constitutional authority, it was submitted, must be regulated
			<lb />
			by a constitutional scheme, which must flow from the provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution itself. Therefore, it was asserted, that the manner of
			<lb />
			functioning of the NJAC must be contained in the Constitution itself. It
			<lb />
			was submitted, that the method of functioning of the NJAC, could not be
			<lb />
			left to the Parliament, to be regulated by ordinary law. In order to support
			<lb />
			his aforestated contention, reliance was placed on entries 77 and 78,
			<lb />
			contained in the Union List of the Seventh Schedule. It was submitted,
			<lb />
			that the power to frame legislation, with reference to entries 77 and 78
			<lb />
			was not absolute, inasmuch as, Article 245 authorized the Parliament, to
			<lb />
			legislate on subjects falling within its realm, subject to the substantive
			<lb />
			provisions contained in the Constitution. For the above reason, it was
			<lb />
			asserted, that the activities of the NJAC could not be made subject to, or
			<lb />
			subservient to, the power vested in the Parliament, under entries 77 and
			<lb />
			78.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			29. It was contended by Mr. Ram Jethmalani, learned Senior Advocate,
			<lb />
			that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to demonstrate, that the
			<lb />
			present political establishment felt, that the judiciary was an obstacle for
			<lb />
			the implementation of its policies. It was contended, that the entire
			<lb />
			effort, was to subdue the judiciary, by inducting into the selection
			<lb />
			process, those who could be politically influenced. In order to project,
			<lb />
			the concerted effort of the political dispensation, in subverting the
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, learned counsel, in the first instance,
			<lb />
			pointed out, that the first Bill to constitute a National Judicial
			<lb />
			Commission [the Constitution (67th Amendment) Bill, 1990] was
			<lb />
			introduced in the Lok Sabha on 18.5.1990. The statement of its &quot;Objects
			<lb />
			and Reasons&quot;, which was relied upon, is extracted below:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The Government of India have in the recent past announced their
			<lb />
			intention to set up a high level judicial commission, to be called the
			<lb />
			National Judicial Commission for the appointment of Judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court and of the High Courts and the transfer of Judges of the
			<lb />
			High Courts so as to obviate the criticisms of arbitrariness on the part of
			<lb />
			the Executive in such appointments and transfers and also to make such
			<lb />
			appointments without any delay. The Law Commission of India in their
			<lb />
			One Hundred and Twenty-first Report also emphasised the need for a
			<lb />
			change in the system.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			2. The National Judicial Commission to make recommendations with
			<lb />
			respect to the appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court will consist of
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India and two other Judges of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			next in seniority to the Chief Justice of India. The Commission to make
			<lb />
			recommendations with respect to the appointment of the Judges of the
			<lb />
			High Courts will consist of the Chief Justice of India, one senior-most
			<lb />
			Judge of the Supreme Court, the Chief Minister of the State concerned,
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of the concerned High Court and one senior-most Judge of
			<lb />
			that High Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3. The Bill seeks to achieve the above object.
			<lb />
			NEW DELHI;
			<lb />
			The 11 th May, 1990;&quot;
			<lb />
			The proposed National Judicial Commission in the above Bill, was to be
			<lb />
			made a component of Part XIIIA of the Constitution, by including therein
			<lb />
			Article 307A. The Chief Justice of India, and the next two senior most
			<lb />
			Judges of the Supreme Court, were proposed to comprise of the
			<lb />
			contemplated Commission, for making appointments of Judges to the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court, Chief Justices and Judges to High Courts, and for
			<lb />
			transfer of High Court Judges from one High Court to another. The above
			<lb />
			Commission, omitted any executive and legislative participation. The
			<lb />
			proposed composition of the Commission, for appointing High Court
			<lb />
			Judges, included the Chief Justice of India, the Chief Minister or the
			<lb />
			Governor of the concerned State, the senior most Judge of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court, the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court, and the senior
			<lb />
			most Judge of that Court. The above Bill also provided for, an
			<lb />
			independent and separate secretarial staff for the contemplated
			<lb />
			Commission. It was submitted, that the above amendment to the
			<lb />
			Constitution, was on account of the disillusionment and incredulity with
			<lb />
			the legal position, expounded by this Court in the First Judges case. It
			<lb />
			was submitted, that the necessity to give effect to the proposed
			<lb />
			Constitution (67th Amendment) Bill, 1990, stood obviated when this
			<lb />
			Court rendered its judgment in the Second Judges case. All this,
			<lb />
			according to learned counsel for the petitioners, has been forgotten and
			<lb />
			ignored.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			30. Historically, the next stage, was when the Constitution (98th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Bill, 2003 was placed before the Parliament for its
			<lb />
			consideration. In the above Bill, the executive participation in the process
			<lb />
			of selection and appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, was
			<lb />
			introduced by making the Union Minister of Law and Justice, an ex
			<lb />
			officio Member of the Commission. Two eminent citizens (either eminent
			<lb />
			jurists, or eminent lawyers, or legal academicians of high repute) would
			<lb />
			also be Members of the Commission. One of them was to be appointed by
			<lb />
			the President in consultation with the Chief Justice of India, and the
			<lb />
			other, in consultation with the Prime Minister. Yet another effort was
			<lb />
			made (by the previous U.P.A. Government), in the same direction,
			<lb />
			through the Constitution (120th Amendment) Bill, 2013, on similar lines
			<lb />
			as the 2003 Bill. It was sought to be pointed out, that there was a
			<lb />
			consensus amongst all the parties, that the aforesaid Bill should be
			<lb />
			approved. And that, learned counsel personally, as a Member of the
			<lb />
			Rajya Sabha, had strongly contested the above move. Learned counsel
			<lb />
			invited this Court&apos;s attention to the objections raised by him, during the
			<lb />
			course of the debate before the Rajya Sabha. He emphasized, that he had
			<lb />
			submitted to the Parliament, that the Constitution Amendment Bill,
			<lb />
			needed to be referred to the Select Committee of the Parliament, as the
			<lb />
			same in his opinion was unconstitutional. An extract of the debate was
			<lb />
			also brought to our notice (by substituting the vernacular part thereof,
			<lb />
			with its English translation), it is being reproduced hereunder:
			<lb />
			&quot;My suggestion is: Let the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill go to
			<lb />
			the Standing Committee. The rest of the business we should pass today.
			<lb />
			Thank you.
			<lb />
			Shri Ram Jethmalali: Madam, thank you; better late than never.
			<lb />
			Sir, I wish to make two preliminary suggestions. If there is an assurance
			<lb />
			that the Constitution (Amendment) Bill as well as the subsidiary Bill will
			<lb />
			both be referred to a Select Committee of Parliament, I do not propose to
			<lb />
			address this House at all. But, I do not consider it suitable or proper
			<lb />
			that only the second Bill should be referred to a Select Committee. Both
			<lb />
			should be sent. And, I will give my reasons.
			<lb />
			Sir, the second suggestion that I have to make is this. My main
			<lb />
			contention, which I am going to make, is that the Constitution
			<lb />
			(Amendment) Bill is wholly unconstitutional and, if passed, it will
			<lb />
			undoubtedly be set aside by the Supreme Court, because it interferes
			<lb />
			with the basic feature of the Constitution. Such amendments of the
			<lb />
			Constitution are outside the jurisdiction of this House. The amendment
			<lb />
			process prescribed by the Constitution requires 2/3 rd majority and so on
			<lb />
			and so forth. That applies only to those amendments of the Constitution
			<lb />
			which do not touch what are called the basic features of the Constitution
			<lb />
			as understood in the Kesavananda Bharati case. This Constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment, certainly, interferes with a basic feature of the Indian
			<lb />
			Constitution and it will not be sustained ever. But, if it is said that even
			<lb />
			if you pass it, it will not be brought into force until a Reference is made to
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court answers the question of the
			<lb />
			validity of this Constitution amendment in the affirmative. If that is
			<lb />
			done, I, again, need not speak. But, Sir, since I don&apos;t expect both these
			<lb />
			reasonable suggestions to be accepted, I intend to speak and speak my
			<lb />
			mind.
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Kapil is my great friend and is one of the Ministers in the Government
			<lb />
			whose work as the Law Minister I keep supervising and I am happy the
			<lb />
			manner in which he conducts his Ministry. But, Sir, I must declare
			<lb />
			today that my conscience, understanding and my duty towards the
			<lb />
			people of this country, which I regard as my paramount obligation, do
			<lb />
			not permit me to submit to this kind of legislation.
			<lb />
			Both the Bills,
			<lb />
			according to me are evil. The evil, first of all, consists in the misleading
			<lb />
			Statement of Objects-and-Reasons.
			<lb />
			You ought to have said with
			<lb />
			complete honesty that what you are trying to demolish is the Collegium
			<lb />
			System, which seems to be the object, and which is apparent to anyone.
			<lb />
			Some of the persons who have spoken have spoken on the assumption
			<lb />
			that that is the purpose of this particular piece of legislation.
			<lb />
			Sir, the first point that I propose to make is that the 1993 judgment of
			<lb />
			Nine Judges is a judgment based upon the discovery of the basic feature
			<lb />
			of the Constitution, and upon devising a system to sustain that basic
			<lb />
			feature. Madam, I have myself appeared in that litigation and I claim that
			<lb />
			I had a tremendous contribution to make to the success of that
			<lb />
			judgment. In a sense, I claim to be the founder of the Collegium System.
			<lb />
			But that does not mean that I am an unmixed admirer of the Collegium
			<lb />
			System. The Collegium System has, doubtless, some faults. But the
			<lb />
			Collegium System came into existence on the basis of one main
			<lb />
			argument. That one main argument that we advance, and advance with
			<lb />
			great vigour and force, is that there is one article of the Constitution,
			<lb />
			article 50 of the Constitution, which is the shortest article in the
			<lb />
			Constitution, consisting of only one sentence. That article says that the
			<lb />
			Government shall strive to keep the Judiciary separate from the
			<lb />
			Executive.
			<lb />
			Sir, we argued before the Supreme Court that this article does not mean
			<lb />
			that Judges and Ministers should not socially meet. This does not mean
			<lb />
			that they should live in separate towns, or that they should not live even
			<lb />
			in adjoining bungalows. The purpose of this article is to ensure that in
			<lb />
			the appointment of Judges, the Executive has no role to play, except the
			<lb />
			advisory role. In other words, the doctrine of primacy of the Executive in
			<lb />
			the appointment process was irksome to us because the whole nation of
			<lb />
			India has been the victim of the Judges appointed in the earlier system. I
			<lb />
			have been a refugee from my own country during the Emergency. Why
			<lb />
			was it? It was because four Supreme Court Judges -I am not talking of
			<lb />
			the fifth who earned the New York Times praise that the Indian nation
			<lb />
			will have to build a monument to his memory; I am talking of the other
			<lb />
			four who -disgraced the Judiciary, disgraced the Supreme Court and
			<lb />
			were parties to the destruction of Indian democracy and the demolition
			<lb />
			and the debasement of the whole Constitution of India. Sir, of which
			<lb />
			system were they the product? They were the product of that system
			<lb />
			which, in 1981, was ultimately supported by the Gupta Judgment but,
			<lb />
			after some time, there were people, intellectuals, who spoke up that this
			<lb />
			system would not work; the system requires change. Sir, the Indian
			<lb />
			democracy has been saved not by intellectuals; Indian democracy at its
			<lb />
			most crucial hour has been saved by the poor illiterates of this country.
			<lb />
			In times of crises, it is only the brave hearted who matter. On those
			<lb />
			which one had pride remained tongue tied (Two sentences translated).
			<lb />
			That is the tragedy of our country. Sir, the intellectuals of this country
			<lb />
			have continuously failed, and I regret to say that they are failing even
			<lb />
			today. Collegium may be the creation of the Judiciary, it is the creation of
			<lb />
			judicial interpretation, again, of the Constitution, but whatever be the
			<lb />
			faults of the Collegium, the Collegium today represents some system
			<lb />
			which is consistent with the basic features of the Constitution, namely,
			<lb />
			the supremacy of the Judiciary and its freedom from any influence of the
			<lb />
			Executive in the appointment process.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			Sir, I am speaking for those who are not irrevocably committed to voting
			<lb />
			for this amendment. There are some people who must have kept their
			<lb />
			minds still open. I am appealing to those minds today only. Those who
			<lb />
			are irrevocably committed are committed to the destruction of Indian
			<lb />
			democracy.
			<lb />
			Sir, the key passage in the judgment of the Supreme Court of 1993 is the
			<lb />
			passage which I wish to share with the House. The question of primacy to
			<lb />
			the opinion of the Chief Justice of India in the matters of appointment
			<lb />
			and transfer and their justifiability should be considered in the context of
			<lb />
			the independence of the Judiciary as a part of the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution to secure the rule of law essential for preservation of the
			<lb />
			democratic system. The broad scheme of separation of powers adopted in
			<lb />
			the Constitution together with the Directive Principles of separation of
			<lb />
			the Judiciary from the Executive, even at the lowest strata, provides
			<lb />
			some insight to the true meaning of the relevant provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution relating to the composition of the Judiciary. The
			<lb />
			construction of these provisions must accord with these fundamental
			<lb />
			concepts in the Constitutional scheme to preserve the vitality and
			<lb />
			promote the growth of the essential of retaining the Constitution as a
			<lb />
			vibrant organism&quot;.
			<lb />
			Sir, the Constitution cannot survive, human freedom cannot survive,
			<lb />
			citizens&apos; human rights cannot survive, no development can take place
			<lb />
			unless, of course, the judges are independent first of the Executive power
			<lb />
			because don&apos;t forget that every citizen has a grievance against the corrupt
			<lb />
			members of the Executive, or, errant bureaucracy, public officers
			<lb />
			misusing power, indulging in corruption, making wrong and illegal
			<lb />
			orders. The citizen goes to the court, knocks the door of the court and
			<lb />
			says, &quot;Please give me a mandamus against this corrupt official, against
			<lb />
			this corrupt Minister&quot;. And, Sir, the judges are supposed to decide upon
			<lb />
			the claims of the poorest who go to the Supreme Court... ...
			<lb />
			(Interruptions)... ...and to the judges. It may be, and I am conscious... ...
			<lb />
			(Interruptions)... Sir, this is not a laughing matter. Please listen, and then
			<lb />
			decide for yourself. ...
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			Sir, first of all, let me say this now that the whole judgement of nine
			<lb />
			Judges is based upon this principle that in the appointment process, the
			<lb />
			Executive can never have primacy. This is principle number one. It has
			<lb />
			now become the basic feature of India&apos;s Constitution. My grievance today
			<lb />
			against this Constitution (Amendment) Bill is that you are slowly, slowly
			<lb />
			now creating a new method by which ultimately you will revert to the
			<lb />
			system which existed prior to 1993. In other words, the same system
			<lb />
			would produce those four Judges who destroyed the Indian democracy,
			<lb />
			human rights and freedom. Sir, kindly see, why. The Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment looks very
		</p>
		<item>
			innocent. All that it says is that we shall have a
			<lb />
			new article 124(a) in the Constitution and article 124(a) merely says that
			<lb />
			there shall be a Judicial Appointments Commission. It lays down that the
			<lb />
			Judicial Appointments Commission will have these functions. It leaves at
			<lb />
			that. But, kindly see that after the first sentence, every thing is left to a
			<lb />
			Parliamentary will. After saying that there will be a Judicial
			<lb />
			Appointments Commission, every thing will be left, according to the
			<lb />
			second part of 124(a), to a parliamentary legislation which is capable of
			<lb />
			being removed if the ruling party has one Member majority in both
			<lb />
			Houses of Parliament. Not only that, I understand that Parliament is not
			<lb />
			likely to do it, but it can do it and by a majority of one in both Houses,
			<lb />
			you can demolish the whole thing and substitute it with a Judicial
			<lb />
			Commission which will consist of only the Law Minister.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			So, Sir, my first objection is that this Bill is a Bill which is intended to
			<lb />
			deal with the basic structure of the Constitution and, therefore, this Bill
			<lb />
			is void. (Time-bell) Second, if a Constitutional Amendment is not good
			<lb />
			enough for this purpose, surely, an ordinary piece of legislation cannot
			<lb />
			do it, which ordinary piece of legislation can be removed only by a
			<lb />
			majority of one in each House. It can be removed like the 30th July Food
			<lb />
			Security Ordinance and you can pass an Ordinance on that day and say
			<lb />
			that the whole Act is repealed and now the system will be that Judges
			<lb />
			will be appointed for the next six months by only the Law Minister of
			<lb />
			India. If there was Mr. Kapil Sibal, ...(Interruptions)... If Mr. Kapil Sibal
			<lb />
			becomes the Law Minister for ever, Sir, I will allow this Bill to go.
			<lb />
			(Time-bell) But I am not prepared to accept it for the future Law
			<lb />
			Ministers. ...(Interruptions)... Sir, let me take two more minutes and tell
			<lb />
			all those Members that this Bill is not intended to ensure the judicial
			<lb />
			character. This Bill has nothing to do with the improvement of the
			<lb />
			judicial character. So long as the Judges are also human, there will be
			<lb />
			some Judges who will go wrong, who may go wrong. But a great Bar can
			<lb />
			control them. ….&quot;
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			Sir, I hope, people will avoid this kind of a tragedy in the life of this
			<lb />
			country. You are today digging the grave of the Constitution of India and
			<lb />
			the freedom of this country. ...(Interruptions)... That&apos;s all I wished to
			<lb />
			say. ...(Interruptions)...&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			It was submitted, that in the Rajya Sabha 131 votes were cast in
			<lb />
			affirmation of the proposed Bill, as against the solitary vote of the learned
			<lb />
			counsel, against the same on 5.9.2013. It was however pointed out, that
			<lb />
			the effort did not bear fruit, on account of the intervening declaration for
			<lb />
			elections to the Parliament.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			31. Learned counsel thereafter, invited our attention to the statement of
			<lb />
			&quot;Objects and Reasons&quot; for the promulgation of the Constitution (121st
			<lb />
			Amendment) Bill, 2014. The Bill which eventually gave rise to the
			<lb />
			impugned Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, was taken up for
			<lb />
			consideration by the Lok Sabha on 13.8.2014, and was passed without
			<lb />
			much debate. It was submitted, that on the following day i.e., 14.8.2014,
			<lb />
			the same was placed before the Rajya Sabha, and was again passed,
			<lb />
			without much discussion. It was pointed out, that an issue, as serious
			<lb />
			as the one in hand, which could have serious repercussions on the
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, was sought to be rushed through.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			32. It was submitted, that the &quot;Objects and Reasons&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution (99th Amendment) Act were painfully lacking, in the
			<lb />
			expression of details, which had necessitated the proposed/impugned
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment. It was submitted, that it was imperative to
			<lb />
			have brought to the notice of the Parliament, that the Supreme Court had
			<lb />
			declared, that the &quot;rule of law&quot;, the &quot;separation of powers&quot; and the
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, were &quot;salient and basic features&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. And that, the same could not be abrogated, through a
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment. And further that, the Supreme Court had
			<lb />
			expressly provided for the primacy of the Chief Justice of India, based on
			<lb />
			a decision of a collegium of Judges, with reference to the appointments
			<lb />
			and transfers of Judges of the higher judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			33. It was submitted by Mr. Ram Jethmalani, that the impugned
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment, so as to introduce Article 124A, ought to be
			<lb />
			described as a fraud on the Constitution itself. It was pointed out, that
			<lb />
			the first effort of introducing Article 124A was made by the previous
			<lb />
			Government, through the Constitution (120th Amendment) Bill, 2013. In
			<lb />
			the above Bill, Article 124A alone (as against Articles 124A to 124C,
			<lb />
			presently enacted) was introduced. It was submitted, that the Rajya
			<lb />
			Sabha passed the above Bill on 5.9.2013, when 131 Members of the
			<lb />
			Rajya Sabha supported the Bill (with only one Member opposing it).
			<lb />
			Learned counsel submitted, that he alone had opposed the Bill. It was
			<lb />
			asserted, that the above fraud was sought to be perpetuated, through the
			<lb />
			passing of the Constitution (121st Amendment) Bill, 2014, by the Lok
			<lb />
			Sabha on 13.8.2014, and by the Rajya Sabha on 14.8.2014. It was
			<lb />
			pointed out, that Parliamentarians from different political parties had
			<lb />
			joined hands. It was submitted, that as a Parliamentarian, he was in a
			<lb />
			position to assert, that the merits and demerits of the impugned
			<lb />
			amendment to the Constitution, were not debated, when the Bill was
			<lb />
			passed, because of the universal bias entertained by the legislature,
			<lb />
			against the judiciary. It was submitted, that prejudice and intolerance
			<lb />
			had arisen, because of the fact that the judiciary often interfered with,
			<lb />
			and often effaced legislative action(s), as also, executive decision(s).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			34. Learned senior counsel also asserted, that the Constitution (99th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, was wholly ultra vires, as it seriously infringed the
			<lb />
			&quot;basic structure/feature&quot; of the Constitution i.e., the &quot;independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary&quot;. It was submitted, that the veracity of the above
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment, had to be examined in the light of Article 50.
			<lb />
			According to learned counsel, the politicization of the process of selection
			<lb />
			and appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, would lead to a
			<lb />
			dilution of the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. It was submitted, that the
			<lb />
			inclusion of the Union Minister in charge of Law and Justice, as an ex
			<lb />
			officio Member of the NJAC, had the effect of politicization of the process
			<lb />
			of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary. It was pointed out, that
			<lb />
			the inclusion of the Union Minister in charge of Law and Justice within
			<lb />
			the framework of the NJAC, meant the introduction of the Government of
			<lb />
			the day, into the selection process. It was asserted, that the Union
			<lb />
			Minister&apos;s inclusion, meant surrendering one-sixth of the power of
			<lb />
			appointment, to the Government. It was submitted, that in order to
			<lb />
			understand the true effect of the inclusion of the Union Minister, into the
			<lb />
			process of selection and appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary,
			<lb />
			one had to keep in mind the tremendous amount of patronage, which the
			<lb />
			Union Minister for Law and Justice carries, and as such, it would be
			<lb />
			within the inference of the Union Minister in charge of Law and Justice,
			<lb />
			to make the process fallible, by extending his power of patronage to
			<lb />
			support or oppose candidates, who may be suitable or unsuitable, to the
			<lb />
			Government of the day. Even though the Union Minister had been
			<lb />
			assigned only one vote, it was submitted, that he could paralyse the
			<lb />
			whole system, on the basis of the authority he exercised. To drive home
			<lb />
			his contention, learned counsel made a reference to the introduction of
			<lb />
			the book &quot;Choosing Hammurabi -Debates on Judicial Appointments&quot;,
			<lb />
			edited by Santosh Paul. In the introduction to the book, the thoughts of
			<lb />
			H.L. Mencken are expressed in the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;But when politicians talk thus, or act thus without talking, it is precisely
			<lb />
			the time to watch them most carefully. Their usual plan is to invade the
			<lb />
			constitution stealthily, and then wait to see what happens. If nothing
			<lb />
			happens they go on more boldly; if there is a protest they reply hotly that
			<lb />
			the constitution is worn out and absurd, and that progress is impossible
			<lb />
			under the dead hand. This is the time to watch them especially. They
			<lb />
			are up to no good to anyone save themselves. They are trying to whittle
			<lb />
			away the common rights of the rest of us. Their one and only object, now
			<lb />
			and always, is to get more power in to their hands that it may be used
			<lb />
			freely for their advantage, and to the damage of everyone else. Beware of
			<lb />
			all politicians at all times, but beware of them most sharply when they
			<lb />
			talk of reforming and improving the constitution.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			35. Learned Senior Advocate also contended, that the inclusion of two
			<lb />
			&quot;eminent persons&quot; in the six-Member NJAC, as provided for, under
			<lb />
			Article 124A(1) of the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, was also
			<lb />
			clearly unconstitutional. It was contended, that there necessarily had to
			<lb />
			be, an indication of the positive qualifications required to be possessed by
			<lb />
			the two &quot;eminent persons&quot;, to be nominated to the NJAC. Additionally, it
			<lb />
			was necessary to stipulate disqualifications. Illustratively, it was pointed
			<lb />
			out, that an individual having a conflict of interest, should be
			<lb />
			disqualified. And such conflict would be apparent, when the individual
			<lb />
			had a political role. A politician has to serve his constituency, he has to
			<lb />
			nourish and sustain his vote bank, and above all, he has to conform with
			<lb />
			the agenda of his political party. Likewise, a person with ongoing
			<lb />
			litigation, irrespective of the nature of such litigation, would render
			<lb />
			himself ineligible for serving as an &quot;eminent person&quot; within the
			<lb />
			framework of the NJAC, because of his conflict of interest.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			36. With reference to the inclusion of two &quot;eminent persons&quot; in the
			<lb />
			NJAC, Mr. Arvind P. Datar, learned Senior Advocate, invited our attention
			<lb />
			to Article 124A, whereunder, the above two &quot;eminent persons&quot; are to be
			<lb />
			nominated by a committee comprising of the Prime Minister, the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India and the Leader of Opposition in the House of People, or,
			<lb />
			where there is no such Leader of Opposition, then, leader of the single
			<lb />
			largest opposition party in the House of the People. Learned counsel
			<lb />
			submitted, that neither Article 124A, nor any other provision, and not
			<lb />
			even the provisions of the NJAC Act, indicate the qualifications, of the
			<lb />
			two &quot;eminent persons&quot;, who have been included amongst the six-Member
			<lb />
			NJAC. It was sought to be asserted, that in approximately 70 Statutes
			<lb />
			and Rules, the expression &quot;eminent person&quot; has been employed. Out of
			<lb />
			the 70 Statutes, in 67, the field in which such persons must be eminent,
			<lb />
			has been clearly expressed. Only in three statutes, the term &quot;eminent
			<lb />
			person&quot; was used without any further qualification. It was asserted, that
			<lb />
			the term &quot;eminent person&quot; had been left vague and undefined, in Article
			<lb />
			124A. It was submitted, that the vagueness of the term &quot;eminent person&quot;
			<lb />
			was itself, good enough to justify the striking down of the provision. It
			<lb />
			was emphasized, that the determinative role assigned to the two &quot;eminent
			<lb />
			persons&quot;, included amongst the six-Member NJAC, was so important,
			<lb />
			that the same could not be left to the imagination of the nominating
			<lb />
			committee, which comprised of just men &quot;…with all the failings, all the
			<lb />
			sentiments and all prejudices which we as common people have…&quot;
			<lb />
			(relying on the words of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			37. Referring to the second proviso under Section 5(2), as well as,
			<lb />
			Section 6(6) of the NJAC Act, it was submitted, that a recommendation
			<lb />
			for appointment of a Judge, could not be carried out, if the two &quot;eminent
			<lb />
			persons&quot; did not accede to the same. In case they choose to disagree with
			<lb />
			the other Members of the NJAC, the proposed recommendation could not
			<lb />
			be given effect to, even though the other four Members of the NJAC
			<lb />
			including all the three representatives of the Supreme Court approved of
			<lb />
			the same. It was pointed out, that the two &quot;eminent persons&quot;, therefore
			<lb />
			would have a decisive say. It was further submitted, that the impact of
			<lb />
			the determination of the two &quot;eminent persons&quot;, would be such, as would
			<lb />
			negate the primacy hitherto before vested in the Chief Justice of India. It
			<lb />
			was pointed out, that a positive recommendation by the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, supported by two other senior Judges of the Supreme Court (next
			<lb />
			to the Chief Justice of India), could be frustrated by an opposition at the
			<lb />
			hands of the two &quot;eminent persons&quot;. The above implied veto power,
			<lb />
			according to the learned counsel, could lead to structured bargaining, so
			<lb />
			as to persuade the other Members of the NJAC, to accede to the names of
			<lb />
			undesirable nominees (just to avoid a stalemate of sorts). It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that such a composition had been adversely commented upon
			<lb />
			by this Court in Union of India v. R. Gandhi 38 . In the judgment, the
			<lb />
			provision, which was subject matter of consideration, was Section 10-FX.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Under the above provision, the Selection Committee for appointing the
			<lb />
			Chairperson and Members of the Appellate Tribunal, and the President
			<lb />
			and Members of the Tribunal was to be comprised of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India (or his nominee), besides four Secretaries from different Ministries
			<lb />
			of the Union Government. This Court recorded its conclusions with
			<lb />
			reference to the aforesaid provision in paragraph 120(viii), which is being
			<lb />
			extracted hereunder:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			120(viii) Instead of a five-member Selection Committee with the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India (or his nominee) as Chairperson and two Secretaries from
			<lb />
			the Ministry of Finance and Company Affairs and the Secretary in the
			<lb />
			Ministry of Labour and the Secretary in the Ministry of Law and Justice
			<lb />
			as members mentioned in Section 10-FX, the Selection Committee should
			<lb />
			broadly be on the following lines:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(a) Chief Justice of India or his nominee -Chairperson (with a casting
			<lb />
			vote);
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(b) A Senior Judge of the Supreme Court or Chief Justice of High Court -
			<lb />
			Member;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(c) Secretary in the Ministry of Finance and Company Affairs -Member;
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(d) Secretary in the Ministry of Law and Justice -Member.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			It was submitted, that the purpose sought to be achieved, was not
			<lb />
			exclusivity, but primacy. It is further submitted, that if primacy was
			<lb />
			considered to be important for selection of Members to be appointed to a
			<lb />
			tribunal, primacy assumed a far greater significance, when the issue
			<lb />
			under consideration was appointment and transfer of Judges of the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary. It was accordingly contended, that the manner in which
			<lb />
			the composition of the NJAC had been worked out in Article 124A, and
			<lb />
			the manner in which the NJAC is to function with reference to the
			<lb />
			provisions of the NJAC Act, left no room for any doubt, that the same was
			<lb />
			in clear violation of the law laid down by this Court, and therefore, liable
			<lb />
			to be set aside.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			38. Learned counsel on the above facts, contested not only the
			<lb />
			constitutional validity of clauses (c) and (d) of Article 124A(1), but also
			<lb />
			emphatically assailed the first proviso under Article 124A(1)(d), which
			<lb />
			postulates, that one of the &quot;eminent persons&quot; should belong to the
			<lb />
			Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, Minorities
			<lb />
			or Women. It was submitted, that these sort of populistic measures,
			<lb />
			ought not to be thought of, while examining a matter as important as the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary. It was submitted, that it was not understandable, what
			<lb />
			the choice of including a person from one of the aforesaid categories was
			<lb />
			aimed at. In the opinion of learned counsel, the above proviso was
			<lb />
			farcical, and therefore, totally unacceptable. While members of a
			<lb />
			particular community may be relevant for protecting the interest of their
			<lb />
			community, yet it could not be conceived, why such a measure should be
			<lb />
			adopted, for such an important constitutional responsibility. In the
			<lb />
			opinion of the learned counsel, the inclusion of such a Member in the
			<lb />
			NJAC, was bound to lead to compromises.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			39. It was also the contention of Mr. Arvind P. Datar, that Article 124C
			<lb />
			introduced by the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, was wholly
			<lb />
			unnecessary. It was pointed out, that in the absence of Article 124C, the
			<lb />
			NJAC would have had the inherent power to regulate its own functioning.
			<lb />
			It was submitted, that Article 124C was a serious intrusion into the
			<lb />
			above inherent power. Now that, the Parliament had been authorized to
			<lb />
			regulate the procedure for appointments by framing laws, it would also
			<lb />
			result in the transfer of control over the appointment process (-of Judges
			<lb />
			to the higher judiciary), to the Parliament. It was submitted, that there
			<lb />
			could not be any legislative control, with reference to appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges to the higher judiciary. Such legislative control, according to
			<lb />
			learned counsel, would breach &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the Parliament having exercised its authority in that
			<lb />
			behalf, by framing the NJAC Act, and having provided therein, the
			<lb />
			ultimate control with the Parliament, must be deemed to have crossed
			<lb />
			the line, and transgressed into forbidden territory, exclusively reserved
			<lb />
			for the judiciary. Learned counsel contended, that the duties and
			<lb />
			responsibilities vested in a constitutional authority, could only be
			<lb />
			circumscribed by the Constitution, and not by the Parliament through
			<lb />
			legislation. It was submitted, that the NJAC was a creature of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, as the NJAC flows out of Article 124A. Likewise, the
			<lb />
			Parliament, was also a creature of the Constitution. It was submitted,
			<lb />
			that one entity which was the creation of the Constitution, could not
			<lb />
			regulate the other, owing its existence to the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			40. It was pointed out by Mr. Ram Jethmalani, learned Senior
			<lb />
			Advocate, that the statement of &quot;Objects and Reasons&quot;, as were projected
			<lb />
			for the instant legislation, indicated inter alia, that the NJAC would
			<lb />
			provide &quot;a meaningful role to the judiciary&quot;. It was submitted, that what
			<lb />
			was meant by the aforesaid affirmation, was not comprehendible to him.
			<lb />
			It was further highlighted, that it also asserted in the &quot;Objects and
			<lb />
			Reasons&quot;, that &quot;the executive and the eminent persons to present their
			<lb />
			viewpoints and make the participants accountable&quot;, was likewise
			<lb />
			unintelligible to him. It was submitted, that a perusal of the Constitution
			<lb />
			(99th Amendment) Act (as also, the NJAC Act) would not reveal, how the
			<lb />
			Members of the NJAC were to be made responsible. It was further
			<lb />
			submitted, that the statement of &quot;Objects and Reasons&quot; also indicate,
			<lb />
			that the manner of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, would
			<lb />
			introduce transparency in the selection process. It was contended, that
			<lb />
			the enactments under reference, amounted to commission of a fraud by
			<lb />
			Parliament, on the people of the country. As it was not possible to
			<lb />
			understand, how and who was to be made accountable -the executive, -
			<lb />
			the &quot;eminent persons&quot;, -the judiciary itself. It was accordingly sought to
			<lb />
			be asserted, that the Parliament seemed to be asserting one thing, while
			<lb />
			it was doing something else. Learned counsel also placed reliance on
			<lb />
			Shreya Singhal v. Union of India 39 , wherefrom the following observations
			<lb />
			were brought to our notice:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;50. Counsel for the Petitioners argued that the language used in Section
			<lb />
			66A is so vague that neither would an accused person be put on notice
			<lb />
			as to what exactly is the offence which has been committed nor would the
			<lb />
			authorities administering the Section be clear as to on which side of a
			<lb />
			clearly drawn line a particular communication will fall.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Based on the above submissions, it was asserted, that the statement of
			<lb />
			&quot;Objects and Reasons&quot;, could not have been more vague, ambiguous, and
			<lb />
			fanciful than the ones in the matter at hand.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			41. Mr. Anil B. Divan, Senior Advocate, while appearing for the
			<lb />
			petitioner in the petition filed by the Bar Association of India (Writ
			<lb />
			Petition (C) No.108 of 2015), first and foremost pointed out, that the Bar
			<lb />
			Association of India represents the High Court Bar Association, Kolkata
			<lb />
			(West Bengal), The Awadh Bar Association, Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh), the
			<lb />
			Madras Bar Association, Chennai (Tamil Nadu), the Supreme Court Bar
			<lb />
			Association, New Delhi, the Gujarat High Court Advocates&apos; Association,
			<lb />
			Gandhinagar (Gujarat), the Advocates&apos; Association, Chennai (Tamil
			<lb />
			Nadu), the Andhra Pradesh High Court Advocates&apos; Association,
			<lb />
			Hyderabad (Andhra Pradesh), the Delhi High Court Bar Association, New
			<lb />
			Delhi, the Bar Association Mumbai (Maharashtra), the Gauhati High
			<lb />
			Court Bar Association, Guwahati (Assam), the Punjab &amp; Haryana High
			<lb />
			Court Bar Association, Chandigarh (Punjab &amp; Haryana), the Bombay
			<lb />
			Incorporated Law Society, Mumbai (Maharashtra), the Madhya Pradesh
			<lb />
			High Court Bar Association, Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh), the Advocates&apos;
			<lb />
			Association Bangalore (Karnataka), the Central Excise, Customs (Gold)
			<lb />
			Control Bar Association, New Delhi, the Advocates&apos; Association,
			<lb />
			Allahabad (Uttar Pradesh), the Karnataka Advocates&apos; Federation,
			<lb />
			Bangalore (Karnataka), the Allahabad High Court Bar Association (Uttar
			<lb />
			Pradesh), the Goa High Court Bar Association, Panaji (Goa), the Society
			<lb />
			of India Law of Firms, New Delhi, the Chhattisgarh High Court Bar
			<lb />
			Association, Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh), the Nagpur High Court Bar
			<lb />
			Association, Nagpur (Maharashtra), the Madurai Bench of Madras High
			<lb />
			Court Bar Association, Madurai (Tamil Nadu), the Jharkhand High Court
			<lb />
			Bar Association, Ranchi (Jharkhand), the Bar Association of National
			<lb />
			Capital Region, New Delhi, and the Gulbarga High Court Bar Association,
			<lb />
			Gulbarga (Karnataka). It was submitted, that all the aforementioned Bar
			<lb />
			Associations were unanimous in their challenge, to the Constitution
			<lb />
			(99th Amendment) Act, and the NJAC Act. It was submitted, that the
			<lb />
			challenge to the former was based on the fact that it violated the &quot;basic
			<lb />
			structure&quot; of the Constitution, and the challenge to the latter, was based
			<lb />
			on its being ultra vires the provisions of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			42. Learned counsel had adopted a stance, which was different from
			<lb />
			the one adopted by others. The submissions advanced by the learned
			<lb />
			senior counsel, were premised on the fact, that under the constitutional
			<lb />
			power of judicial review, the higher judiciary not only enforced
			<lb />
			fundamental rights, but also restricted the legislature and the executive,
			<lb />
			within the confines of their jurisdiction(s). It was pointed out, that it was
			<lb />
			the above power, which was the source of tension and friction between
			<lb />
			the judiciary on the one hand, and the two other pillars of governance
			<lb />
			i.e., the legislature and the executive, on the other. This friction, it was
			<lb />
			pointed out, was caused on account of the fact, that while discharging its
			<lb />
			responsibility of judicial review, executive backed actions of the
			<lb />
			legislature, were sometimes invalidated, resulting in the belief, that the
			<lb />
			judiciary was influencing and dominating the other two pillars of
			<lb />
			governance. Illustratively, it was pointed out, that in the beginning of
			<lb />
			independent governance of the country, judicial review led to the setting
			<lb />
			aside of legislations, pertaining to land reforms and zamindari abolition.
			<lb />
			This had led to the adoption of inserting legislations in the Ninth
			<lb />
			Schedule of the Constitution, so as to exclude them from the purview of
			<lb />
			judicial review.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			43. It was submitted, that the first manifestation of a confrontation
			<lb />
			between the judiciary and the other two wings of governance, were
			<lb />
			indicated in the observations recorded in State of Madras v. V.G. Row 40 ,
			<lb />
			wherein, as far back as in 1952, the Supreme Court observed, that its
			<lb />
			conclusions were recorded, not out of any desire to a tilt at the legislative
			<lb />
			authority in a crusader&apos;s spirit, but in discharge of the duty plainly laid
			<lb />
			upon the Courts, by the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			44. It was submitted, that the legislations placed in the Ninth Schedule
			<lb />
			of the Constitution, from the original 13 items (relating to land reforms
			<lb />
			and zamindari abolition), multiplied at a brisk rate, and currently
			<lb />
			numbered about 284. And many of them, had hardly anything to do with
			<lb />
			land reforms. It was contended, that the decision rendered by this Court
			<lb />
			in I.C. Golak Nath v. State of Punjab 41 , was a judicial reaction to the
			<lb />
			uninhibited insertions in the Ninth Schedule, leading to completely
			<lb />
			eclipsing fundamental rights. It therefore came to be held in the I.C.
			<lb />
			Golak Nath case 41 , that Parliament by way of constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment(s) could not take away or abridge fundamental rights.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			45. To project his contention, pertaining to tension and friction between
			<lb />
			the judiciary and the other two wings of governance, it was submitted,
			<lb />
			that from 1950 to 1973, there was virtually no attempt by the
			<lb />
			political-executive, to undermine or influence or dominate over the
			<lb />
			judiciary. It was pointed out, that during the aforesaid period, when
			<lb />
			Jawaharlal Nehru (upto 27 th May, 1964), Gulzari Lal Nanda (upto 9 th
			<lb />
			June, 1964), Lal Bahadur Shastri (upto 11 th January,1966), Gulzari Lal
			<lb />
			Nanda (upto 24 th January, 1966) and Indira Gandhi (upto 1972) were
			<lb />
			running the executive and political governance in India, in their capacity
			<lb />
			as Prime Minister, had not taken any steps to dominate over the
			<lb />
			judiciary.
			<lb />
			Thereafter, two facts could not be digested by the
			<lb />
			political-executive leadership. The first, the abolition of the Privy Purses
			<lb />
			by an executive fiat, which was invalidated by the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			Madhavrao Scindia Bahadur v. Union of India 42 . And the second, the
			<lb />
			fundamental rights case, namely, the Kesavananda Bharati case 10 ,
			<lb />
			wherein the Supreme Court by a majority of 7:6, had propounded the
			<lb />
			doctrine of &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution, which limited the
			<lb />
			amending power of the Parliament, under Article 368. As a sequel to the
			<lb />
			above judgments, the executive attempted to intimidate the judiciary, by
			<lb />
			the first supersession in the Supreme Court on 25.4.1973. Thereafter,
			<lb />
			internal emergency was declared on 25.06.1975, which continued till
			<lb />
			21.03.1977. It was submitted, that during the emergency, by way of
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment(s), the power of judicial review vested in the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, was sought to be undermined. It was submitted, that
			<lb />
			the intrusion during the emergency came to be remedied when the
			<lb />
			Janata Party came to power on 22.03.1977, through the 43rd and 44th
			<lb />
			Constitutional Amendments, which restored judicial review, to the
			<lb />
			original position provided for by the Constituent Assembly.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			46. It was submitted, that in the recent past also, the exercise of the
			<lb />
			power of judicial review had been inconvenient for the political-executive,
			<lb />
			as it resulted in exposing a series of scams. In this behalf, reference was
			<lb />
			made to two judgments rendered by this Court, i.e., Centre for Public
			<lb />
			Interest Litigation v. Union of India 43 , and Manohar Lal Sharma v.
			<lb />
			Principal Secretary 44 . It was submitted, that the executive and the
			<lb />
			legislature can never appreciate that the power of judicial review has
			<lb />
			been exercised by the higher judiciary, as a matter of public trust. As a
			<lb />
			sequel to the above two judgments, it was pointed out, that an amount of
			<lb />
			approximately Rupees two lakh crores (Rs. 20,00,00,00,00,000/-) was
			<lb />
			gained by the public exchequer, for just a few coal block allocations (for
			<lb />
			which reliance was placed on an article which had appeared in the Indian
			<lb />
			Express dated 10.3.2015). And an additional amount of Rupees one lakh
			<lb />
			ten thousand crores (Rs.11,00,00,00,00,000/-) was gained by the public
			<lb />
			exchequer from the spectrum auction (for which reliance was placed on
			<lb />
			an article in the Financial Express dated 25.03.2015). It was submitted,
			<lb />
			that the embarrassment faced by the political-executive, has over
			<lb />
			shadowed the monumental gains to the nation. It was contended, that
			<lb />
			the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, and the NJAC Act, were
			<lb />
			truthfully a political-executive device, to rein in the power of judicial
			<lb />
			review, to avoid such discomfiture.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			47. It was also contended, that while adjudicating upon the present
			<lb />
			controversy, it was imperative for this Court, to take into consideration
			<lb />
			the existing socio-political conditions, the ground realities pertaining to
			<lb />
			the awareness of the civil society, and the relevant surrounding
			<lb />
			circumstances. These components, according to learned counsel, were
			<lb />
			described as relevant considerations, for a meaningful judicial verdict in
			<lb />
			the V.G. Row case 40 . Referring to Shashikant Laxman Kale v. Union of
			<lb />
			India 45 , it was contended, that for determining the purpose or the object
			<lb />
			of the legislation, it was permissible for a Court to look into the
			<lb />
			circumstances which had prevailed at the time when the law was passed,
			<lb />
			and events which had necessitated the passing of the legislation.
			<lb />
			Referring to the judgment rendered by this Court, in Re: the Special
			<lb />
			Courts Bill, 1978 46 , learned counsel placed emphatic reliance on the
			<lb />
			following:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;106. The greatest trauma of our times, for a developing country of
			<lb />
			urgent yet tantalising imperatives, is the dismal, yet die-hard, poverty of
			<lb />
			the masses and the democratic, yet graft-riven, way of life of
			<lb />
			power-wielders. Together they blend to produce gross abuse geared to
			<lb />
			personal aggrandizement, suppression of exposure and a host of other
			<lb />
			horrendous, yet hidden, crimes by the summit executives, pro tem, the
			<lb />
			para-political manipulators and the abetting bureaucrats. And the rule of
			<lb />
			law hangs limp or barks but never bites. An anonymous poet sardonically
			<lb />
			projected the social dimension of this systemic deficiency:
			<lb />
			The law locks up both man and woman
			<lb />
			Who steals the goose from off the common,
			<lb />
			But lets the greater felon loose
			<lb />
			Who steals the common from the goose.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			107. The impact of &apos;summit&apos; crimes in the Third World setting is more
			<lb />
			terrible than the Watergate syndrome as perceptive social scientists have
			<lb />
			unmasked. Corruption and repression-cousins in such situations-hijack
			<lb />
			developmental processes. And, in the long run, lagging national progress
			<lb />
			means ebbing people&apos;s confidence in constitutional means to social
			<lb />
			justice. And so, to track down and give short shrift to these heavy-weight
			<lb />
			criminaloids who often mislead the people by public moral weight-lifting
			<lb />
			and multipoint manifestoes is an urgent legislative mission partially
			<lb />
			undertaken by the Bill under discussion. To punish such super-offenders
			<lb />
			in top positions, sealing off legalistic escape routes and dilatory strategies
			<lb />
			and bringing them to justice with high speed and early finality, is a
			<lb />
			desideratum voiced in vain by Commissions and Committees in the past
			<lb />
			and is a dimension of the dynamics of the Rule of Law. This Bill,
			<lb />
			hopefully but partially, breaks new ground contrary to people&apos;s resigned
			<lb />
			cynicism
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			all
			<lb />
			high-powered
			<lb />
			investigations,
			<lb />
			reports
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			recommendations end in legislative and judicative futility, that all these
			<lb />
			valiant exercises are but sound and fury signifying nothing, that
			<lb />
			&apos;business as usual&apos; is the signature tune of public business, heretofore,
			<lb />
			here and hereafter. So this social justice measure has my broad assent in
			<lb />
			moral principle and in constitutional classification, subject to the serious
			<lb />
			infirmities from which it suffers as the learned Chief Justice has tersely
			<lb />
			sketched. Whether this remedy will effectively cure the malady of criminal
			<lb />
			summitry is for the future to tell.
			<lb />
			108. All this serves as a backdrop. Let me unfold in fuller argumentation
			<lb />
			my thesis that the Bill, good so far as it goes, is bad so far as it does not
			<lb />
			go-saved though by a pragmatic exception I will presently explain. Where
			<lb />
			the proposed law excludes the pre-and post-emergency crime-doers in
			<lb />
			the higher brackets and picks out only &apos;Emergency&apos; offenders, its benign
			<lb />
			purpose perhaps becomes a crypto cover up of like criminals before and
			<lb />
			after. An &apos;ephemeral&apos; measure to meet a perennial menace is neither a
			<lb />
			logical step nor national fulfilment. The classification, if I may anticipate
			<lb />
			my conclusion, is on the brink of constitutional break-down at that point
			<lb />
			and becomes almost vulnerable to the attack of Article 14.

			114. The crucial test is &apos;All power is a trust&apos;, its holders are &apos;accountable
			<lb />
			for its exercise&apos;, for &apos;from the people, and for the people, all springs, and
			<lb />
			all must exist&apos;. By this high and only standard the Bill must fail morally if
			<lb />
			it exempts non-Emergency criminals about whom prior Commission
			<lb />
			Reports, now asleep in official pigeon holes, bear witness and future
			<lb />
			Commission Reports (who knows?) may, in time, testify. In this larger
			<lb />
			perspective, Emergency is not a substantial differentia and the Bill nearly
			<lb />
			recognises this by ante-dating the operation to February 27, 1975 when
			<lb />
			there was no &apos;Emergency&apos;. Why ante-date if the &apos;emergency&apos; was the
			<lb />
			critical criterion?
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			117. Let us take a close look at the &apos;Emergency&apos;, the vices it bred and the
			<lb />
			nexus they have to speedier justice, substantial enough to qualify for
			<lb />
			reasonable sub-classification. Information flowing from the proceedings
			<lb />
			and reports of a bunch of high-powered judicial commissions shows that
			<lb />
			during that hushed spell, many suffered shocking treatment. In the
			<lb />
			words of the Preamble, civil liberties were withdrawn to a great extent,
			<lb />
			important fundamental rights of the people were suspended, strict
			<lb />
			censorship on the press was placed and judicial powers were curtailed to
			<lb />
			a large extent.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />

			<lb />

			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			128. Let us view the problem slightly differently. Even if liberty had not
			<lb />
			been curtailed, press not gagged or writ jurisdiction not cut down,
			<lb />
			criminal trials and appeals and revisions would have taken their own
			<lb />
			interminable delays. It is the forensic delay that has to be axed and that
			<lb />
			has little to do with the vices of the Emergency. Such crimes were
			<lb />
			exposed by judicial commissions before, involving Chief Ministers and
			<lb />
			Cabinet Ministers at both levels and no criminal action followed except
			<lb />
			now and that of a select group. It was lack of will-not Emergency-that
			<lb />
			was the villain of the piece in non-prosecution of cases revealed by
			<lb />
			several Commissions like the Commission of Enquiry appointed by the
			<lb />
			Government of Orissa in 1967 (Mr. Justice Khanna), the Commission of
			<lb />
			Enquiry appointed by the Government of J&amp;K in 1965 (Mr. Justice
			<lb />
			Rajagopala Ayyangar), the Mudholkar Commission against 14 ex-United
			<lb />
			Front Ministers appointed by the Government of Bihar in 1968 and the
			<lb />
			T.L. Venkatarama Aiyar Commission of Inquiry appointed by the
			<lb />
			Government of Bihar, 1970-to mention but some. We need hardly say
			<lb />
			that there is no law of limitation for criminal prosecutions. Somehow, a
			<lb />
			few manage to be above the law and the many remain below the law.
			<lb />
			How? -I hesitate to state.&quot;
			<lb />
			Last of all, reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in
			<lb />
			Subramanian Swamy v. Director, Central Bureau of Investigation 47 ,
			<lb />
			wherein this Court extensively referred to the conditions regarding
			<lb />
			corruption which prevailed in the country. For the above purpose, it took
			<lb />
			into consideration the view expressed by the N.N. Vohra Committee
			<lb />
			Report, bringing out the nexus between the criminal syndicates and
			<lb />
			mafia.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			48. Reliance was, then placed on the efforts made by the executive on
			<lb />
			the death of the first Chief Justice of India (after the promulgation of the
			<lb />
			Constitution), when Patanjali Sastri, J., who was the senior most Judge,
			<lb />
			was sought to be overlooked. Relying on recorded texts in this behalf, by
			<lb />
			Granville Austin, George H. Gadbois Jr. and M.C. Chagla, it was
			<lb />
			submitted, that all the six Judges, at that time, had threatened to resign,
			<lb />
			if the senior most Judge was overlooked for appointment as Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			49. Referring to the first occasion, when the convention was broken, by
			<lb />
			appointing A.N. Ray, J., as the Chief Justice of India, it was submitted,
			<lb />
			that the supersession led to public protest, including speeches by former
			<lb />
			Judges, former Attorneys General, legal luminaries and members of the
			<lb />
			Bar, throughout the country. M. Hidayatullah, CJ., in a public speech,
			<lb />
			complimented the three Judges, who were superseded, for having
			<lb />
			resigned from their office, immediately on the appointment of A.N. Ray,
			<lb />
			as Chief Justice of India. In the speech delivered by M. Hidayatullah, CJ.,
			<lb />
			he made a reference about rumors being afloat, that the senior most
			<lb />
			Judge after him, namely, J.C. Shah, J., would not succeed him as the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India. And that, an outsider was being brought to the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court, as its Chief Justice. His speech highlighted the fact, that
			<lb />
			all except one sitting Judge of the Supreme Court had agreed to resign in
			<lb />
			the event of supersession of J.C. Shah, J.. He had also pointed out, in
			<lb />
			his speech, that if the decision was taken by the executive, even a day
			<lb />
			before his retirement, he too would join his colleagues in resigning from
			<lb />
			his position as the Chief Justice of India. It was accordingly submitted,
			<lb />
			that the constitutional convention, that the senior most Judge of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court would be appointed as the Chief Justice of India, was
			<lb />
			truly and faithfully recognized as an impregnable convention. To support
			<lb />
			the aforesaid contention, it was also pointed out, that even in situations
			<lb />
			wherein the senior most puisne Judge would have a very short tenure,
			<lb />
			the convention had remained unbroken, despite the inefficacy of making
			<lb />
			such appointments. In this behalf, the Court&apos;s attention was drawn to
			<lb />
			the fact that J.C. Shah, CJ. (had a tenure of 35 days), K.N. Singh, CJ.
			<lb />
			(had a tenure of 18 days) and S. Rajendra Babu, CJ. (had a tenure of 29
			<lb />
			days).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			50. It was also the contention of the learned senior counsel, that the
			<lb />
			executive is an important litigant and stakeholder before the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, and as such, the executive ought to have no role, whatsoever,
			<lb />
			in the matter of appointments/transfers of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary. In this behalf, learned counsel placed reliance on a number of
			<lb />
			judgments rendered by this Court, wherein the participation of the
			<lb />
			executive in the higher judiciary, had been held to be unconstitutional, in
			<lb />
			the matter of appointments of Judges and other Members of tribunals,
			<lb />
			vested with quasi judicial functions. It was submitted, that the inclusion
			<lb />
			of the Union Minister in charge of Law and Justice in the NJAC, was a
			<lb />
			clear breach of the judgments rendered by this Court. Additionally, it
			<lb />
			was pointed out, that two &quot;eminent persons&quot;, who were to be essential
			<lb />
			components of the NJAC, were to be selected by a Committee, wherein
			<lb />
			the dominating voice was that of the political leadership. It was pointed
			<lb />
			out, that in the three-Member Committee authorised to nominate
			<lb />
			&quot;eminent persons&quot; included the Prime Minister and the Leader of the
			<lb />
			Opposition in the Lok Sabha, besides the Chief Justice of India. It was
			<lb />
			therefore submitted, that in the six-Member NJAC, three Members would
			<lb />
			have political-executive lineage. This aspect of the matter, according to
			<lb />
			the learned counsel, would have a devastating affect. It would negate
			<lb />
			primacy of the higher judiciary, and the same would result in
			<lb />
			undermining the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. Based on the above
			<lb />
			foundation, learned senior counsel raised a number of contentions.
			<lb />
			Firstly, it was submitted, that through the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment and the NJAC Act, the constitutional convention in this
			<lb />
			country, that the senior most Judge of the Supreme Court would be
			<lb />
			appointed as the Chief Justice of India, had been breached. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the above convention had achieved the status of a
			<lb />
			constitutional axiom -a constitutional principle. To substantiate the
			<lb />
			above contention, it was submitted, that right from 26.01.1950, the
			<lb />
			senior most puisne Judge of the Supreme Court has always been
			<lb />
			appointed as the Chief Justice of India except on two occasions. Firstly,
			<lb />
			the above convention was breached, when A.N. Ray, J., was appointed as
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India on 25.4.1973, by superseding three senior most
			<lb />
			Judges. It was submitted, that the aforesaid supersession was made on
			<lb />
			the day following the Supreme Court delivered the judgment in the
			<lb />
			Kesavananda Bharati case 10 . Secondly, the supersession took place
			<lb />
			during the internal emergency declared by Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi.
			<lb />
			At that juncture, M.H. Beg, J., was appointed as Chief Justice of India on
			<lb />
			29.1.1977, by superseding his senior H.R. Khanna, J.. It was contended,
			<lb />
			that the aforesaid two instances should be considered as aberrations, in
			<lb />
			the convention pertaining to appointment of Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			51. Mr. Arvind P. Datar also assailed the constitutional validity of
			<lb />
			Article 124C, introduced by the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act. It
			<lb />
			was submitted, that the Parliament was delegated with the authority to
			<lb />
			&quot;regulate the procedure for the appointment of the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			and other Judges of the Supreme Court, and the Chief Justices and other
			<lb />
			Judges of the High Courts&quot;. And the NJAC was empowered to lay down,
			<lb />
			by regulation, &quot;the procedure of discharging its own functions, the
			<lb />
			manner of selection of persons for appointment, and such other matters,
			<lb />
			as may be considered necessary by it&quot;. It was the contention of the
			<lb />
			learned counsel, that the delegation of power contemplated under Article
			<lb />
			124C, amounted to vesting the NJAC, with what was earlier vested with
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India. In this behalf, reference was also made to
			<lb />
			Sections 11, 12 and 13 of the NJAC Act. The power to make rules, has
			<lb />
			been vested with the Central Government under Section 11, and the
			<lb />
			power to make regulations has been entrusted to the NJAC under Section
			<lb />
			12. The aforementioned rules and regulations, as drawn by the Central
			<lb />
			Government/NJAC, are required to be placed before the Parliament
			<lb />
			under Section 13, and only thereafter, the rules and regulations were to
			<lb />
			be effective (or not to have any effect, or to have effect as modified). It
			<lb />
			was submitted, that the entrustment of the procedure of appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges to the higher judiciary, and also, the action of assigning the
			<lb />
			manner in which the NJAC would discharge its functions (of selecting
			<lb />
			Judges to the higher judiciary), with either the executive or the
			<lb />
			legislature, was unthinkable, if &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; was to be
			<lb />
			maintained. It was pointed out, that the intent behind Article 124C, in
			<lb />
			the manner it had been framed, stood clearly exposed, by the aforesaid
			<lb />
			provisions of the NJAC Act.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			52. Reference was also made to Section 12 of the NJAC Act, to
			<lb />
			highlight, that the NJAC had been authorized to notify in the Official
			<lb />
			Gazette, regulations framed by it, with the overriding condition, that the
			<lb />
			regulations so framed by the NJAC were to be consistent with the
			<lb />
			provisions of the NJAC Act, as also, the rules made thereunder (i.e.,
			<lb />
			under Section 11 of the NJAC Act). Having so empowered the NJAC
			<lb />
			(under Sections 11 and 12 referred to above), and having delineated in
			<lb />
			Section 12(2), the broad outlines with reference to which the regulations
			<lb />
			could be framed, it was submitted, that the power to delegate the
			<lb />
			authority to frame regulations clearly stood exhausted. In that, the
			<lb />
			Parliament had no jurisdiction thereafter, to interfere in the matter of
			<lb />
			framing regulations. In fact, according to the learned counsel,
			<lb />
			consequent upon the empowerment of the NJAC to frame regulations, the
			<lb />
			Parliament was rendered functus officio, on the issue of framing
			<lb />
			regulations. According to learned counsel, the above also established, the
			<lb />
			inference drawn in the foregoing paragraph.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			53. It was also the contention of the learned counsel, that the NJAC
			<lb />
			constituted, by way of the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, would be
			<lb />
			sustainable, so long as it did not violate the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. It was emphasized, that one of the recognized features of
			<lb />
			the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution was, the &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot;. The procedure which the NJAC could adopt for discharging its
			<lb />
			functions, and the procedure it was liable to follow while holding its
			<lb />
			meetings, and the ambit and scope with reference to which the NJAC was
			<lb />
			authorized to frame its regulations, had to be left to the exclusive
			<lb />
			independent will of an independent NJAC. That, according to learned
			<lb />
			counsel, would have ensured the &quot;independence of the NJAC&quot;. It was
			<lb />
			accordingly contended, that Article 124C breached the &quot;independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary&quot;, and also, undermined the independence of the NJAC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			54. The next contention advanced at the hands of the learned counsel,
			<lb />
			was with reference to clause (2) of Article 124A, whereby judicial review
			<lb />
			was barred, with reference to actions or proceedings of the NJAC, on the
			<lb />
			ground of the existence of a vacancy or defect in the constitution of the
			<lb />
			NJAC. Learned counsel then invited this Court&apos;s attention to the
			<lb />
			exclusion of the power of judicial review, contemplated under Articles
			<lb />
			323A(2)(d) and 323B(3)(d), wherein the power of judicial review was
			<lb />
			similarly excluded. It was submitted, that this Court struck down a
			<lb />
			similar provision in the aforesaid Articles, holding that the same were
			<lb />
			violative of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution. In this behalf,
			<lb />
			learned counsel placed reliance on the decision of this Court in the
			<lb />
			Kihoto Hollohan case 34 , and referred to the following observations
			<lb />
			recorded therein:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;129. The unanimous opinion according to the majority as well as the
			<lb />
			minority is that Paragraph 7 of the Tenth Schedule enacts a provision for
			<lb />
			complete exclusion of judicial review including the jurisdiction of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court under Article 136 and of the High Courts under Articles
			<lb />
			226 and 227 of the Constitution and, therefore, it makes in terms and in
			<lb />
			effect a change in Articles 136, 226 and 227 of the Constitution which
			<lb />
			attracts the proviso to clause (2) of Article 368 of the Constitution; and,
			<lb />
			therefore, ratification by the specified number of State legislatures before
			<lb />
			the Bill was presented to the President for his assent was necessary, in
			<lb />
			accordance therewith. The majority view is that in the absence of such
			<lb />
			ratification by the State legislatures, it is Paragraph 7 alone of the Tenth
			<lb />
			Schedule which is unconstitutional; and it being severable from the
			<lb />
			remaining part of the Tenth Schedule, Paragraph 7 alone is liable to be
			<lb />
			struck down rendering the Speakers&apos; decision under Paragraph 6 that of
			<lb />
			a judicial tribunal amenable to judicial review by the Supreme Court and
			<lb />
			the High Courts under Articles 136, 226 and 227. The minority opinion is
			<lb />
			that the effect of invalidity of Paragraph 7 of the Tenth Schedule is to
			<lb />
			invalidate the entire Constitution (Fifty-second Amendment) Act, 1985
			<lb />
			which inserted the Tenth Schedule since the President&apos;s assent to the Bill
			<lb />
			without prior ratification by the State legislatures is non est. The
			<lb />
			minority view also is that Paragraph 7 is not severable from the
			<lb />
			remaining part of the Tenth Schedule and the Speaker not being an
			<lb />
			independent adjudicatory authority for this purpose as contemplated by
			<lb />
			a basic feature of democracy, the remaining part of the Tenth Schedule is
			<lb />
			in excess of the amending powers being violative of a basic feature of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. In the minority opinion, we have held that the entire
			<lb />
			Constitution (Fifty-second Amendment) Act, 1985 is unconstitutional and
			<lb />
			an abortive attempt to make the constitutional amendment indicated
			<lb />
			therein.&quot;
			<lb />
			Reliance was also placed on the following conclusions recorded by this
			<lb />
			Court in Dr. Kashinath G. Jalmi v. The Speaker 48 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;43. In Kihoto Hollohan there was no difference between the majority
			<lb />
			and minority opinions on the nature of finality attaching to the Speaker&apos;s
			<lb />
			order of disqualification made under para 6 of the Tenth Schedule, and
			<lb />
			also that para 7 therein was unconstitutional in view of the
			<lb />
			non-compliance of the proviso to clause 2 of Article 368 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, by which judicial review was sought to be excluded. The
			<lb />
			main difference in the two opinions was, that according to the majority
			<lb />
			opinion this defect resulted in the constitution standing amended from
			<lb />
			the inception with insertion of the Tenth Schedule minus para 7 therein,
			<lb />
			while according to the minority the entire exercise of constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment was futile and an abortive attempt to amend the
			<lb />
			constitution, since Para 7 was not severable. According to the minority
			<lb />
			view, all decisions rendered by the several Speakers under the Tenth
			<lb />
			Schedule were, therefore, nullity and liable to be ignored. According to
			<lb />
			the majority view, para 7 of the Tenth Schedule being unconstitutional
			<lb />
			and severable, the Tenth Schedule minus para 7 was validly enacted and,
			<lb />
			therefore, the orders made by the Speaker under the Tenth Schedule
			<lb />
			were not nullity but subject to judicial review. On the basis of the
			<lb />
			majority opinion, this Court has exercised the power of judicial review
			<lb />
			over the orders of disqualification made by the speakers from the very
			<lb />
			inception of the Tenth Schedule, and the exercise of judicial review has
			<lb />
			not been confined merely to the orders of disqualification made after 12th
			<lb />
			November, 1991 when the judgment in Kihoto Hollohan (1992 (1) SCC
			<lb />
			309…) was rendered. Venkatachaliah, J. (as he then was) wrote the
			<lb />
			majority opinion and, thereafter, on this premise, exercised the power of
			<lb />
			judicial review over orders of disqualification made prior to 12.11.1991.
			<lb />
			The basic fallacy in the submission made on behalf of the respondents
			<lb />
			that para 7 must be treated as existing till 12th November, 1991 is that
			<lb />
			on that view there would be no power of judicial review against an order
			<lb />
			of disqualification made by the Speaker prior to 12th November, 1991
			<lb />
			since para 7 in express terms totally excludes judicial review.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			It was, therefore, the vehement contention of the learned counsel, that
			<lb />
			clause (2) of Article 124A should be struck down, as being violative of the
			<lb />
			&quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			55. Mr. Fali S. Nariman, learned senior counsel, also raised a purely
			<lb />
			technical plea. It was his contention, that 121st Constitution Amendment
			<lb />
			Bill, now the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, was introduced in the
			<lb />
			Lok Sabha on 11 th of August, 2014 and was passed by the Lok Sabha on
			<lb />
			13 th of August, 2014. It was further submitted, that the 121st
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Bill was discussed and passed by Rajya Sabha
			<lb />
			on 14.8.2014. Thereupon, the said Amendment Bill, which envisaged a
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment, was sent to the State Legislatures for
			<lb />
			ratification. Consequent upon its having been ratified by 16 State
			<lb />
			Legislatures, it was placed before the President for his assent. It was
			<lb />
			pointed out, that the President accorded his assent on 31.12.2014,
			<lb />
			whereupon, it became the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act. Learned
			<lb />
			counsel then invited our attention to Section 1 of the Constitution (99th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, which reads as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;1(1) This Act may be called the Constitution (Ninety-ninth Amendment)
			<lb />
			Act, 2014.
			<lb />
			(2) It shall come into force on such date as the Central Government may,
			<lb />
			by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint.&quot;
			<lb />
			Based on the aforesaid provision, it was contended, that in spite of
			<lb />
			having received the assent of the President on 31.12.2014, the
			<lb />
			Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, would not come into force
			<lb />
			automatically. And that, the same would come into force in terms of the
			<lb />
			mandate contained in Section 1(2), -&quot;… on such date as the Central
			<lb />
			Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint.&quot; It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the Central Government notified the Constitution (99th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, in the Gazette of India Extraordinary on 13.4.2015.
			<lb />
			Based on the aforesaid factual position, the Constitution (99th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, came into force with effect from 13.4.2015.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			56. In conjunction with the factual position noticed in the foregoing
			<lb />
			paragraph, learned counsel pointed out, that the NJAC Bill, was also
			<lb />
			introduced in the Lok Sabha on 11.8.2014. The Lok Sabha passed the
			<lb />
			Bill on 13.8.2014, whereupon, it was passed by the Rajya Sabha on
			<lb />
			14.8.2014. Thereafter, the NJAC Bill received the assent of the President
			<lb />
			on 31.12.2014, and became the NJAC Act. It was contended, that the
			<lb />
			enactment of the NJAC Act was based/founded on the Constitution (99th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act. It was submitted, that since the Constitution (99th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, was brought into force on 13.4.2015, the consideration
			<lb />
			of the NJAC Bill and the passing of the NJAC Act prior to the coming into
			<lb />
			force of the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, would render it stillborn
			<lb />
			and therefore nugatory. The Court&apos;s attention was also invited to the fact,
			<lb />
			that the aforesaid legal infirmity, was noticed and raised during the
			<lb />
			course of the parliamentary debate pertaining to the NJAC Bill, before the
			<lb />
			Rajya Sabha. Learned counsel invited this Court&apos;s attention to the
			<lb />
			following questions and answers, which are recorded on pages 442 to 533
			<lb />
			with reference to the debates in the Rajya Sabha on 13.8.2014, and at
			<lb />
			pages 229 to 375 on 14.8.2014 (Volume 232 No.26 and 27), as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;that Mr. Sitaram Yechury, Member of Parliament, (Rajya Sabha) raised a
			<lb />
			constitutional objection (on August 13, 2014) to the NJAC Bill saying:
			<lb />
			&quot;…….till the Constitution Amendment (121 st Bill) comes into effect, the
			<lb />
			Legislature, I would like to humbly submit, does not have the right to
			<lb />
			enact a Bill for the creation of a Judicial Commission for appointments.&quot;
			<lb />
			(page 488)
			<lb />
			&quot;……..I am only asking you to seriously consider we are creating a
			<lb />
			situation where this proposal for creation of a Judicial Appointments
			<lb />
			Commission will become ultra vires of the Indian Constitution because
			<lb />
			our right to bring about a Bill to enact such a provision comes only after
			<lb />
			the Constitution Amendment Bill becomes effective.&quot; (page 489)
			<lb />
			&quot;……..Therefore, you please consider what I am saying with seriousness.
			<lb />
			I want also the law Minister to consider it. Let it not be struck down later
			<lb />
			as ultra vires . So, let us give it a proper consideration.&quot; (Page-490)
			<lb />
			-The Leader of the Opposition (Shri Ghulam Nabi Azad) then said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The leader of the opposition (Shri Ghulam Nabi Azad): Sir, I just want to
			<lb />
			say that Mr. Yechury has given a totally different dimension to the entire
			<lb />
			thing. It is quite an eye opener for all of us that the entire legislation will
			<lb />
			become ultr vires. So, my suggestion is that before my colleague, Mr.
			<lb />
			Anand Sharma, speaks, I would request one thing. Of course, we have
			<lb />
			great lawyers from all sides here but I think one of the oldest luminaries
			<lb />
			in the legal profession is Mr. Parasaran. Before we all decide what to do,
			<lb />
			can we request him to throw light on what Mr. Yechury has said?
			<lb />
			(Page-490)
			<lb />
			-Mr. K. Parasaran (Nominated Member) then gave his views saying:
			<lb />
			Shri K. Parasarn (contd.)...Before ratification, if you take up the Bill and
			<lb />
			pass the Bill, today, it will be unconstitutional and ultra vires. Because
			<lb />
			the power to make enactment, as we see, is only in the Articles. The
			<lb />
			Article 368 gives the power to ….
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			Mr. Deputy Chairman: What I want to know is this. You have mentioned
			<lb />
			that there are two provisions. Number one, if it is amended in a
			<lb />
			particular way, it can directly go to the President. If the amendment
			<lb />
			involves Chapter IV, part 5, or Chapter V, etc., etc., it has to be ratified
			<lb />
			by half in the Assemblies. Okay. I accept both of them. But do any of
			<lb />
			these objections object us from considering this Bill now? That is my
			<lb />
			question.
			<lb />
			Shri K. Parasaran: No. We don&apos;t have the legislative competence.
			<lb />
			(Page-492)
			<lb />
			-The Minister of Law and Justice then said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;…..This Bill will become effective after ratification but the separate Bill is
			<lb />
			for guidance to the Legislatures as to how the entire structure has come
			<lb />
			into existence. Therefore, it is not unconstitutional. We have got
			<lb />
			summary power under Article 246 read with Entries 77 and 78, which is
			<lb />
			not a limited power. It is a plenary power, exhaustive power. This
			<lb />
			Parliament can pass any law with regard to composition and organization
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court; this Parliament can pass any law with regard to
			<lb />
			High Court composition. That is not a limited power. ……..&quot; (Page-495)
			<lb />
			Mr. Deputy Chairman: Yes, I will come ….(interruptions)….
			<lb />
			Now, Mr. Minister, the point is that you yourself admit that only after 50
			<lb />
			per cent of the Assemblies have endorsed it by a Resolution can your Bill
			<lb />
			come into force, and after the President has given assent. And then, you
			<lb />
			are saying that the Bill was passed along with this only as a guideline, so
			<lb />
			that Members of the Assemblies know what you are going to do.
			<lb />
			Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad: But it would become effective after assent.
			<lb />
			That is all.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Mr. Deputy Chairman: That&apos;s what I am saying. It will become effective
			<lb />
			after six months.
			<lb />
			Now, I would like to know one thing from Mr. Parasaran. Article 246,
			<lb />
			according to him, (the Minister) gives absolute powers to Parliament to
			<lb />
			pass a legislation. Is there any provision in the Constitution, which
			<lb />
			prevents passing of such a Bill before the Constitutional Amendment is
			<lb />
			endorsed by the President? Is there any such provision? …(interruptions)
			<lb />
			…. I will come to you. Yes, Mr. Parasaran. (Page-495)
			<lb />
			-In response Mr. K. Parasaran then said:
			<lb />
			&quot;Shri K. Parasaran: Sir, I would explain this. Now, we are concerned with
			<lb />
			Article 124 and a legislation under Article 246 read with the relevant
			<lb />
			entries in the Seventh Schedule, pointed out by the Hon. Minister. Now,
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court has interpreted Article 124. We cannot pass an Act
			<lb />
			contrary to that judgment and, therefore, the need for amendment to the
			<lb />
			constitution. If the Constitution is not amended, then we lack the
			<lb />
			legislative competence. There is no good of going to Article 246 and
			<lb />
			reading the entries. Had we the legislative competence, under Article 246
			<lb />
			read with the entries…. (Emphasis supplied) page 495.
			<lb />
			Mr. Deputy Chairman: Then, how do you explain Article 246?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			Shri K. Parasaran: Suppose the Constitutional Amendment is passed,
			<lb />
			then can this Bill be introduced and discussed as it is? As a hypothetical
			<lb />
			case, if this Amendment Bill is not passed, can we introduce this Bill and
			<lb />
			pass it? We will not be able to do it.&quot; (Emphasis supplied) (Page-496).&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			57. In other words, it was the contention of the learned counsel, that
			<lb />
			the NJAC Bill was passed by both Houses of Parliament, when
			<lb />
			Parliament had no power, authority or jurisdiction to consider such a
			<lb />
			Bill, in the teeth of Articles 124(2) and 217(1), as enacted in the original
			<lb />
			Constitution. It was submitted, that the passing of the said Bill, was in
			<lb />
			itself unconstitutional, ultra vires and void, because the amended
			<lb />
			provisions contained in the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, had not
			<lb />
			come into play. It was submitted, that the passing by the Lok Sabha, as
			<lb />
			also, by the Rajya Sabha of the 121st Constitution Amendment Bill on
			<lb />
			13/14.8.2014, and the ratification thereof by 16 State Legislatures, as
			<lb />
			also, the assent given thereto by the President on 31.12.2014, would not
			<lb />
			bestow validity on the NJAC Act. This, for the simple reason, that the
			<lb />
			Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, was brought into force only on
			<lb />
			13.4.2015. In the above view of the matter, according to the learned
			<lb />
			counsel, till 13.4.2015, Articles 124(2) and 217(1) of the Constitution of
			<lb />
			India were liable to be read, as they were originally enacted. In the
			<lb />
			aforesaid context, it was submitted, that the NJAC Act could not have
			<lb />
			been passed, till the unamended provisions of the Constitution were in
			<lb />
			force. And that, the mere assent of the President to the NJAC Act on
			<lb />
			31.12.2014, could not infuse validity thereon.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			58. In order to substantiate the aforesaid contention, learned counsel
			<lb />
			placed reliance on A.K. Roy v. Union of India 49 , and invited our attention
			<lb />
			to the following:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;45 The argument arising out of the provisions of Article 368(2) may be
			<lb />
			considered first. It provides that when a Bill whereby the Constitution is
			<lb />
			amended is passed by the requisite majority, it shall be presented to the
			<lb />
			President who shall give his assent to the Bill, &quot;and thereupon the
			<lb />
			Constitution shall stand amended in accordance with the terms of the
			<lb />
			Bill.&quot; This provision shows that a constitutional amendment cannot have
			<lb />
			any effect unless the President gives his assent to it and secondly, that
			<lb />
			nothing more than the President&apos;s assent to an amendment duly passed
			<lb />
			by the Parliament is required, in order that the Constitution should stand
			<lb />
			amended in accordance with the terms of the Bill. It must follow from
			<lb />
			this that the Constitution stood amended in accordance with the terms of
			<lb />
			the 44th Amendment Act when the President gave his assent to that Act
			<lb />
			on April 30, 1979. We must then turn to that Act for seeing how and in
			<lb />
			what manner the Constitution stood thus amended. The 44th
			<lb />
			Amendment Act itself prescribes by Section 1(2) a pre-condition which
			<lb />
			must be satisfied before any of its provisions can come into force. That
			<lb />
			pre-condition is the issuance by the Central Government of a notification
			<lb />
			in the official gazette, appointing the date from which the Act or any
			<lb />
			particular provision thereof will come into force, with power to appoint
			<lb />
			different dates for different provisions. Thus, according to the very terms
			<lb />
			of the 44th Amendment, none of its provisions can come into force unless
			<lb />
			and until the Central Government issues a notification as contemplated
			<lb />
			by Section 1(2).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			46. There is no internal contradiction between the provisions of
			<lb />
			Article 368(2) and those of Section 1(2) of the 44th Amendment Act.
			<lb />
			Article 368(2) lays down a rule of general application as to the date from
			<lb />
			which the Constitution would stand amended in accordance with the Bill
			<lb />
			assented to by the President. Section 1(2) of the Amendment Act specifies
			<lb />
			the manner in which that Act or any of its provisions may be brought
			<lb />
			into force. The distinction is between the Constitution standing amended
			<lb />
			in accordance with the terms of the Bill assented to by the President and
			<lb />
			the date of the coming into force of the Amendment thus introduced into
			<lb />
			the Constitution. For determining the date with effect from which the
			<lb />
			Constitution stands amended in accordance with the terms of the Bill,
			<lb />
			one has to turn to the date on which the President gave, or was obliged to
			<lb />
			give, his assent to the Amendment. For determining the date with effect
			<lb />
			from which the Constitution, as amended, came or will come into force,
			<lb />
			one has to turn to the notification, if any, issued by the Central
			<lb />
			Government under Section 1(2) of the Amendment Act.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			47. The Amendment Act may provide that the amendment introduced
			<lb />
			by it shall come into force immediately upon the President giving his
			<lb />
			assent to the Bill or it may provide that the amendment shall come into
			<lb />
			force on a future date. Indeed, no objection can be taken to the
			<lb />
			constituent body itself appointing a specific future date with effect from
			<lb />
			which the Amendment Act will come into force; and if that be so, different
			<lb />
			dates can be appointed by it for bringing into force different provisions of
			<lb />
			the Amendment Act. The point of the matter is that the Constitution
			<lb />
			standing amended in accordance with the terms of the Bill and the
			<lb />
			amendment thus introduced into the Constitution coming into force are
			<lb />
			two distinct things. Just as a law duly passed by the legislature can have
			<lb />
			no effect unless it comes or is brought into force, similarly, an
			<lb />
			amendment of the Constitution can have no effect unless it comes or is
			<lb />
			brought into force. The fact that the constituent body may itself specify a
			<lb />
			future date or dates with effect from which the Amendment Act or any of
			<lb />
			its provisions will come into force shows that there is no antithesis
			<lb />
			between Article 368(2) of the Constitution and Section 1(2) of the 44th
			<lb />
			Amendment Act. The expression of legislative or constituent will as
			<lb />
			regards the date of enforcement of the law or Constitution is an integral
			<lb />
			part thereof. That is why it is difficult to accept the submission that,
			<lb />
			contrary to the expression of the constituent will, the amendments
			<lb />
			introduced by the 44th Amendment Act came into force on April 30, 1979
			<lb />
			when the President gave his assent to that Act. The true position is that
			<lb />
			the amendments introduced by the 44th Amendment Act did not become
			<lb />
			a part of the Constitution on April 30, 1979. They will acquire that status
			<lb />
			only when the Central Government brings them into force by issuing a
			<lb />
			notification under Section 1(2) of the Amendment Act.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			59. It was also the contention of Mr. Fali S. Nariman, that just as a
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment was liable to be declared as ultra vires, if it
			<lb />
			violated and/or abrogated, the &quot;core&quot; or the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution; even a simple legislative enactment, which violated the
			<lb />
			&quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution, was liable to be declared as
			<lb />
			unconstitutional. For the instant proposition, learned counsel referred to
			<lb />
			the Madras Bar Association case 35 , and placed reliance on the following
			<lb />
			observations recorded therein:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;109. Even though we have declined to accept the contention advanced
			<lb />
			on behalf of the Petitioners, premised on the &quot;basic structure&quot; theory, we
			<lb />
			feel it is still essential for us, to deal with the submission advanced on
			<lb />
			behalf
		</p>
		<item>
			of the respondents in response. We may first record the contention
			<lb />
			advanced on behalf of the respondents. It was contended, that a
			<lb />
			legislation (not being an amendment to the Constitution), enacted in
			<lb />
			consonance of the provisions of the Constitution, on a subject within the
			<lb />
			realm of the legislature concerned, cannot be assailed on the ground that
			<lb />
			it violates the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution. For the present
			<lb />
			controversy,
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			respondents
			<lb />
			had
			<lb />
			placed
			<lb />
			reliance
			<lb />
			on
			<lb />
			Articles 245 and 246 of the Constitution, as also, on entries 77 to 79, 82
			<lb />
			to 84, 95 and 97 of the Union List of the Seventh Schedule, and on
			<lb />
			entries 11-A and 46 of the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule.
			<lb />
			Based thereon it was asserted, that Parliament was competent to enact
			<lb />
			the NTT Act. For examining the instant contention, let us presume it is
			<lb />
			so. Having accepted the above, our consideration is as follows. The
			<lb />
			Constitution regulates the manner of governance in substantially minute
			<lb />
			detail. It is the fountainhead distributing power, for such governance.
			<lb />
			The Constitution vests the power of legislation at the Centre, with the Lok
			<lb />
			Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, and in the States with the State Legislative
			<lb />
			Assemblies (and in some States, the State Legislative Councils, as well).
			<lb />
			The instant legislative power is regulated by &quot;Part XI&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			The submission advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			respondents, insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, is
			<lb />
			premised on the assertion that the NTT Act has been enacted strictly in
			<lb />
			consonance with the procedure depicted in &quot;Part XI&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			It is also the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents, that
			<lb />
			the said power has been exercised strictly in consonance with the subject
			<lb />
			on which the Parliament is authorized to legislate. Whilst dealing with the
			<lb />
			instant submission advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			respondents, all that needs to be stated is, that the legislative power
			<lb />
			conferred under &quot;Part XI&quot; of the Constitution has one overall exception,
			<lb />
			which undoubtedly is, that the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution,
			<lb />
			cannot be infringed, no matter what. On the instant aspect some relevant
			<lb />
			judgments rendered by Constitutional Benches of this Court, have been
			<lb />
			cited hereinabove. It seems to us, that there is a fine difference in what
			<lb />
			the petitioners contend, and what the respondents seek to project. The
			<lb />
			submission advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			petitioners does not pertain to lack of jurisdiction or inappropriate
			<lb />
			exercise of jurisdiction. The submission advanced at the hands of the
			<lb />
			learned counsel for the petitioners pointedly is, that it is impermissible to
			<lb />
			legislate in a manner as would violate the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. This Court has repeatedly held that an amendment to the
			<lb />
			provisions of the Constitution would not be sustainable if it violated the
			<lb />
			&quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution, even though the amendment had
			<lb />
			been carried out by following the procedure contemplated under &quot;Part XI&quot;
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. This leads to the determination that the &quot;basic
			<lb />
			structure&quot; is inviolable. In our view, the same would apply to all other
			<lb />
			legislations (other than amendments to the Constitution) as well, even
			<lb />
			though the legislation had been enacted by following the prescribed
			<lb />
			procedure, and was within the domain of the enacting legislature, any
			<lb />
			infringement to the &quot;basic structure&quot; would be unacceptable. Such
			<lb />
			submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			respondents are, therefore, liable to be disallowed, and are accordingly
			<lb />
			declined.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			60. Mr. Arvind P. Datar, learned senior counsel, assailed the
			<lb />
			constitutional validity of various provisions of the NJAC Act, by
			<lb />
			advancing the same submissions, as were relied upon by him while
			<lb />
			assailing the constitutional validity of Articles 124A, 124B and 124C. For
			<lb />
			reasons of brevity, the aforestated submissions noticed with reference to
			<lb />
			individual provisions of the NJAC Act are not being repeated again.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			61. A challenge was also raised, to the different provisions of the NJAC
			<lb />
			Act. First and foremost, a challenge was raised to the manner of
			<lb />
			selection of the Chief Justice of India. Section 5(1) of the NJAC Act, it
			<lb />
			was submitted, provides that the NJAC would recommend the senior
			<lb />
			most Judge of the Supreme Court, for being appointed as Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, subject to the condition, that he was considered &quot;fit&quot; to hold the
			<lb />
			office. It was contended, that the procedure to regulate the appointment
			<lb />
			of the Chief Justice of India, was to be determined by Parliament, by law
			<lb />
			under Article 124C. It was contended, that the term &quot;fit&quot;, expressed in
			<lb />
			Section 5 of the NJAC Act, had not been elaborately described. And as
			<lb />
			such, fitness would have to be determined on the subjective satisfaction
			<lb />
			of the Members of the NJAC. It was submitted, that even though the
			<lb />
			learned Attorney General had expressed, during the course of hearing,
			<lb />
			that fitness meant &quot;…mental and physical fitness alone…&quot;, it was always
			<lb />
			open to the Parliament to purposefully define fitness, in a manner as
			<lb />
			would sub-serve the will of the executive. It was submitted, that even an
			<lb />
			ordinance could be issued without the necessity, of following the
			<lb />
			procedure, of enacting law. It was asserted, that the criterion of fitness
			<lb />
			could be defined and redefined. It was submitted, that it was a
			<lb />
			constitutional convention, that the senior most Judge of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court would always be appointed as Chief Justice of India. And that, the
			<lb />
			aforesaid convention had remained unbroken, even though in some cases
			<lb />
			the tenure of the appointee, had been short, and as such, may not have
			<lb />
			enured to the advantage, of the judicial organization as a whole.
			<lb />
			Experience had shown, according to learned counsel, that adhering to
			<lb />
			the practice of appointing the senior most Judge as the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, had resulted in institutional harmony amongst Judges, which was
			<lb />
			extremely important for the health of the judiciary, and also, for the
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. It was submitted, that it would be just
			<lb />
			and appropriate, at the present juncture, to understand the width of the
			<lb />
			power, so as to prevent any likelihood of its misuse in future. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that various ways and means could be devised to supersede
			<lb />
			Judges, and also, to bring in favourites. Past experience had shown, that
			<lb />
			the executive had abused its authority, when it departed from the above
			<lb />
			rule in April 1973, by superseding J.M. Shelat, J., the senior most Judge
			<lb />
			and even the next two Judges in the order of seniority after him, namely,
			<lb />
			K.S. Hegde and A.N. Grover, and appointed the fourth senior most Judge
			<lb />
			A.N Ray, as the Chief Justice of India. Again in January 1977 on the
			<lb />
			retirement of A.N. Ray, CJ., the senior most Judge H.R. Khanna, was
			<lb />
			ignored, and the next senior most Judge, M.H. Beg, was appointed as the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India. Such control in the hands of the executive would
			<lb />
			cause immense inroads, in the decision making process. And could
			<lb />
			result in, Judges trying to placate and appease the executive, for
			<lb />
			personal gains and rewards.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			62. The submission noticed above was sought to be illustrated through
			<lb />
			the following instance. It was pointed out, that it would be genuine and
			<lb />
			legitimate for the Parliament to enact, that a person would be considered
			<lb />
			fit for appointment as Chief Justice of India, only if he had a minimum
			<lb />
			remaining tenure of at least two years. Such an enactment would have a
			<lb />
			devastating effect, even though it would appear to be innocuously
			<lb />
			legitimate. It was contended, that out of the 41 Chief Justices of India
			<lb />
			appointed till date, only 12 Chief Justices of India, had a tenure of more
			<lb />
			than two years. Such action, at the hands of the Parliament, was bound
			<lb />
			to cause discontentment to those, who had a legitimate expectation to
			<lb />
			hold the office of Chief Justice of India. It was submitted, that similar
			<lb />
			instances can be multiplied with dimensional alterations by prescribing
			<lb />
			different parameters. It was submitted, that the Parliament should never
			<lb />
			be allowed the right to create uncertainty, in the matter of selection and
			<lb />
			appointment of the Chief Justice of India, because the office of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India was pivotal, as it shouldered extremely serious and
			<lb />
			onerous responsibilities. The exercise of the above authority, it was
			<lb />
			pointed out, could/would seriously affect the &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot;. In the above context, reference was also made, to the opinion
			<lb />
			expressed by renowned persons, having vast experience in the judicial
			<lb />
			institution, effectively bringing out the veracity of the contention
			<lb />
			advanced. Reference in this regard was made to the observations of M.C.
			<lb />
			Chagla, in his book, &quot;Roses in December -An Autobiography&quot;, wherein
			<lb />
			he examined the impact of supersession on Judges, who by virtue of the
			<lb />
			existing convention, were in line to be the Chief Justice of India, but were
			<lb />
			overlooked by preferring a junior. Reference was also made to the
			<lb />
			opinion expressed by H.R. Khanna, J., (in his book -&quot;Neither Roses Nor
			<lb />
			Thorns&quot;). Finally, the Court&apos;s attention was drawn to the view expressed
			<lb />
			by H.M. Seervai (in &quot;Constitutional Law of India -A Critical
			<lb />
			Commentary&apos;). It was submitted, that leaving the issue of determination
			<lb />
			of fitness with the Parliament, was liable to fan the ambitions of Judges,
			<lb />
			and would make them loyal to those who could satisfy their ambitions. It
			<lb />
			was therefore the contention of the learned counsel, that Section 5,
			<lb />
			which created an ambiguity in the matter of appointment of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, and could be abused to imperil &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot;, was liable to be declared as unconstitutional.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			63. It was also the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners,
			<lb />
			that on the issue of selection and appointment of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, the NJAC was liable to take into consideration ability, merit
			<lb />
			and suitability (as may be specified by regulations). It was submitted,
			<lb />
			that the above criteria could be provided through regulations framed
			<lb />
			under Section 12(2)(a), (b) and (c). It was pointed out, that the regulations
			<lb />
			framed for determining the suitability of a Judge (with reference to ability
			<lb />
			and merit), would be synonymous with the conditions of eligibility.
			<lb />
			Inasmuch as, a candidate who did not satisfy the standards expressed in
			<lb />
			the regulations, would also not satisfy, the prescribed conditions of
			<lb />
			appointment. It was asserted, that it would be a misnomer to treat the
			<lb />
			same to be a matter of mere procedure. Thus viewed, it was contended,
			<lb />
			that the provisions of the NJAC Act, which laid down (or provided for the
			<lb />
			laying down) substantive conditions for appointment, was clearly beyond
			<lb />
			the purview of Article 124C, inasmuch as, under the above provision,
			<lb />
			Parliament alone had been authorised by law, to regulate the procedure
			<lb />
			for appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court, or to empower the
			<lb />
			NJAC to lay the same down by regulations, inter alia the manner of
			<lb />
			selection of persons for appointment, as Judges of the Supreme Court. It
			<lb />
			was submitted, that the NJAC Act, especially in terms of Section 5(2),
			<lb />
			had travelled far beyond the jurisdictional parameters contemplated
			<lb />
			under Article 124C.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			64. It was also contended, that while recommending names for
			<lb />
			appointment of a Judge to the Supreme Court, seniority in the cadre of
			<lb />
			Judges, was liable to be taken into consideration, in addition to ability
			<lb />
			and merit. It was submitted, that the instant mandate contained in the
			<lb />
			first proviso under Section 5(2) of the NJAC Act, clearly breached the
			<lb />
			&quot;federal structure&quot; of governance, which undoubtedly required regional
			<lb />
			representation in the Supreme Court. Since the &quot;federal structure&quot;
			<lb />
			contemplated in the Constitution was also one of the &quot;basic structures&quot;
			<lb />
			envisioned by the framers of the Constitution, the same could not have
			<lb />
			been overlooked.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			65. Besides the above, the Court&apos;s attention was invited to the second
			<lb />
			proviso, under Section 5(2) of the NJAC Act, which mandates that the
			<lb />
			NJAC would not make a favourable recommendation, if any two Members
			<lb />
			thereof, opposed the candidature of an individual. It was contended, that
			<lb />
			placing the power of veto, in the hands of any two Members of the NJAC,
			<lb />
			would violate the recommendatory power expressed in Article 124B. In
			<lb />
			this behalf, it was contended, that the second proviso under Section 5(2),
			<lb />
			would enable two eminent persons (-lay persons, if the submission
			<lb />
			advanced by the learned Attorney General is to be accepted) to defeat a
			<lb />
			unanimous opinion of the Chief Justice of India and the two senior most
			<lb />
			Judges of the Supreme Court. And thereby negate the primacy vested in
			<lb />
			the judiciary, in the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			66. It was submitted, that the above power of veto exercisable by two
			<lb />
			lay persons, or alternatively one lay person, in conjunction with the
			<lb />
			Union Minister in charge of Law and Justice, would cause a serious
			<lb />
			breach in the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. Most importantly, it was
			<lb />
			contended, that neither the impugned constitutional amendment, nor the
			<lb />
			provisions of the NJAC Act, provide for any quorum for holding the
			<lb />
			meetings of the NJAC. And as such (quite contrary to the contentions
			<lb />
			advanced at the hands of the learned Attorney General), it was
			<lb />
			contended, that a meeting of the NJAC could not be held, without the
			<lb />
			presence of the all Members of the NJAC. In order to support his above
			<lb />
			contention, he illustratively placed reliance on the Constitution (122nd
			<lb />
			Amendment) Bill, 2014 [brought before the Parliament, by the same
			<lb />
			ruling political party, which had successfully amended the Constitution
			<lb />
			by tabling the Constitution (121st Amendment) Bill, 2014]. The objective
			<lb />
			sought to be achieved through the Constitution (122nd Amendment) Bill,
			<lb />
			2014, was to insert Article 279A. The proposed Article 279A intended to
			<lb />
			create the Goods and Services Tax Council. Sub-Article (7) of Article
			<lb />
			279A postulated, that &quot;… One-half of the total number of Members of the
			<lb />
			Goods and Services Tax Council…&quot; would constitute the quorum for its
			<lb />
			meetings. And furthermore, that &quot;… Every decision of the Goods and
			<lb />
			Services Tax Council shall be taken at a meeting, by a majority of not less
			<lb />
			than three-fourths of the weighted votes of the members present and
			<lb />
			voting …&quot;. Having laid down the above parameters, in the Bill which
			<lb />
			followed the Bill that led to the promulgation of the Constitution (99th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, it was submitted, that the omission of providing for a
			<lb />
			quorum for the functioning of the NJAC, and the omission to quantify the
			<lb />
			strength required for valid decision making, was not innocent. And that,
			<lb />
			it vitiated the provision itself.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			III. RESPONDENTS&apos; RESPONSE, ON MERITS:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			67. The learned Attorney General commenced his response on merits
			<lb />
			by asserting, that there was no provision in the Constitution of India,
			<lb />
			either when it was originally drafted, or at any stage thereafter, which
			<lb />
			contemplated, that Judges would appoint Judges to the higher judiciary.
			<lb />
			It was accordingly asserted, that the appointment of Judges by Judges
			<lb />
			was foreign to the provisions of the Constitution. It was pointed out, that
			<lb />
			there were certain political upheavals, which had undermined the
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, including executive overreach, in the
			<lb />
			matter of appointment and transfer of Judges of the higher judiciary,
			<lb />
			starting with supersession of senior Judges of the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			1973, followed by, the mass transfer of Judges of the higher judiciary
			<lb />
			during the emergency in 1976, and thereafter, the second supersession of
			<lb />
			a senior Judge of the Supreme Court in 1977. It was acknowledged, that
			<lb />
			there was continuous interference by the executive, in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary during the 1980&apos;s. Despite
			<lb />
			thereof, whilst adjudicating upon the controversy in the First Judges case
			<lb />
			rendered in 1981, this Court, it was pointed out, had remained
			<lb />
			unimpressed, and reiterated the primacy of the executive, in the matter
			<lb />
			of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			68. It was pointed out, that the issue for reconsideration of the decision
			<lb />
			rendered in the First Judges case arose in Subhash Sharma v. Union of
			<lb />
			India 4 , wherein the questions considered were, whether the opinion of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India, in regard to the appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court and High Courts, as well as, transfer of High Court
			<lb />
			Judges, was entitled to primacy, and also, whether the matter of fixation
			<lb />
			of the judge-strength in High Courts, was justiciable? It was asserted,
			<lb />
			that the aforesaid two questions were placed for determination by a
			<lb />
			Constitution Bench of nine Judges (keeping in view the fact that the First
			<lb />
			Judges case, was decided by a seven-Judge Bench). It was asserted, that
			<lb />
			the decision rendered by this Court in the Second Judges case, was on
			<lb />
			the suo motu exercise of jurisdiction by this Court, wherein this Court
			<lb />
			examined matters far beyond the scope of the reference order. It was
			<lb />
			contended, that the Second Judges case was rendered, without the
			<lb />
			participation of all the stakeholders, inasmuch as, the controversy was
			<lb />
			raised at the behest of practicing advocates and associations of lawyers,
			<lb />
			and there was no other stakeholder involved during its hearing.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			69. It was asserted, that the judiciary had no jurisdiction to assume to
			<lb />
			itself, the role of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary. It was
			<lb />
			pointed out, that it is the Parliament alone, which represents the
			<lb />
			citizenry and the people of this country, and has the exclusive
			<lb />
			jurisdiction to legislate on matters. Accordingly, it was asserted, that the
			<lb />
			decisions in the Second and Third Judges cases, must be viewed as
			<lb />
			legislation without any jurisdictional authority.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			70. It was pointed out, that the issue relating to the amendment of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, pertaining to the subject of appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, through a Judicial Commission commenced with the
			<lb />
			Constitution (67 th Amendment) Bill, 1990. The Bill however lapsed. On
			<lb />
			the same subject, the Constitution (82nd Amendment) Bill, 1997 was
			<lb />
			introduced. The 1997 Bill, however, could not be passed. This was
			<lb />
			followed by the Constitution (98th Amendment) Bill, 2003 which was
			<lb />
			introduced when the present Government was in power. In 2003 itself, a
			<lb />
			National Commission was set up to review the working of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, followed by the Second Administrative Reforms Commission
			<lb />
			in 2007. Interspersed with the aforesaid events, were a number of Law
			<lb />
			Commission&apos;s Reports. The intention of the Parliament, since the
			<lb />
			introduction of the Bill in 1990, it was submitted, was aimed at setting
			<lb />
			up a National Judicial Commission, for appointment and transfer of
			<lb />
			Judges of the higher judiciary. It was pointed out, that no positive
			<lb />
			achievement was made in the above direction, for well over two decades.
			<lb />
			Mr. Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah, who headed the National Commission
			<lb />
			to review the working of the Constitution, had also recommended a
			<lb />
			five-Member National Judicial Commission, whereby, a wide consultative
			<lb />
			process was sought to be introduced, in the selection and appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges. It was submitted, that all along recommendations were made,
			<lb />
			for a participatory involvement of the executive, as well as the judiciary,
			<lb />
			in the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary. It was
			<lb />
			also pointed out, that the Constitution (98 th Amendment) Bill, 2003
			<lb />
			proposed a seven-Member National Judicial Commission. Thereafter, the
			<lb />
			Administrative Reforms Commission, proposed a eight-Member National
			<lb />
			Judicial Commission, to be headed by the Vice-President, and comprising
			<lb />
			of the Prime Minister, the Speaker, the Chief Justice of India, the Law
			<lb />
			Minister and two leaders of the Opposition. The aforesaid
			<lb />
			recommendation, was made by a Commission headed by Veerappa Moily,
			<lb />
			the then Union Law Minister. The present Constitution (99th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, 2014, whereby Article 124 has been amended and
			<lb />
			Articles 124A to 124C have been inserted in the Constitution,
			<lb />
			contemplates a six-Member National Judicial Commission.
			<lb />
			It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that there was no justification in finding anything wrong, in
			<lb />
			the composition of the NJAC. To point out the safeguards against entry of
			<lb />
			undesirable persons into the higher judiciary, it was emphasized, that
			<lb />
			only if five of the six Members of the NJAC recommended a candidate, he
			<lb />
			could be appointed to the higher judiciary. It was submitted, that the
			<lb />
			aforestated safeguards, postulated in the amended provisions, would not
			<lb />
			only ensure transparency, but would also render a broad based
			<lb />
			consideration.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			71. As a counter, to the submissions advanced on behalf of the
			<lb />
			petitioners, it was asserted, that the Parliament&apos;s power to amend the
			<lb />
			Constitution was plenary, subject to only one restriction, namely, that
			<lb />
			the Parliament could not alter the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			And as such, a constitutional amendment must be presumed to be
			<lb />
			constitutionally valid (unless shown otherwise). For the instant
			<lb />
			proposition, reliance was placed on Charanjit Lal Chowdhury v. Union of
			<lb />
			India 50 , Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Justice S.R. Tendolkar 51 , the
			<lb />
			Kesavananda Bharati case 10 , (specifically the view expressed by K.S.
			<lb />
			Hegde and A.K. Mukherjea, JJ.), B. Banerjee v. Anita Pan 52 , and
			<lb />
			Government of Andhra Pradesh v. P. Laxmi Devi 53 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			72. It was asserted, that the Parliament was best equipped to assess
			<lb />
			the needs of the people, and to deal with the changing times. For this,
			<lb />
			reliance was placed on Mohd. Hanif Quareshi v. State of Bihar 54 , State of
			<lb />
			West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar 55 . It was contended, that while enacting
			<lb />
			the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, and the NJAC Act, the
			<lb />
			Parliament had discharged a responsibility, which it owed to the citizens
			<lb />
			of this country, by providing for a meaningful process for the selection
			<lb />
			and appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			73. Referring to the decisions rendered by this Court in the Second and
			<lb />
			Third Judges cases, it was asserted, that the way he saw it, there was
			<lb />
			only one decipherable difference introduced in the process of selection
			<lb />
			contemplated through the NJAC. Under the system introduced, the
			<lb />
			judiciary could not &quot;insist&quot; on the appointment of an individual. But the
			<lb />
			judiciary continued to retain the veto power, to stop the appointment of
			<lb />
			an individual considered unworthy of appointment. According to him, the
			<lb />
			nomination of a candidate, for appointment to the higher judiciary, under
			<lb />
			the above judgments, could also not fructify, if any two members of the
			<lb />
			collegium, expressed an opinion against the nominated candidate. It was
			<lb />
			pointed out, that the above position had been retained in the impugned
			<lb />
			provisions. According to the learned Attorney General, the only difference
			<lb />
			in the impugned provisions was, that the right of the judiciary to &quot;insist&quot;
			<lb />
			on the appointment of a nominee, was no longer available to the
			<lb />
			judiciary. Under the collegium system, a recommendation made for
			<lb />
			appointment to the higher judiciary, could be returned by the executive
			<lb />
			for reconsideration. However, if the recommendation was reiterated, the
			<lb />
			executive had no choice, but to appoint the recommended nominee. It
			<lb />
			was pointed out, that the instant right to &quot;insist&quot; on the appointment of a
			<lb />
			Judge, had now been vested in the NJAC. It was vehemently contended,
			<lb />
			that the denial to &quot;insist&quot;, on the appointment of a particular nominee,
			<lb />
			would surely not undermine the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. The
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, according to the learned Attorney
			<lb />
			General, would be well preserved, if the right to &quot;reject&quot; a nominee was
			<lb />
			preserved with the judiciary, which had been done.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			74. Based on the aforesaid submission, it was asserted, that the
			<lb />
			process initiated by the Parliament in 1990 (for the introduction of a
			<lb />
			Commission, for appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary), had
			<lb />
			taken twenty-four years to fructify. The composition of the NJAC
			<lb />
			introduced through the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, according to
			<lb />
			him, meets with all constitutional requirements, as the same is neither in
			<lb />
			breach of the rule of &quot;separation of powers&quot;, nor that of &quot;the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary&quot;. It was contended, that the impugned
			<lb />
			provisions preserve the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			75. It was submitted, that the assailed provisions had only introduced
			<lb />
			rightful checks and balances, which are inherent components of an
			<lb />
			effective constitutional arrangement. The learned Attorney General also
			<lb />
			cautioned this Court, by asserting, that it was neither within the domain
			<lb />
			of the petitioners, nor of this Court, to suggest an alternative
			<lb />
			combination of Members for the NJAC, or an alternative procedure,
			<lb />
			which would regulate its functioning more effectively. Insofar as the
			<lb />
			present petitions are concerned, it was asserted, that the challenge raised
			<lb />
			therein, could only be accepted, if it was shown, that the Parliament
			<lb />
			while exercising its plenary power to amend the Constitution, had
			<lb />
			violated the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			76. It was submitted, that it was not the case of any of the petitioners
			<lb />
			before this Court, either that the Parliament was not competent to amend
			<lb />
			Article 124, or that the procedure prescribed therefor under Article 368
			<lb />
			had not been followed. In the above view of the matter, it was submitted,
			<lb />
			that the only scope for examination with reference to the present
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment was, whether while making the aforestated
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment, the Parliament had breached, any of the
			<lb />
			&quot;basic features&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			77(i). For demonstrating the validity of the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment, reliance in the first instance was placed on the
			<lb />
			Kesavananda Bharati case 10 . Reference was made to the observations of
			<lb />
			S.M. Sikri, CJ., to contend, that the extent of the amending power under
			<lb />
			Article 368 was duly adverted to. Reading the preamble to the
			<lb />
			Constitution, it was pointed out, that the fundamental importance
			<lb />
			expressed therein was, the freedom of the individual, and the
			<lb />
			inalienability of economic, social and political justice, as also, the
			<lb />
			importance of the Directive Principles (paragraph 282). In this behalf, it
			<lb />
			was also submitted, that the &quot;fundamental features&quot; of the Constitution,
			<lb />
			as for instance, secularism, democracy and the freedom of the individual
			<lb />
			would always subsist in a welfare State (paragraph 283). Leading to the
			<lb />
			conclusion, that even fundamental rights could be amended in public
			<lb />
			interest, subject to the overriding condition, that the same could not be
			<lb />
			completely abrogated (paragraph 287). In this behalf, it was also pointed
			<lb />
			out, that the wisdom of the Parliament to amend the Constitution could
			<lb />
			not be the subject matter of judicial review (paragraph 288), leading to
			<lb />
			the overall conclusion, that by the process of amendment, it was open to
			<lb />
			the Parliament to adjust fundamental rights, in order to secure the
			<lb />
			accomplishment of the Directive Principles, while maintaining the
			<lb />
			freedom and dignity of every citizen (paragraph 289). Thus viewed, it was
			<lb />
			felt, that the rightful legal exposition would be, that even though every
			<lb />
			provision of the Constitution could be amended, the contemplated
			<lb />
			amendment should ensure, that the &quot;basic foundation and structure&quot; of
			<lb />
			the Constitution remained intact. In this behalf, an illustrative reference
			<lb />
			was made to the features, which constituted the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. According to the learned Attorney General, they included,
			<lb />
			the supremacy of the Constitution, the republican and democratic form
			<lb />
			of Government, the secular character of the Constitution, the &quot;separation
			<lb />
			of powers&quot; between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, and
			<lb />
			the federal character of the Constitution (paragraph 292). In addition to
			<lb />
			the above, it was asserted, that India having signed the Universal
			<lb />
			Declaration of Human Rights, had committed itself to retaining such of
			<lb />
			the fundamental rights, as were incorporated in the above declaration
			<lb />
			(paragraph 299). In the above view, according to the Attorney General,
			<lb />
			the expression &quot;amendment of this Constitution&quot; would restrain the
			<lb />
			Parliament, from abrogating the fundamental rights absolutely, or from
			<lb />
			completely changing the &quot;fundamental features&quot; of the Constitution, so
			<lb />
			as to destroy its identity. And that, within the above limitation, the
			<lb />
			Parliament could amend every Article of the Constitution (paragraph
			<lb />
			475). It was insisted, that the impugned provisions had not breached
			<lb />
			any of the above limitations.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			Reference was then made to the common opinion expressed by J.M.
			<lb />
			Shelat and A.N. Grover, JJ., (in the Kesavananda Bharati case 10 ) to
			<lb />
			assert, that one of the limitations with reference to the amendment to the
			<lb />
			Constitution was, that it could not be amended to such an extent, as
			<lb />
			would denude the Constitution of its identity (paragraph 537). It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the power to amend, could not result in the abrogation of
			<lb />
			the Constitution, or lead to the framing of a new Constitution, or to alter
			<lb />
			or change the essential elements of the constitutional structure
			<lb />
			(paragraph 539). It was pointed out, that it was not proper, to give a
			<lb />
			narrow meaning to the power vested in the Parliament to amend the
			<lb />
			Constitution, and at the same time, to give it such a wide meaning, so as
			<lb />
			to enable the amending body, to change the structure and identity of the
			<lb />
			Constitution (paragraph 546). With reference to the power of judicial
			<lb />
			review, it was contended, that there was ample evidence in the
			<lb />
			Constitution itself, to indicate that a system of &quot;checks and balances&quot;
			<lb />
			was provided for, so that none of the pillars of governance would become
			<lb />
			so predominant, as to disable the others, from exercising and discharging
			<lb />
			the functions entrusted to them. It was submitted, that judicial review,
			<lb />
			provided expressly through Articles 32 and 226, was an incident of the
			<lb />
			aforestated system of checks and balances (paragraph 577). Based on
			<lb />
			the historical background, the preamble, the entire scheme of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, and other relevant provisions thereof, including Article 368,
			<lb />
			it was submitted that it could be inferred, that the supremacy of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, the republican and democratic form of Government,
			<lb />
			sovereignty of the country, the secular and federal character of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, the demarcation of powers between the legislature, the
			<lb />
			executive and the judiciary, the dignity of the individual secured through
			<lb />
			the fundamental rights, and the mandate to build a welfare State
			<lb />
			(contained in Parts III and IV), and the unity and the integrity of the
			<lb />
			nation, could be regarded as the &quot;basic elements&quot; of the constitutional
			<lb />
			structure (paragraph 582). It was also asserted, that as a society grows,
			<lb />
			its requirements change, and accordingly, the Constitution and the laws
			<lb />
			have to be changed, to suit the emerging needs. And accordingly, the
			<lb />
			necessity to amend the Constitution, to adapt to the changing needs,
			<lb />
			arises. Likewise, in order to implement the Directive Principles, it could
			<lb />
			be necessary to abridge some of the fundamental rights vested in the
			<lb />
			citizens. The power to achieve the above objective needed, a broad and
			<lb />
			liberal interpretation of Article 368. Having so held, it was concluded,
			<lb />
			that even the fundamental rights could be amended (paragraph 634).
			<lb />
			Reference was made to the fact, that the founding fathers were aware,
			<lb />
			that in a changing world, there would be nothing permanent, and
			<lb />
			therefore, they vested the power of amendment in the Parliament through
			<lb />
			Article 368, so as to keep the Constitution in tune with, the changing
			<lb />
			concepts of politics, economics and social ideas, and to so reshape the
			<lb />
			Constitution, as would meet the requirements of the time (paragraph
			<lb />
			637). With reference to the above, it was contended, that the Parliament
			<lb />
			did not have the power to abrogate or emasculate the &quot;basic elements&quot; or
			<lb />
			&quot;fundamental features&quot; of the Constitution, such as the sovereignty of
			<lb />
			India, the democratic character of our polity, the unity of the country,
			<lb />
			and the essential elements of the individual freedoms secured to the
			<lb />
			citizens. Despite the above limitations, it was pointed out, that the
			<lb />
			amending power under Article 368 was wide enough, to amend every
			<lb />
			Article of the Constitution, so as to reshape the Constitution to fulfill the
			<lb />
			obligations imposed on the State (paragraph 666). And accordingly, it
			<lb />
			was pointed out, that while recording conclusions, this Court had
			<lb />
			observed, that the power to amend the Constitution under Article 368
			<lb />
			was very wide, yet did not include the power to destroy, or emasculate
			<lb />
			the &quot;basic elements&quot; or the &quot;fundamental features&quot; of the Constitution
			<lb />
			(paragraph 744).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii). Reference was then made to the observations of H.R. Khanna, J. (in
			<lb />
			the Kesavananda Bharati case 10 ). It was pointed out, that from 1950 to
			<lb />
			1967 till this Court rendered the judgment in the I.C. Golak Nath case 41 ,
			<lb />
			the accepted position was, that the Parliament had the power to amend
			<lb />
			Part III of the Constitution, so as to take away or abridge the
			<lb />
			fundamental rights. Having noticed the fact, that no attempt was made
			<lb />
			by the Parliament to take away or abridge the fundamental rights,
			<lb />
			relating to the liberty of a person, and the freedom of expression, it was
			<lb />
			recorded, that even in future it could not be done. Accordingly, with
			<lb />
			reference to Article 368, it was sought to be concluded, that the
			<lb />
			Parliament had the power to amend Part III of the Constitution, as long
			<lb />
			as the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution was retained (paragraph
			<lb />
			1421). If the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the original Constitution was retained,
			<lb />
			inasmuch as had the original Constitution continued to subsist, even
			<lb />
			though some of its provisions were changed, the power of amendment
			<lb />
			would be considered to have been legitimately exercised (paragraph
			<lb />
			1430). And therefore, the true effect of Article 368 would be, that the
			<lb />
			Constitution did not vest with the Parliament, the power or authority for
			<lb />
			drafting a new and radically changed Constitution, with a different
			<lb />
			structure and framework (paragraph 1433). Accordingly, subject to the
			<lb />
			retention of the &quot;basic structure or framework&quot; of the Constitution, the
			<lb />
			power vested with the Parliament to amend the Constitution was treated
			<lb />
			as plenary, and would include the power to add, alter or repeal different
			<lb />
			Articles of the Constitution, including those relating to fundamental
			<lb />
			rights. All the above measures were included in the Parliament&apos;s power
			<lb />
			of amendment, and the denial of such a broad and comprehensive power,
			<lb />
			would introduce rigidity in the Constitution, as would break the
			<lb />
			Constitution itself (paragraph 1434). As such, it was held, that the
			<lb />
			amending power conferred by Article 368, would include the power to
			<lb />
			amend the fundamental rights, contained in Part III of the Constitution
			<lb />
			(paragraph 1435). In this behalf, it was asserted, that the issue, whether
			<lb />
			the amendment introduced would (or would not) be an improvement over
			<lb />
			the prevailing position, was not justiciable. It was asserted, whether the
			<lb />
			amendment would be an improvement or not, was for the Parliament
			<lb />
			alone to determine. And Courts, could not substitute the wisdom of the
			<lb />
			legislature, by their own foresight, prudence and understanding
			<lb />
			(paragraph 1436). It was asserted, that the amending power of the
			<lb />
			Parliament must contain the right to enact legislative provisions, for
			<lb />
			experiment and trial, so as to eventually achieve the best results
			<lb />
			(paragraph 1437). In the ultimate analysis, it was held, that the
			<lb />
			amendment of the Constitution had a wide and broad connotation, and
			<lb />
			would embrace within itself, the total repeal of some of the Articles, or
			<lb />
			their substitution by new Articles, which may not be consistent, or in
			<lb />
			conformity with other Articles. And a Court while judging the validity of
			<lb />
			an amendment, could only concern itself with the question, as to whether
			<lb />
			the constitutional requirements for making the amendment had been
			<lb />
			satisfied? And accordingly, an amendment, made in consonance with the
			<lb />
			procedure prescribed, could not be struck down, on the ground that it
			<lb />
			was a change for the worst (paragraph 1442). While examining the
			<lb />
			question, whether the right to property could be included in the &quot;basic
			<lb />
			structure or framework&quot; of the Constitution, the answer rendered was in
			<lb />
			the negative. It was held, that in exercising the power of judicial review,
			<lb />
			Courts could not be oblivious of the practical needs of the Government.
			<lb />
			And that, the power of amendment could be exercised even for trial and
			<lb />
			error, inasmuch as opportunity had to be allowed for vindicating
			<lb />
			reasonable belief by experience (paragraph 1535). It was contended, that
			<lb />
			no generation had a monopoly to wisdom, nor the right to place fetters on
			<lb />
			future generations, nor to mould the machinery of Government, keeping
			<lb />
			in mind eternal good. The possibility, that the power of amendment may
			<lb />
			be abused, furnished no ground for denial of its existence. According to
			<lb />
			the Attorney General, it was therefore not correct to assume, that if the
			<lb />
			Parliament was held entitled to amend Part III of the Constitution, it
			<lb />
			would automatically and necessarily result in abrogation of the
			<lb />
			fundamental rights. Whilst concluding, that the right to property did not
			<lb />
			pertain to the &quot;basic structure or framework&quot; of the Constitution, it was
			<lb />
			held, that power of amendment under Article 368 did not include the
			<lb />
			power to abrogate the Constitution, or to alter the &quot;basic structure or
			<lb />
			framework&quot; of the Constitution. Despite having so concluded, it was held,
			<lb />
			that no part of the fundamental rights could claim immunity, from the
			<lb />
			power of amendment (paragraph 1537).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			78. Reference was then made to the judgments rendered by this Court
			<lb />
			in Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain 56 , Waman Rao v. Union of India 57 ,
			<lb />
			and the M. Nagaraj case 36 , to contend, that the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution was to be determined, on the basis of the features which
			<lb />
			existed in the text of the original enactment of the Constitution, on the
			<lb />
			date of its coming into force. It was therefore pointed out, that the
			<lb />
			subsequent amendments to the Constitution, could not be taken into
			<lb />
			consideration, to determine the &quot;basic features&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			79. Having laid down the aforestated foundation, the learned Attorney
			<lb />
			General submitted, that that reference could only be made to Articles 124
			<lb />
			and 217, as they originally existed, when the Constitution was
			<lb />
			promulgated. If the original provisions were to be taken into
			<lb />
			consideration, according to the learned Attorney General, it would be
			<lb />
			apparent that the above Articles, expressed that the right to make
			<lb />
			appointments of Judges to the higher judiciary, being limited only to a
			<lb />
			&quot;consultative&quot; participation of the judiciary, was in the determinative
			<lb />
			domain of the executive. It was pointed out, that on the subject of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, the primacy of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, through the collegium process, was an innovation of the
			<lb />
			judiciary itself (in the Second Judges case). The above primacy, was
			<lb />
			alien to the provisions of the Constitution, as originally enacted. And as
			<lb />
			such, the amendment to Article 124, and the insertion of Articles 124A to
			<lb />
			124C therein, could not be examined on the touchstone of material,
			<lb />
			which was in stark contrast with the plain reading of Articles 124 and
			<lb />
			217 (as they were originally enacted). It was accordingly asserted, that
			<lb />
			the present challenge to the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, would
			<lb />
			not fall within the defined parameters of the &quot;basic structure&quot; concept,
			<lb />
			elaborated extensively by him (as has been recorded by us, above). The
			<lb />
			prayers made by the petitioners on the instant ground were therefore,
			<lb />
			according to the learned Attorney General, liable to be rejected.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			80. Having traveled thus far, it was pointed out, that it was important
			<lb />
			to understand the true purport and effect of the term &quot;independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary&quot;. In this behalf, in the first instance, the Court&apos;s attention
			<lb />
			was invited to, the First Judges case, wherein reference was made to the
			<lb />
			opinion expressed by E.S. Venkataramiah, J. (as he then was), who had
			<lb />
			taken the view, that it was difficult to hold, that merely because the
			<lb />
			power of appointment was with the executive, the &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot; would be compromised. In stating so, it was emphasized, that
			<lb />
			the true principle was, that after such appointment, the executive should
			<lb />
			have no scope, to interfere with the work of a Judge (paragraph 1033).
			<lb />
			Based thereon, it was asserted, that the independence of a Judge would
			<lb />
			not stand compromised, if after his appointment, the role of the
			<lb />
			executive, to deal with him, is totally excluded. Reference was then made
			<lb />
			to the opinion expressed by P.N. Bhagwati, J. (as he then was) (in the
			<lb />
			same judgment), to the effect, that the concept of &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot;, was not limited only to independence from executive
			<lb />
			pressure/influence, but was relatable to many other pressures and
			<lb />
			prejudices. And in so recording, it was held, that &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot; included fearlessness of the other power centres, economic or
			<lb />
			political, and freedom from prejudices acquired and nourished by the
			<lb />
			class to which the Judges belonged (paragraph 1037). Based thereon, it
			<lb />
			was asserted, that &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, included
			<lb />
			independence from the influence of other Judges as well. And as such, it
			<lb />
			was concluded, that the composition of the NJAC was such, as would
			<lb />
			ensure the independence of the Judges appointed to the higher judiciary,
			<lb />
			as contemplated in the First Judges case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			81. In conjunction with the issue of &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;,
			<lb />
			which flows out of the concept of &quot;separation of powers&quot;, it was pointed
			<lb />
			out, that the scheme of the Constitution envisaged a system of checks
			<lb />
			and balances. Inasmuch as, each organ of governance while being
			<lb />
			allowed the freedom to discharge the duties assigned to it, was subjected
			<lb />
			to controls, at the hands of one of the other organs, or both of the other
			<lb />
			organs. Illustratively, it was sought to be contended, that all executive
			<lb />
			authority, is subject to scrutiny through judicial review (at the hands of
			<lb />
			the judiciary). Likewise, legislation enacted by the Parliament, or the
			<lb />
			State legislatures, is also subject to judicial review, (at the hands of the
			<lb />
			judiciary). Even though, the executive and the legislature have the
			<lb />
			freedom to function and discharge their individual responsibilities,
			<lb />
			without interference by the other organ(s) of governance, yet the judiciary
			<lb />
			has been vested with the responsibility to ensure, that the exercise of
			<lb />
			executive and legislative functions, is in consonance with law. Likewise,
			<lb />
			it was submitted, that in the matter of appointment of Judges, Articles
			<lb />
			124 and 217 provided for executive control, under the scheme of checks
			<lb />
			and balances. It was submitted, that the instant scheme of checks and
			<lb />
			balances, was done away with, by the Second and Third Judges cases, in
			<lb />
			the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary. It was
			<lb />
			asserted, that the position of checks and balances has been restored by
			<lb />
			the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, by reducing the role of the
			<lb />
			executive, from the position which existed at the commencement of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. Referring to the decisions in the Kesavananada Bharati
			<lb />
			case 10 , the Indira Nehru Gandhi case 56 , the Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth
			<lb />
			case 5 , Asif Hameed v. State of Jammu and Kashmir 58 , State of Bihar v.
			<lb />
			Bihar Distillery Limited 59 , and Bhim Singh v. Union of India 13 , it was
			<lb />
			submitted, that this Court had recognized, that the concept of checks
			<lb />
			and balances, was inherent in the scheme of the Constitution. And that,
			<lb />
			even though the legislature, the executive and the judiciary were required
			<lb />
			to function within their own spheres demarcated through different
			<lb />
			Articles of the Constitution, yet their attributes could never be in
			<lb />
			absolute terms. It was submitted, that each wing of governance had to be
			<lb />
			accountable, and till the principle of accountability was preserved, the
			<lb />
			principle of &quot;separation of powers&quot; would not be achievable. It was
			<lb />
			therefore contended, that the concept of &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;,
			<lb />
			could not be gauged as an absolute end, overlooking the checks and
			<lb />
			balances, provided for in the scheme of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			82. Having so asserted, it was contended, that in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, the most important and
			<lb />
			significant feature was, that no unworthy or doubtful appointment
			<lb />
			should go through, even though at times, the candidature of a seemingly
			<lb />
			good candidate, may not be accepted. It was asserted, that the NJAC
			<lb />
			had provided for a complete protection, in the sense noticed hereinabove,
			<lb />
			by providing in the procedure of appointment, that a negative view
			<lb />
			expressed by any of the two Members of the NJAC, would result in the
			<lb />
			rejection of the concerned candidate. Therefore, merely two Members of
			<lb />
			the NJAC, would be sufficient to veto a proposal for appointment. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that since three Members of the NJAC were Judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court, their participation in the NJAC would ensure, that
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; remained completely safeguarded and
			<lb />
			secured. It was therefore contended, that not only the Constitution (99th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, but also the NJAC Act fully satisfied the independence
			<lb />
			criterion, postulated as a &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			83. In order to reiterate the above position, it was asserted, that
			<lb />
			primacy in the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary,
			<lb />
			was not contemplated in the Constitution, as originally framed. In this
			<lb />
			behalf, reference was made to Articles 124 and 217. And in conjunction
			<lb />
			therewith, adverting to the debates on the subject, by Members of the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly. Thereupon, it was asserted, that the issue of
			<lb />
			primacy of the Chief Justice, based on a decision by a collegium of
			<lb />
			Judges, was a judicial innovation, which required reconsideration.
			<lb />
			Moreover, it was submitted, that the Second and Third Judges cases,
			<lb />
			were founded on the interpretation of Articles of the Constitution, which
			<lb />
			had since been amended, and as such, the very basis of the Second and
			<lb />
			Third Judges cases, no longer existed. Therefore, the legal position
			<lb />
			declared in the above judgments, could not constitute the basis, of the
			<lb />
			contentions advanced at the hands of the petitioners. Furthermore, even
			<lb />
			if the ratio recorded by this Court in the Second and Third Judges cases,
			<lb />
			was still to be taken into consideration, conclusions (5), (6) and (7)
			<lb />
			recorded by J.S. Verma, J. (who had transcripted the majority view),
			<lb />
			show that the primacy of the judiciary was to ensure, that no
			<lb />
			appointment could be made to the higher judiciary, unless it had the
			<lb />
			approval of the collegium. It was submitted, that the instant aspect,
			<lb />
			which constituted the functional basis for ensuring &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot;, had been preserved in the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment, and the NJAC Act. It was accordingly contended, that if the
			<lb />
			right to insist on the appointment of a candidate proposed by the
			<lb />
			judiciary, was taken away, from the Chief Justice of India (based on a
			<lb />
			decision of a collegium of Judges), the same would not result, in the
			<lb />
			emasculation of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution. In other words,
			<lb />
			the same would not violate the &quot;essential and fundamental features&quot; of
			<lb />
			the Constitution, nor in the least, the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			84. Based on the above submissions, the learned Attorney General
			<lb />
			invited the Court&apos;s attention to the primary contention advanced by the
			<lb />
			petitioners, namely, that even if all the three Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court who are now ex officio Members of the NJAC, collectively
			<lb />
			recommended a nominee, such recommendation could be annulled, by
			<lb />
			the non-Judge Members of the NJAC. Learned Attorney General
			<lb />
			submitted, that the above contention was limited to the right to &quot;insist&quot;
			<lb />
			on an appointment. And that, the right to &quot;insist&quot; did not flow from the
			<lb />
			conclusions recorded in the Second and Third Judges cases. And further,
			<lb />
			that the same cannot, by itself, be taken as an incident to establish a
			<lb />
			breach of the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			85. Insofar as the Second and Third Judges cases are concerned, it was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the same may have been the need of the hour, on
			<lb />
			account of the fact that in 1976, sixteen Judges were transferred (from
			<lb />
			the High Courts in which they were functioning), to other High Courts.
			<lb />
			In the Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth case 5 , one of the transferred Judges
			<lb />
			challenged his transfer, inter alia, on the ground, that his
			<lb />
			non-consensual transfer was outside the purview of Article 222, as the
			<lb />
			same would adversely affect the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;.
			<lb />
			Irrespective of the determination rendered, on the challenge raised in the
			<lb />
			Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth case 5 , it was pointed out, the very same
			<lb />
			question came to be re-agitated in the First Judges case. It was held by
			<lb />
			the majority, while interpreting Article 222, that the consent of the Judge
			<lb />
			being transferred, need not be obtained. It was also pointed out, that
			<lb />
			ever since the inception of the Constitution, the office of the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India, was occupied by the senior most Judge of the Supreme Court.
			<lb />
			The above principle was departed from in April 1973, as the next senior
			<lb />
			most Judge -J.M. Shelat, was not elevated to the office of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India. Even the next two senior most Judges, after him -K.S.
			<lb />
			Hegde and A.N. Grover, were also ignored. The instant supersession by
			<lb />
			appointing the fourth senior most Judge -A.N. Ray, as the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India, was seen as a threat to the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;.
			<lb />
			Again in January 1977, on the retirement of A.N. Ray, CJ., the senior
			<lb />
			most Judge immediately next to him -H.R. Khanna, was ignored and the
			<lb />
			second senior most Judge -M.H. Beg, was appointed, as the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India. In the above background, the action of the executive,
			<lb />
			came to be portrayed as a subversion of the &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot;. It was in the above background, that this Court rendered the
			<lb />
			Second and Third Judges cases, but the implementation of the manner of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, in consonance therewith,
			<lb />
			had been subject to, overwhelming and all around criticism, including
			<lb />
			being adversely commented upon by J.S. Verma, CJ., the author of the
			<lb />
			majority view in the Second Judges case, after his retirement. In this
			<lb />
			behalf, the Court&apos;s attention was invited to his observations, extracted
			<lb />
			hereunder:
			<lb />
			&quot;My 1993 Judgment, which holds the field, was very much
			<lb />
			misunderstood and misused. It was in this context, that I said that the
			<lb />
			working of the judgment, now, for some time, is raising serious
			<lb />
			questions, which cannot be called unreasonable. Therefore, some kind of
			<lb />
			re-think is required. My Judgment says the appointment process of High
			<lb />
			Court and Supreme Court Judges is basically a joint or participatory
			<lb />
			exercise, between the Executive and the Judiciary, both taking part in it.&quot;
			<lb />
			It was therefore contended, that in the changed scenario, this Court
			<lb />
			ought to have, at its own, introduced measures to negate the accusations
			<lb />
			leveled against the prevailing system, of appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary. Since no such remedial measures were adopted by the
			<lb />
			judiciary of its own, the legislature had brought about the Constitution
			<lb />
			(99th Amendment) Act, supplemented by the NJAC Act, to broad base the
			<lb />
			process of selection and appointment, of Judges to the higher judiciary,
			<lb />
			to make it transparent, and to render the participants accountable.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			86. Having dealt with the constitutional aspect of the matter, the
			<lb />
			learned Attorney General invited the Court&apos;s attention, to the manner in
			<lb />
			which judicial appointments were being made in fifteen countries. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that in nine countries Judges were appointed either through a
			<lb />
			Judicial Appointment Commission (Kenya, Pakistan, South Africa and
			<lb />
			U.K.), or Committee (Israel), or Councils (France, Italy, Nigeria and Sri
			<lb />
			Lanka). In four countries, Judges were appointed directly by the
			<lb />
			Governor General (Australia, Canada and New Zealand), or the President
			<lb />
			(Bangladesh). It was submitted, that in Germany appointment of Judges
			<lb />
			was made through a multistage process of nomination by the Minister of
			<lb />
			Justice, and confirmation by Parliamentary Committees, whereupon, the
			<lb />
			final order of appointment of the concerned individual, is issued by the
			<lb />
			President. In the United States of America, Judges were appointed
			<lb />
			through a process of nomination by the President, and confirmation by
			<lb />
			the Senate. It was submitted, that in all the fifteen countries referred to
			<lb />
			above, the executive was the final determinative/appointing authority.
			<lb />
			Insofar as the appointments made by the Judicial Appointments
			<lb />
			Commissions/Committees/Councils (referred to above) were concerned,
			<lb />
			out of nine countries with Commissions, in two countries (South Africa
			<lb />
			and Sri Lanka) the executive had overwhelming majority, in four
			<lb />
			countries (France, Israel, Kenya and U.K.) there was a balanced
			<lb />
			representation of stakeholders including the executive, in three countries
			<lb />
			(Italy, Nigeria and Pakistan) the number of Judges was in a majority. In
			<lb />
			the five countries without Commissions/ Committees/ Councils (Canada,
			<lb />
			Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh and the United States of America),
			<lb />
			the decision was taken by the executive, without any formal process of
			<lb />
			consultation with the judiciary. It was pointed out, that in Germany, the
			<lb />
			appointment process was conducted by the Parliament, and later
			<lb />
			confirmed by the President. It was pointed out, that the judiciary in all
			<lb />
			the countries referred to above, was totally independent. Based on the
			<lb />
			above submissions, it was contended, that the manner of selection and
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges, could not be linked to the concept of
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. It was submitted, that the judicial
			<lb />
			functioning in the countries referred to above, having been accepted as
			<lb />
			more than satisfactory, there is no reason, that the system of
			<lb />
			appointment introduced in India, would be adversely impacted by a
			<lb />
			singular representative of the executive in the NJAC. It was therefore
			<lb />
			asserted, that the submissions advanced at the hands of the petitioners,
			<lb />
			were not acceptable, even with reference to the experience of other
			<lb />
			countries, governed through a constitutional framework (some of them, of
			<lb />
			the Westminster Model).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			87. It was further asserted, that the absence of the absolute majority of
			<lb />
			Judges in the NJAC, could not lead to the inference, that the same was
			<lb />
			violative of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution, so as to conclude,
			<lb />
			that it would impinge upon the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. It was
			<lb />
			asserted, that the representation of the judiciary in the NJAC, was larger
			<lb />
			than that of the other two organs of the governance, namely, the
			<lb />
			executive and the legislature. In any case, given the representation of the
			<lb />
			judiciary in the NJAC, it was fully competent, to stall the appointment of
			<lb />
			a candidate to the higher judiciary, who was considered by the judicial
			<lb />
			representatives, as unsuitable. Any two, of the three representatives of
			<lb />
			the judiciary, were sufficient to veto any appointment supported by
			<lb />
			others.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			88. It was further submitted, that the NJAC was broad based with
			<lb />
			representatives from the judiciary, the executive and the &quot;two eminent
			<lb />
			persons&quot;, would not fall in the category of jurists, eminent legal
			<lb />
			academicians, or eminent lawyers. It was contended, that the intention
			<lb />
			to include &quot;eminent persons&quot;, who had no legal background was to
			<lb />
			introduce, in the process of selection and appointment of Judges, lay
			<lb />
			persons in the same manner, as has been provided for in the Judicial
			<lb />
			Appointments Commission, in the United Kingdom.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			89. It was also the contention of the learned Attorney General, that this
			<lb />
			would not be the first occasion, when such an exercise has been
			<lb />
			contemplated by parliamentary legislation. The Court&apos;s attention was
			<lb />
			drawn to the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, wherein the highest
			<lb />
			adjudicatory authority is, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
			<lb />
			Commission. It was pointed out, that the above Redressal Commission,
			<lb />
			comprised of Members, with and without a judicial background. The
			<lb />
			President of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has
			<lb />
			to be a person, who has been a Judge of the Supreme Court.
			<lb />
			Illustratively, it was contended, where a matter is being adjudicated upon
			<lb />
			by a three-Member Bench, two of the Members may not be having any
			<lb />
			judicial background. These two non-judicial Members, could overrule the
			<lb />
			view expressed by a person, who had been a former Judge in the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary. It was submitted, that situations of the above nature, do
			<lb />
			sometimes take place. Yet, such a composition for adjudicatory
			<lb />
			functioning, where the Members with a judicial background are in a
			<lb />
			minority, is legally and constitutionally valid. If judicial independence
			<lb />
			cannot be held to be compromised in the above situation, it was asserted,
			<lb />
			that it was difficult to understand how the same could be considered to
			<lb />
			be compromised in a situation, wherein the NJAC has three out of its six
			<lb />
			Members, belonging to the judicial fraternity.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			90. It was sought to be suggested, that the primacy of the judiciary, in
			<lb />
			the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, could not be
			<lb />
			treated as a part of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			Furthermore, the lack of absolute majority of Judges in the NJAC, would
			<lb />
			also not tantamount to the constitutional amendment being rendered
			<lb />
			violative of the &quot;basic structure&quot;. In the above view of the matter, it was
			<lb />
			asserted, that the submissions advanced at the hands of the learned
			<lb />
			counsel representing the petitioners, on the aspect of violation of the
			<lb />
			&quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution, by undermining the &quot;independence
			<lb />
			of the judiciary&quot;, were liable to be rejected.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			91. With reference to the inclusion of two &quot;eminent persons&quot;, in the
			<lb />
			six-Member NJAC, it was submitted, that the general public was the key
			<lb />
			stakeholder, in the adjudicatory process. And accordingly, it was
			<lb />
			imperative to ensure their participation in the selection/appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges to the higher judiciary. Their participation, it was submitted,
			<lb />
			would ensure sufficient diversity, essential for rightful decision making.
			<lb />
			It was submitted, that in the model of the commission suggested by M.N.
			<lb />
			Venkatachaliah, CJ., the participation of one eminent person was
			<lb />
			provided. He was to be nominated by the President, in consultation with
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India. In the 2003 Bill, which was placed before the
			<lb />
			Parliament, the proposed Judicial Commission was to include one
			<lb />
			eminent person, to be nominated by the executive. The 2013 Bill, which
			<lb />
			was drafted by the previous political dispensation -the U.P.A.
			<lb />
			Government, the Judicial Commission proposed, was to have two
			<lb />
			eminent persons, to be selected by the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India and the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. The 2014
			<lb />
			Bill, which was drafted by the present political dispensation -the N.D.A.
			<lb />
			Government, included two eminent persons, to be selected in just about
			<lb />
			the same manner as was contemplated under the 2013 Bill. The variation
			<lb />
			being, that one of the eminent persons was required to belong to the
			<lb />
			Scheduled Castes, or the Scheduled Tribes, or Other Backward Classes,
			<lb />
			or Minorities, or Women, thereby fulfilling the obvious social obligation.
			<lb />
			It was submitted, that their participation in the deliberations, for
			<lb />
			selection of Judges to the higher judiciary, could not be described as
			<lb />
			adversarial to the judicial community. Their participation would make
			<lb />
			the process of appointment, more broad based.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			92. While responding to the submissions, advanced at the hands of the
			<lb />
			learned counsel for the petitioners, to the effect that the Constitution
			<lb />
			(99th Amendment) Act, did not provide any guidelines, reflecting upon
			<lb />
			the eligibility of the &quot;eminent persons&quot;, to be nominated to the NJAC, and
			<lb />
			as such, was liable to be struck down, it was submitted, that the term
			<lb />
			&quot;eminent person&quot; was in no way vague. It meant -a person who had
			<lb />
			achieved distinction in the field of his expertise. Reference was also made
			<lb />
			to the debates of the Constituent Assembly, while dealing with the term
			<lb />
			&quot;distinguished jurist&quot;, contained in Article 124(3), it was pointed out, that
			<lb />
			the term &quot;distinguished person&quot; was not vague. In the present situation,
			<lb />
			it was submitted, that since the selection and nomination of &quot;eminent
			<lb />
			persons&quot;, was to be in the hands of high constitutional functionaries (no
			<lb />
			less than the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of India and the Leader of
			<lb />
			the Opposition in the Lok Sabha), it was natural to assume, that the
			<lb />
			person(s) nominated, would be chosen, keeping in mind the obligation
			<lb />
			and the responsibility, that was required to be discharged. Reliance in
			<lb />
			this behalf, was placed on the Centre for Public Interest Litigation case 43 ,
			<lb />
			to assert, that it was sufficient to assume, that such a high profile
			<lb />
			committee, as the one in question, would exercise its powers objectively,
			<lb />
			and in a fair and reasonable manner. Based on the above, it was
			<lb />
			contended, that it was well settled, that mere conferment of wide
			<lb />
			discretionary powers, would not vitiate the provision itself.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			93. Referring to the required qualities of a Judge recognized in the
			<lb />
			Indian context, as were enumerated in the &quot;Bangalore Principles of
			<lb />
			Judicial Conduct&quot;, and thereupon accepted the world over, as revised at
			<lb />
			the Round Table Meeting of Chief Justices held at The Hague, in
			<lb />
			November 2002, it was submitted, that the two &quot;eminent persons&quot; would
			<lb />
			be most suited, to assess such matters, with reference to the nominees
			<lb />
			under consideration. Whilst the primary responsibility of the Members
			<lb />
			from the judiciary would be principally relatable to, ascertaining the
			<lb />
			judicial acumen of the candidates concerned, the responsibility of the
			<lb />
			executive would be, to determine the character and integrity of the
			<lb />
			candidate, and the inputs, whether the candidate possessed the values,
			<lb />
			expected of a Judge of the higher judiciary, would be that of &quot;eminent
			<lb />
			persons&quot; in the NJAC. It was therefore asserted, that the two &quot;eminent
			<lb />
			persons&quot; would be &quot;lay persons&quot; having no connection with the judiciary,
			<lb />
			or even to the profession of advocacy, perhaps individuals who may not
			<lb />
			have any law related academic qualifications. It was submitted, that the
			<lb />
			instant broad based composition of the NJAC, was bound to be more
			<lb />
			suitable, than the prevailing system of appointment of Judges. Relying
			<lb />
			upon the R. Gandhi case 38 , it was submitted, that it would not be proper
			<lb />
			to make appointments, by vesting the process of selection, with an
			<lb />
			isolated group, or a selection committee dominated by representatives of
			<lb />
			a singular group -the judiciary. In a matter of judicial appointments, it
			<lb />
			was submitted, the object ought to be, to pick up the best legally trained
			<lb />
			minds, coupled with a qualitative personality. For this, according to the
			<lb />
			Attorney General, a collective consultative process, would be the most
			<lb />
			suitable. It was pointed out, that &quot;eminent persons&quot;, having no nexus to
			<lb />
			judicial activities, would introduce an element of detachment, and would
			<lb />
			help to bring in independent expertise, to evaluate non-legal
			<lb />
			competencies, from an ordinary citizen&apos;s perspective, and thereby,
			<lb />
			represent all the stakeholders of the justice delivery system. It was
			<lb />
			contended, that the presence of &quot;eminent persons&quot; was necessary, to
			<lb />
			ensure the representative participation of the general public, in the
			<lb />
			selection and appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary. Their
			<lb />
			presence would also ensure, that the selection process was broad based,
			<lb />
			and reflected sufficient diversity and accountability, and in sync with the
			<lb />
			evolving process of selection and appointment of Judges, the world over.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			94. The learned Attorney General, then addressed the issue of inclusion
			<lb />
			of the Union Minister in charge of Law and Justice, as an ex officio
			<lb />
			Member in the NJAC. Reference was first made to Articles 124 and 217,
			<lb />
			as they were originally enacted in the Constitution. It was submitted,
			<lb />
			that originally, the power of appointment of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, was exclusively vested with the President. In this behalf
			<lb />
			reliance was placed on Article 74, whereunder the President was obliged
			<lb />
			to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, headed by the
			<lb />
			Prime Minister. It was pointed out, that the above position, was so
			<lb />
			declared, by the First Judges case. And as such, from the date of
			<lb />
			commencement of the Constitution, the executive had the exclusive role,
			<lb />
			in the selection and appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary. It was
			<lb />
			asserted, that the position was changed, for the first time, in 1993 by the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case, wherein the term &quot;consultation&quot;, with reference to
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India, was interpreted as &quot;concurrence&quot;. Having been
			<lb />
			so interpreted, primacy in the matter of appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, came to be transferred from the executive, to the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India (based on a collective decision, by a collegium of Judges).
			<lb />
			Despite the above, the Union Minister in charge of Law and Justice,
			<lb />
			being a representative of the executive, continued to have a role in the
			<lb />
			selection process, though his involvement was substantially limited, as
			<lb />
			against the responsibility assigned to the executive under Articles 124
			<lb />
			and 217, as originally enacted. It was pointed out, that by including the
			<lb />
			Union Minister in charge of Law and Justice, as a Member of the NJAC,
			<lb />
			the participatory role of the executive, in the matter of selection and
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, had actually been
			<lb />
			diminished, as against the original position. Inasmuch as, the executive
			<lb />
			role in the NJAC, had been reduced to one out of the six Members of the
			<lb />
			Commission. In the above view of the matter, it was asserted, that it was
			<lb />
			unreasonable for the petitioners to grudge, the presence of the Union
			<lb />
			Minister in charge of Law and Justice, as a Member of the NJAC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			95. Insofar as the inclusion of the Union Minister in the NJAC is
			<lb />
			concerned, it was submitted, that there could be no escape from the fact,
			<lb />
			that the Minister in question, would be the connect between the judiciary
			<lb />
			and the Parliament. His functions would include, the responsibility to
			<lb />
			inform the Parliament, about the affairs of the judicial establishment. It
			<lb />
			was submitted, that his exclusion from the participatory process, would
			<lb />
			result in a lack of coordination between the two important pillars of
			<lb />
			governance. Furthermore, it was submitted that the Minister in question,
			<lb />
			as a member of the executive, will have access to, and will be able to,
			<lb />
			provide the NJAC with all the relevant information, about the
			<lb />
			antecedents of a particular candidate, which the remaining Members of
			<lb />
			the NJAC are unlikely to have access to. This, according to the learned
			<lb />
			Attorney General, would ensure, that the persons best suited to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, would be selected. Moreover, it was submitted, that the
			<lb />
			executive was a key stakeholder in the justice delivery system, and as
			<lb />
			such, it was imperative for him to have, a role in the process of selection
			<lb />
			and appointment of Judges, to the higher judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			96. The learned Attorney General allayed all fears, with reference to the
			<lb />
			presence of Union Minister, in the NJAC, by asserting that he would not
			<lb />
			be in a position to politicize the appointments, as he was just one of the
			<lb />
			six-Members of the NJAC. And that, the other Members would constitute
			<lb />
			an adequate check, even if the Minister in question, desired to favour a
			<lb />
			particular candidate, on political considerations. This submission was
			<lb />
			made by the learned Attorney General, keeping in mind the assumed
			<lb />
			fear, which the petitioners had expressed, on account of the political
			<lb />
			leanings of the Union Minister, with the governing political
			<lb />
			establishment. It was accordingly asserted, that the presence of one
			<lb />
			member of the executive, in a commission of six Members, would not
			<lb />
			impact the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, leading to the clear and
			<lb />
			unambiguous conclusion, that the presence of the Union Minister in
			<lb />
			charge of Law and Justice in the NJAC, would not violate the &quot;basic
			<lb />
			structure&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			97. Referring to the judgment rendered by this Court, in the Madras
			<lb />
			Bar Association case 35 , it was submitted that, for the tribunal in
			<lb />
			question, the participation of the executive in the selection of its
			<lb />
			Members, had been held to be unsustainable, because the executive was
			<lb />
			a stakeholder in each matter, that was to be adjudicated by the tribunal.
			<lb />
			It was submitted, that the above position did not prevail insofar as the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary was concerned, since the stakeholders before the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary were diverse. It was, therefore, submitted, that the validity of
			<lb />
			the NJAC could not be assailed, merely on the ground of presence of the
			<lb />
			Union Minister, as an ex officio Member of the NJAC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			98. The manner of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary,
			<lb />
			through the NJAC, it was asserted, would have two major advantages. It
			<lb />
			would introduce transparency in the process of selection and
			<lb />
			appointments of Judges, which had hitherto before, been extremely
			<lb />
			secretive, with the civil society left wondering about, the standards and
			<lb />
			the criterion adopted, in determining the suitability of candidates.
			<lb />
			Secondly, the NJAC would diversify the selection process, which would
			<lb />
			further lead to accountability in the matter of appointments. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that not only the litigating public, or the practicing advocates,
			<lb />
			but also the civil society, had the right to know. It was pointed out, that
			<lb />
			insofar as the legislative process was concerned, debates in the
			<lb />
			Parliament are now in the public domain. The rights of individuals,
			<lb />
			determined at the hands of the executive, have been transparent under
			<lb />
			the Right to Information Act, 2005. It was submitted that likewise, the
			<lb />
			selection and appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, must be
			<lb />
			known to the civil society, so as to introduce not only fairness, but also a
			<lb />
			degree of assurance, that the best out of those willing, were being
			<lb />
			appointed as Judges.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			99. Referring to Article 124A(2) inserted through the Constitution (99th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, it was asserted, that a constitutional process could not
			<lb />
			be held up, due to the unavailability (and/or the disability) of one or
			<lb />
			more Members of the NJAC. So that a defect in the constitution of the
			<lb />
			NJAC, or any vacancy therein, would not impact the process of selection
			<lb />
			and appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary. Article 124A(2)
			<lb />
			provided, that the proceedings of the NJAC would not be questioned or
			<lb />
			invalidated on account of a vacancy or a defect in the composition of the
			<lb />
			NJAC. It was contended, that it was wrongful for the petitioners to frown
			<lb />
			on Article 124A(2), as there were a number of statutory enactments with
			<lb />
			similar provisions. In this behalf, the Court&apos;s attention was inter alia
			<lb />
			drawn to Section 4(
		</p>
		<note type="other">
			2
		</note>
		<item>
			), of the Central Vigilance Commission Act 2003,
			<lb />
			Section 4(2), of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act 2013, Section 7, of the
			<lb />
			National Commission for Backward Classes Act 1993, Section 29A, of the
			<lb />
			Consumer Protection Act 1986, Section 7, of the Advocates Welfare Act
			<lb />
			2001, Section 8, of the University Grants Commission Act 1956, Section
			<lb />
			9, of the Protection of Human Rights Act 1993, Section 7, of the National
			<lb />
			Commission for Minorities Act 1993, Section 8, of the National
			<lb />
			Commission for Minority Educational Institutions Act 2004, Section 24,
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights
			<lb />
			and Full Participation) Act 1995, and a host of other legislative
			<lb />
			enactments of the same nature. Relying on the judgments in Bangalore
			<lb />
			Woollen, Cotton and Silk Mills Co. Ltd. v. Corporation of the City of
			<lb />
			Bangalore 60 , Khadim Hussain v. State of U.P. 61 , B.K. Srinivasan v. State
			<lb />
			of Karnataka 62 , and People&apos;s Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India 63 ,
			<lb />
			it was asserted, that on an examination of provisions of similar nature,
			<lb />
			this Court had repeatedly held, that modern legislative enactments
			<lb />
			ensured, that the defects of procedure, which do not lead to any
			<lb />
			substantial prejudice, are statutorily placed beyond the purview of
			<lb />
			challenge. It was accordingly asserted, that invalidity on account of a
			<lb />
			technical irregularity, being excluded from judicial review, the
			<lb />
			submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners, on the constitutional
			<lb />
			validity of clause (2) of Article 124A, deserved an outright rejection.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			100. It was the contention of the learned Attorney General, that the
			<lb />
			NJAC did not suffer from the vice of excessive delegation. It was sought
			<lb />
			to be reiterated, that the power of nomination of &quot;eminent persons&quot; was
			<lb />
			securely and rightfully left to the wisdom of the Prime Minister of India,
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India and the Leader of the Opposition in the
			<lb />
			Parliament. It was submitted, that the parameters expressed in Sections
			<lb />
			5 and 6 of the NJAC Act, delineating the criterion for selection, by
			<lb />
			specifically providing, that ability, merit and suitability would expressly
			<lb />
			engage the attention of the NJAC, while selecting Judges for appointment
			<lb />
			to the higher judiciary, clearly laid out the parameters for this selection
			<lb />
			and appointment process. It was submitted, that the modalities to
			<lb />
			determine ability, merit and suitability would be further detailed through
			<lb />
			rules and regulations. And that, factors such as, the minimum number
			<lb />
			of years of practice at the Bar, the number and nature of cases argued,
			<lb />
			academic publications in reputed journals, the minimum and maximum
			<lb />
			age, and the like, would be similarly provided for. All these clearly defined
			<lb />
			parameters, it was contended, would make the process of selection and
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary transparent, and would
			<lb />
			also ensure, that the candidates to be considered, were possessed of the
			<lb />
			minimum desired standards. It was submitted, that the Memorandum of
			<lb />
			Procedure for Appointment and Transfer of Chief Justices and Judges of
			<lb />
			the High Courts, as also, for elevation of Judges to the Supreme Court,
			<lb />
			were bereft of any such particulars, and the absence of any prescribed
			<lb />
			criterion, had resulted in the appointment of Judges, even to the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court, which should have ordinarily been avoided. The learned
			<lb />
			Attorney General made a reference to three instances, which according to
			<lb />
			him, were universally condemned, by one and all. One of the Judges
			<lb />
			appointed to this Court, according to him, was a non-performer as he
			<lb />
			had authored just a few judgments as a Judge of the High Courts of
			<lb />
			Delhi and Kerala, and far lesser judgments as the Chief Justice of the
			<lb />
			Uttarakhand and Karnataka High Courts, and less than ten judgments
			<lb />
			during his entire tenure as a Judge of the Supreme Court. The second
			<lb />
			Judge, according to him, was notoriously late in commencing Court
			<lb />
			proceeding, a habit which had persisted with the said Judge even as a
			<lb />
			Judge of the Patna and Rajasthan High Courts, and thereafter, as the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of the Jharkhand High Court, and also as a Judge of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court. The third Judge, according to the learned Attorney
			<lb />
			General, was notoriously described as a tweeting Judge, because of his
			<lb />
			habit of tweeting his views, after he had retired. Learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			respondents, acknowledged having understood the identity of the Judges
			<lb />
			from their above description by the learned Attorney General, and also
			<lb />
			affirmed the factual position asserted in respect of the Judges mentioned.
			<lb />
			The learned Attorney General also handed over to us a compilation (in a
			<lb />
			sealed cover) about appointments of Judges made to different High
			<lb />
			Courts, despite the executive having expressed an adverse opinion. The
			<lb />
			compilation made reference to elevation of five Judges to High Courts (-
			<lb />
			two Judges to the Jammu and Kashmir High Court, one Judge to the
			<lb />
			Punjab and Haryana High Court, one Judge to the Patna High Court, and
			<lb />
			one Judge to the Calcutta High Court) and three Judges to the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court. It may be clarified that the objection with reference to the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court Judges was not related to their suitability, but for the
			<lb />
			reason that some High Courts were unrepresented in the Supreme Court.
			<lb />
			We would therefore understand the above position as covering the period
			<lb />
			from 1993 till date. But it was not his contention, that these elevations
			<lb />
			had proved to be wrongful. We may only notice, that two of the three
			<lb />
			Supreme Court Judges referred to, were in due course elevated to the
			<lb />
			high office of Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			101. The learned Attorney General vehemently contested the assertion
			<lb />
			made by the learned counsel representing the petitioners, that the power
			<lb />
			to frame rules and regulations for the functioning of the NJAC was
			<lb />
			unguided, inasmuch as, neither the constitutional amendment nor the
			<lb />
			legislative enactment, provided for any parameters for framing the rules
			<lb />
			and regulations, pertaining to the criterion of suitability. In this behalf, it
			<lb />
			was submitted, that sufficient guidelines were ascertainable from Articles
			<lb />
			124B and 124C. Besides the aforesaid, the Court&apos;s attention was drawn
			<lb />
			to Sections 5(2), 6(1) and 6(3) of the NJAC Act, wherein the parameters of
			<lb />
			suitability for appointment of Judges had been laid down. In this behalf,
			<lb />
			it was also asserted, that Article 124, as originally enacted, had laid down
			<lb />
			only basic eligibility conditions, for appointment of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, but no suitability criteria had been expressed. It was also
			<lb />
			asserted, that the procedure and conditions for appointment of Judges,
			<lb />
			were also not prescribed. As against the above, it was pointed out, that
			<lb />
			Articles 124B and 124C and Sections 5(2), 6(1) and 6(3) of the NJAC Act,
			<lb />
			clearly laid down conditions and guidelines for determining the suitability
			<lb />
			of a candidate for appointment as a Judge. On the basis of the
			<lb />
			aforementioned analysis, it was submitted, that neither the constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment was violative of the &quot;basic structure&quot;, nor the NJAC Act, was
			<lb />
			constitutionally invalid. For the above reasons, it was asserted, that the
			<lb />
			challenge raised by the petitioners was liable to be rejected.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			102. In response to the technical submission advanced by Mr. Fali S.
			<lb />
			Nariman, namely, that since the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, was
			<lb />
			brought into force, consequent upon the notification issued by the
			<lb />
			Central Government in the Official Gazette on 13.4.2015, the
			<lb />
			consideration of the NJAC Bill and the passing of the NJAC Act, prior to
			<lb />
			the coming into force of the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, would
			<lb />
			render it null and void, the learned Attorney General invited our attention
			<lb />
			to Article 118, which authorizes, each House of Parliament, to make rules
			<lb />
			for regulating their procedure, in the matter of conducting their business.
			<lb />
			It was pointed out, that Rules of Procedure and the Conduct of Business
			<lb />
			of the Lok Sabha, had been duly enacted by the Lok Sabha. A relevant
			<lb />
			extract of the aforesaid rules was handed over to us. Rule 66 thereof, is
			<lb />
			being extracted hereunder:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;66. A Bill, which is dependent wholly or partly upon another Bill
			<lb />
			pending before the House, may be introduced in the House in
			<lb />
			anticipation of the passing of the Bill on which it is dependent:
			<lb />
			Provided that the second Bill shall be taken up for consideration
			<lb />
			and passing in the House only after the first Bill has been passed by the
			<lb />
			Houses and assented to by the President.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Referring to the proviso under Rule 66, it was acknowledged that the rule
			<lb />
			read independently, fully justified the submissions of Mr. Fali S.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Nariman. It was however pointed out, that it was open to the Parliament
			<lb />
			to seek a suspension of the above rule under Rule 388. Rule 388 is also
			<lb />
			extracted hereunder:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;388. Any member may, with the consent of the Speaker, move that any
			<lb />
			rule may be suspended in its application to a particular motion before
			<lb />
			the House and if the motion is carried the rule in question shall be
			<lb />
			suspended for the time being.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The learned Attorney General then handed over to us, the proceedings of
			<lb />
			the Lok Sabha dated 12.8.2014, inter alia, including the Constitution
			<lb />
			(121st Amendment) Bill, and the NJAC Bill. He invited our attention to
			<lb />
			the fact, that while moving the motion, the then Union Minister in charge
			<lb />
			of Law and Justice had sought, and was accorded approval, for the
			<lb />
			suspension of the proviso to Rule 66 of the Rules of Procedure and
			<lb />
			Conduct of Business of the Lok Sabha. Relevant extract of the Motion
			<lb />
			depicting the suspension of Rule 388 is being reproduced hereunder:
			<lb />
			&quot;Motion under Rule 388
			<lb />
			Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad moved the following motion:-
			<lb />
			&quot;That this House do suspend the proviso to rule 66 of the Rules of
			<lb />
			Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha in its application to the
			<lb />
			motions for taking into consideration and passing the National Judicial
			<lb />
			Appointments Commission Bill, 2014 in as much as it is dependent upon
			<lb />
			the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-First Amendment) Bill,
			<lb />
			2014.&quot;
			<lb />
			The motion was adopted.
			<lb />
			The motions for consideration of the Bills viz. (i) The Constitution
			<lb />
			(One Hundred and Twenty-First Amendment) Bill, 2014 (Insertion of new
			<lb />
			Articles 124A, 124B and 124C); and (ii) The National Judicial
			<lb />
			Appointments Commission Bill, 2014 were moved by Shri Ravi Shankar
			<lb />
			Prasad.&quot;
			<lb />
			Premised on the strength of the Rules framed under Article 118, learned
			<lb />
			Attorney General, also placed reliance on Article 122, which is being
			<lb />
			reproduced below:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;122. Courts not to inquire into proceedings of Parliament. -(1) The
			<lb />
			validity of any proceedings in Parliament shall not be called in question
			<lb />
			on the ground of any alleged irregularity of procedure.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2) No officer or member of Parliament in whom powers are vested by or
			<lb />
			under this Constitution for regulating procedure or the conduct of
			<lb />
			business, or for maintaining order, in Parliament shall be subject to the
			<lb />
			jurisdiction of any court in respect of the exercise by him of those
			<lb />
			powers.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Based on Article 122, it was submitted, that the Constitution itself
			<lb />
			contemplated, that the validity of the proceedings in the Parliament,
			<lb />
			could not be called in question, on the ground of alleged irregularity in
			<lb />
			procedure. While reiterating, that the procedure laid down by the
			<lb />
			Parliament under Article 118, had been duly complied with, it was
			<lb />
			submitted, that even if that had not been done, as long as the power of
			<lb />
			Parliament to legislate was not questioned, no challenge could be
			<lb />
			premised on the procedural defects in enacting the NJAC Act. In this
			<lb />
			behalf, reference was also made to Article 246, so as to contend, that the
			<lb />
			competence of the Parliament to enact the NJAC Act was clearly and
			<lb />
			unambiguously vested with the Parliament. In support of the above
			<lb />
			contention, reliance was placed on in re: Hindu Women&apos;s Rights to
			<lb />
			Property Act, 1937 64 , rendered by the Federal Court, wherein it had
			<lb />
			observed as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;One of the provisions included in Sch. 9 is that a bill shall not be
			<lb />
			deemed to have been passed by the Indian Legislature unless it has been
			<lb />
			agreed to by both Chambers either without amendment or with such
			<lb />
			amendments only as may be agreed to by both Chambers. It is common
			<lb />
			ground that the Hindu Women&apos;s Rights to Property Bill was agreed to
			<lb />
			without amendment by both Chambers of the Indian Legislature, and as
			<lb />
			soon as it received the Governor-General&apos;s assent, it became an Act (Sch.
			<lb />
			9, para. 68 (2)). Not until then had this or any other Court jurisdiction to
			<lb />
			determine whether it was a valid piece of legislation or not. It may
			<lb />
			sometimes become necessary for a Court to inquire into the proceedings
			<lb />
			of a Legislature, for the purpose of determining whether an Act was or
			<lb />
			was not validly passed; for example, whether it was in fact passed, as in
			<lb />
			the case of the Indian Legislature the law requires, by both Chambers of
			<lb />
			the Legislature before it received the Governor. General&apos;s assent. But it
			<lb />
			does not appear to the Court that the form, content or subject-matter of a
			<lb />
			bill at the time of its introduction into, or of its consideration by either
			<lb />
			Chamber of the Legislature is a matter with which a Court of law is
			<lb />
			concerned. The question whether either Chamber has the right to discuss
			<lb />
			a bill laid before it is a domestic matter regulated by the rules of the
			<lb />
			Chamber, as interpreted by its speaker, and is not a matter with which a
			<lb />
			Court can interfere, or indeed on which it is entitled to express any
			<lb />
			opinion. It is not to be supposed that a legislative body will waste its time
			<lb />
			by discussing a bill which, even if it receives the Governor-General&apos;s
			<lb />
			assent, would obviously be beyond the competence of the Legislature to
			<lb />
			enact; but if it chooses to do so, that is its own affair, and the only
			<lb />
			function of a Court is to pronounce upon the bill after it has become an
			<lb />
			Act. In the opinion of this Court, therefore, it is immaterial that the
			<lb />
			powers of the Legislature changed during the passage of the bill from the
			<lb />
			Legislative Assembly to the Council of State. The only date with which the
			<lb />
			Court is concerned is 14th April 1937, the date on which the Governor
			<lb />
			General&apos;s assent was given; and the question whether the Act was or was
			<lb />
			not within the competence of the Legislature must be determined with
			<lb />
			reference to that date and to none other.&quot;
			<lb />
			Reliance was also placed on Pandit M.S.M. Sharma v. Dr. Shree Krishna
			<lb />
			Sinha 65 , wherefrom the following observations were brought to our notice:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It now remains to consider the other subsidiary questions raised on
			<lb />
			behalf of the petitioner. It was contended that the procedure adopted
			<lb />
			inside the House of the Legislature was not regular and not strictly in
			<lb />
			accordance with law. There are two answers to this contention, firstly,
			<lb />
			that according to the previous decision of this Court, the petitioner has
			<lb />
			not the fundamental right claimed by him. He is, therefore, out of Court.
			<lb />
			Secondly, the validity of the proceedings inside the Legislature of a State
			<lb />
			cannot be called in question on the allegation that the procedure laid
			<lb />
			down by the law had not been strictly followed. Article 212 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution is a complete answer to this part of the contention raised on
			<lb />
			behalf of the petitioner. No Court can go into those questions which are
			<lb />
			within the special jurisdiction of the Legislature itself, which has the
			<lb />
			power to conduct its own business. Possibly, a third answer to this part
			<lb />
			of the contention raised on behalf of the petitioner is that it is yet
			<lb />
			premature to consider the question of procedure as the Committee is yet
			<lb />
			to conclude its proceedings. It must also be observed that once it has
			<lb />
			been held that the Legislature has the jurisdiction to control the
			<lb />
			publication of its proceedings and to go into the question whether there
			<lb />
			has been any breach of its privileges, the Legislature is vested with
			<lb />
			complete jurisdiction to carry on its proceedings in accordance with its
			<lb />
			rules of business. Even though it may not have strictly complied with the
			<lb />
			requirements of the procedural law laid down for conducting its business,
			<lb />
			that cannot be a ground for interference by this Court under Art. 32 of
			<lb />
			the Constitution. Courts have always recognised the basic difference
			<lb />
			between complete want of jurisdiction and improper or irregular exercise
			<lb />
			of jurisdiction. Mere non-compliance with rules of procedure cannot be a
			<lb />
			ground for issuing a writ under Art. 32 of the Constitution vide Janardan
			<lb />
			Reddy v. The State of Hyderabad, (1951) SCR 344.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Based on the aforesaid submissions, it was the vehement contention of
			<lb />
			the learned Attorney General, that there was no merit in the technical
			<lb />
			objections raised by the petitioners while assailing the provisions of the
			<lb />
			NJAC Act.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			103. Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned Senior Advocate, entered appearance
			<lb />
			on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh. While reiterating a few of the
			<lb />
			legal submissions canvassed by the learned Attorney General, he
			<lb />
			emphasized, that the judgments rendered by this Court, in the Second
			<lb />
			and Third Judges cases, turned the legal position, contemplated under
			<lb />
			the original Articles 124 and 217, on its head. It was submitted, that
			<lb />
			this Court has been required to entertain a public interest litigation, in
			<lb />
			an unprecedented exercise of judicial review, wherein it is sought to be
			<lb />
			asserted, that the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, had been encroached
			<lb />
			by the other two organs of governance. It was contended by learned
			<lb />
			counsel, that the instant assertion was based on a misconception, as
			<lb />
			primacy in the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary,
			<lb />
			was never vested with the judiciary. It was pointed out, that primacy in
			<lb />
			the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, was vested
			<lb />
			with the executive under Articles 124 and 217, as originally enacted.
			<lb />
			Furthermore, this Court through its judgments culminating in the First
			<lb />
			Judges case, while correctly interpreting the aforesaid provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, had rightly concluded, that the interaction between the
			<lb />
			executive and the Chief Justice of India (as well as, the other Judges of
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary) was merely &quot;consultative&quot;, and that, the executive
			<lb />
			was entirely responsible for discharging the responsibility of appointment
			<lb />
			of Judges including Chief Justices, to the higher judiciary. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the Second Judges case, by means of a judicial
			<lb />
			interpretation, vested primacy, in the matter of appointment of Judges to
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary, with the Chief Justice of India, and his collegium of
			<lb />
			Judges. It was pointed out, that after the rendering of the Second Judges
			<lb />
			case, appointments of Judges commenced to be made, in the manner
			<lb />
			expressed by the above Constitution Bench. It was asserted, that there
			<lb />
			had been, an all around severe criticism, of the process of appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges to the higher judiciary, as contemplated by the Second and Third
			<lb />
			Judges cases. It was contended, that the selection process was now
			<lb />
			limited to Judges selecting Judges, without any external participation. It
			<lb />
			was also asserted, that the exclusion of the executive from the role of
			<lb />
			selection and appointment of Judges was so extensive, that the executive
			<lb />
			has got no right to initiate any candidature, for appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges/Chief Justices to the higher judiciary. Such an interpretation of
			<lb />
			the provisions of the Constitution, it was pointed out, had not only
			<lb />
			resulted in reading the term &quot;consultation&quot; in Articles 124 and 217 as
			<lb />
			&quot;concurrence&quot;, but has gone far beyond. It was sought to be asserted,
			<lb />
			that in the impugned amendment to the Constitution, the intent
			<lb />
			contained in the original Articles 124 and 217, has been retained. The
			<lb />
			amended provisions, it was pointed out, have been tilted in favour of the
			<lb />
			judiciary, and the participatory role, earlier vested in the executive, has
			<lb />
			been severely diluted. It was submitted, that even though no element of
			<lb />
			primacy had been conferred on the judiciary by Article 124, as originally
			<lb />
			enacted, primacy has now been vested in the judiciary, inasmuch as, the
			<lb />
			NJAC has the largest number of membership from the judicial fraternity.
			<lb />
			It was highlighted, that the Union Minister in charge of Law and Justice,
			<lb />
			is the sole executive representative, in the selection process,
			<lb />
			contemplated under the amended provisions. It was therefore asserted,
			<lb />
			that it was a far cry, for anyone to advocate, that the role of the judiciary
			<lb />
			in the manner of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary having
			<lb />
			been diluted, had impinged on its independence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			104. It was contended, that the author of the majority view in the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case (J.S. Verma, J., as he then was), had himself found fault
			<lb />
			with the manner of implementation of the judgments in the Second and
			<lb />
			Third Judges cases. It was submitted that Parliament, being the voice of
			<lb />
			the people, had taken into consideration, the criticism levelled by J.S.
			<lb />
			Verma, J. (besides others), to revise the process of appointment of Judges
			<lb />
			contemplated under the Second and Third Judges cases. Having so
			<lb />
			contended, learned counsel asserted, that if this Court felt that any of the
			<lb />
			provisions, with reference to selection and appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, would not meet the standards and norms, which this
			<lb />
			Court felt sacrosanct, it was open to this Court to read down the
			<lb />
			appropriate provisions, in a manner as to round off the offending
			<lb />
			provisions, rather than quashing the impugned constitutional and
			<lb />
			legislative provisions in their entirety.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			105. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned Solicitor General of India submitted, that
			<lb />
			the entire Constitution had to be read as a whole. In this behalf, it was
			<lb />
			contended, that each provision was an integral part of the Constitution,
			<lb />
			and as such, its interpretation had to be rendered holistically. For the
			<lb />
			instant proposition, reliance was placed on the Kihoto Hollohan case 34 ,
			<lb />
			T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka 6 , R.C. Poudyal v. Union of
			<lb />
			India 66 , the M. Nagaraj case 36 , and the Kesavananda Bharati case 10 .
			<lb />
			Based on the above judgments, it was asserted, that the term &quot;President&quot;,
			<lb />
			as it existed in Articles 124 and 217, if interpreted holistically, would lead
			<lb />
			to the clear and unambiguous conclusion, that the President while
			<lb />
			discharging his responsibility with reference to appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges/Chief Justices to the higher judiciary, was bound by the aid and
			<lb />
			advice of the Council of Ministers, as contemplated under Article 74. It
			<lb />
			was contended, that the aforesaid import was rightfully examined and
			<lb />
			interpreted with reference to Article 124, in the First Judges case. But
			<lb />
			had been erroneously overlooked, in the subsequent judgments.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, it was asserted, that there could be no doubt whatsoever,
			<lb />
			while examining the impugned constitutional amendment, as also, the
			<lb />
			impugned legislative enactment, that Parliament had not breached any
			<lb />
			component of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			106. It was also contended, that in case the challenge raised to the
			<lb />
			impugned constitutional amendment, was to be accepted by this Court,
			<lb />
			and the legal position declared by this Court, was to be given effect to,
			<lb />
			the repealed provisions would not stand revived, merely because the
			<lb />
			amendment/legislation which were being assailed, were held to be
			<lb />
			unconstitutional. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is
			<lb />
			concerned, learned Solicitor General raised two independent contentions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			107. Firstly, that the issue whether a constitutional amendment once
			<lb />
			struck down, would revive the original/substituted Article, was a matter
			<lb />
			which had already been referred to a nine-Judge Constitutional Bench.
			<lb />
			In order to support the aforesaid contention, and to project the picture in
			<lb />
			its entirety, reliance was placed on, Property Owners&apos; Association v. State
			<lb />
			of Maharashtra 67 , Property Owners&apos; Association v. State of Maharashtra 68 ,
			<lb />
			and Property Owners&apos; Association v. State of Maharashtra 69 . It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the order passed by this Court, wherein the reference to
			<lb />
			a nine-Judge Constitution Bench had been made, was a case relating to
			<lb />
			the constitutionality of Article 31C. It was pointed out that Article 31C,
			<lb />
			as originally enacted provided, that &quot;…notwithstanding anything
			<lb />
			contained in Article 13, no law giving effect to the policy of the State,
			<lb />
			towards securing the principles specified in clause (b) or clause (c) of
			<lb />
			Article 39 shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it was
			<lb />
			inconsistent with, the rights conferred by Articles 14 and 19&quot;. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the latter part of Article 31C, which provided &quot;…and no
			<lb />
			law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall
			<lb />
			be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give
			<lb />
			effect to such policy…&quot; had been struck down by this Court in the
			<lb />
			Kesavananda Bharati case 10 . It was contended, that when the matter
			<lb />
			pertaining to the effect of the striking down of a constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment, had been referred to a nine-Judge Bench, it would be
			<lb />
			improper for this Court, sitting in its present composition, to determine
			<lb />
			the aforesaid issue.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			108. The second contention advanced at the hands of the learned
			<lb />
			Solicitor General, was based on Sections 6, 7 and 8 of the General
			<lb />
			Clauses Act. It was contended, that an amendment which had deleted
			<lb />
			some part of the erstwhile Article 124 of the Constitution, and
			<lb />
			substituted in its place something different, as in the case of Article 124,
			<lb />
			by the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, would not result in the
			<lb />
			revival of the original Article which was in place, prior to the
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment, even if the amendment itself was to be struck
			<lb />
			down. It was submitted, that if a substituted provision was declared as
			<lb />
			unconstitutional, for whatever ground or reason(s), the same would not
			<lb />
			automatically result in the revival of the repealed provision. In order to
			<lb />
			support the aforesaid contention, reliance was placed on Ameer-un-Nissa
			<lb />
			Begum v. Mahboob Begum 70 , Firm A.T.B. Mehtab Majid &amp; Co. v. State of
			<lb />
			Madras 71 , B.N. Tewari v. Union of India 72 , Koteswar Vittal Kamath v. K.
			<lb />
			Rangappa Baliga &amp; Co. 73 , Mulchand Odhavji v. Rajkot Borough
			<lb />
			Municipality 74 , Mohd. Shaukat Hussain Khan v. State of Andhra
			<lb />
			Pradesh 75 , State of Maharashtra v. Central Provinces Manganese Ore Co.
			<lb />
			Ltd. 76 , India Tobacco Co. Ltd. v. Commercial Tax Officer, Bhavanipore 77 ,
			<lb />
			and Kolhapur Canesugar Works Ltd. v. Union of India 78 .
			<lb />
			It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the general rule of construction was, that a repeal
			<lb />
			through a repealing enactment, would not revive anything repealed
			<lb />
			thereby. Reliance was also placed on, State of U.P. v. Hirendra Pal
			<lb />
			Singh 79 , Joint Action Committee of Air Line Pilots&apos; Association of India v.
			<lb />
			Director General of Civil Aviation 80 , and State of Tamil Nadu v. K. Shyam
			<lb />
			Sunder 81 , to contend, that the settled legal proposition was, whenever an
			<lb />
			Act was repealed, it must be considered as if it had never existed. It was
			<lb />
			pointed out, that consequent upon the instant repeal of the earlier
			<lb />
			provisions, the earlier provisions must be deemed to have been
			<lb />
			obliterated/abrogated/wiped out, wholly and completely. The instant
			<lb />
			contention was sought to be summarized by asserting, that if a
			<lb />
			substituted provision was to be struck down, the question of revival of
			<lb />
			the original provision (which had been substituted, by the struck down
			<lb />
			provision) would not arise, as the provision which had been substituted,
			<lb />
			stood abrogated, and therefore had ceased to exist in the statute itself. It
			<lb />
			was therefore submitted, that even if the challenge raised to the
			<lb />
			impugned constitutional amendment was to be accepted by this Court,
			<lb />
			the originally enacted provisions of Articles 124 and 217 would not
			<lb />
			revive.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			109. The learned Solicitor General additionally contended, that the
			<lb />
			present challenge at the hands of the petitioners should not be
			<lb />
			entertained, as it has been raised prematurely. It was submitted, that
			<lb />
			the challenge raised by the petitioners was based on assumptions and
			<lb />
			presumptions, without allowing the crystallization of the impugned
			<lb />
			amendment to the Constitution. It was asserted, that the position would
			<lb />
			crystalise only after rules and regulations were framed under the NJAC
			<lb />
			Act. It was submitted, that the question of &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot;, with reference to the amendments made, could be determined
			<lb />
			only after the NJAC Act was made operational, by laying down the
			<lb />
			manner of its functioning. Since the pendency of the present litigation
			<lb />
			had delayed the implementation of the provisions of the amendment to
			<lb />
			the Constitution, as also to the NJAC Act, it would be improper for this
			<lb />
			Court, to accede to a challenge based on conjectures and surmises.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			110. Mr. K. Parasaran, Senior Advocate, entered appearance on behalf of
			<lb />
			the State of Rajasthan. He submitted, that he would be supporting the
			<lb />
			validity of the impugned constitutional amendment, as also, the NJAC
			<lb />
			Act, and that, he endorsed all the submissions advanced on behalf of the
			<lb />
			Union of India. It was his contention, that Judges of the higher judiciary
			<lb />
			were already burdened with their judicial work, and as such, they should
			<lb />
			not be seriously worried about the task of appointment of Judges, which
			<lb />
			by the impugned amendment, had been entrusted to the NJAC. In his
			<lb />
			view, the executive and the Parliament were accountable to the people,
			<lb />
			and therefore, they should be permitted to discharge the onerous
			<lb />
			responsibility, of appointing Judges to the higher judiciary. It was
			<lb />
			asserted, that the executive and the legislature would then be
			<lb />
			answerable, to the people of this country, for the appointments they
			<lb />
			would make.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			111. On the issue of inclusion of two &quot;eminent persons&quot; in the
			<lb />
			six-Member NJAC, it was asserted, that the nomination of the &quot;eminent
			<lb />
			persons&quot; was to be made by the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, and the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. All these three
			<lb />
			individuals, being high ranking constitutional functionaries, should be
			<lb />
			trusted, to discharge the responsibility bestowed on them, in the interest
			<lb />
			of the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. It was submitted, that if
			<lb />
			constitutional functionaries, and the &quot;eminent persons&quot;, could not be
			<lb />
			trusted, then the constitutional machinery itself would fail. It was
			<lb />
			pointed out, that this Court had repeatedly described, that the
			<lb />
			Constitution was organic in character, and it had an inbuilt mechanism
			<lb />
			for evolving, with the changing times. It was asserted, that the power
			<lb />
			vested with the Parliament, under Article 368 to amend the provisions of
			<lb />
			the Constitution, was a &quot;constituent power&quot;, authorizing the Parliament
			<lb />
			to reshape the Constitution, to adapt with the changing environment. It
			<lb />
			was contended, that the above power vested in the Parliament could be
			<lb />
			exercised with the sole exception, that &quot;the basic structure/features&quot; of
			<lb />
			the Constitution, as enunciated by the Supreme Court in the
			<lb />
			Kesavananda Bharati case 10 , could not be altered/changed. According to
			<lb />
			the learned senior counsel, the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act was
			<lb />
			an exercise of the aforestated constituent power, and that, the
			<lb />
			amendment to the Constitution introduced thereby, did not in any
			<lb />
			manner, impinge upon the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			112. Referring to Article 124A, it was asserted, that the NJAC was a
			<lb />
			six-Member Commission for identifying, selecting and appointing Judges
			<lb />
			to the higher judiciary. It could under no circumstances, be found
			<lb />
			wanting, with reference to the assertions made by the petitioners. It was
			<lb />
			pointed out, that the only executive representative thereon being the
			<lb />
			Union Minister in charge of Law and Justice, it could not be inferred,
			<lb />
			that the executive would exert such influence through him, as would
			<lb />
			undermine the independence of the five other Members of the
			<lb />
			Commission. It was submitted, that the largest representation of the
			<lb />
			Commission, was that of Judges of the Supreme Court, inasmuch as, the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India, and the two senior most Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court were ex officio Members of the NJAC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			113. With reference to the two &quot;eminent persons&quot; on the NJAC, it was his
			<lb />
			contention, that they could not be identified either with the executive or
			<lb />
			the legislature. For the nomination of the two &quot;eminent persons&quot;, the
			<lb />
			Selection Committee comprises of one member of the executive, one
			<lb />
			member of the legislature, and one member of the judiciary. In the above
			<lb />
			view of the matter, it was asserted, that the contention, that the two
			<lb />
			&quot;eminent persons&quot; in the Commission would support the executive/the
			<lb />
			legislature, was preposterous. It was therefore the submission of the
			<lb />
			learned senior counsel, that the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; could not
			<lb />
			be considered to have been undermined, keeping in mind the
			<lb />
			composition of the NJAC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			114. It was also contended, that the proceedings before the NJAC would
			<lb />
			be more transparent and broad based, and accordingly, more result
			<lb />
			oriented, and would ensure, that the best candidates would be selected
			<lb />
			for appointment as Judges to the higher judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			115. It was asserted, that the NJAC provided for a consultative process
			<lb />
			with persons who were ex-hypothesi, well qualified to give proper advice
			<lb />
			in the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary. It was
			<lb />
			accordingly the assertion of learned counsel, that the determination
			<lb />
			rendered by this Court, in the Second and Third Judges cases, was not in
			<lb />
			consonance with the intent, with which Articles 124 and 217 were
			<lb />
			originally enacted. It was therefore submitted, that the subject of
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, with reference to the impugned
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment, should not be determined by relying on the
			<lb />
			Second and Third Judges cases, but only on the basis of the plain
			<lb />
			reading of Articles 124 and 217, in conjunction with, the observations
			<lb />
			expressed by the Members of the Constituent Assembly while debating on
			<lb />
			the above provisions. It was submitted, that whilst the Union Minister in
			<lb />
			charge of Law and Justice, would be in an effective position to provide
			<lb />
			necessary inputs, with reference to the character and antecedents of the
			<lb />
			candidate(s) concerned (in view of the governmental machinery available
			<lb />
			at his command), the two &quot;eminent persons&quot; would be in a position to
			<lb />
			participate in the selection process, by representing the general public,
			<lb />
			and thereby, the selection process would be infused with all around
			<lb />
			logical inputs, for a wholesome consideration.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			116. It was submitted, that since any two Members of the NJAC, were
			<lb />
			competent to veto the candidature of a nominee, three representatives of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court of India, would be clearly in a position to stall the
			<lb />
			appointment of unsuitable candidates. It was therefore contended, that
			<lb />
			the legislations enacted by the Parliament, duly ratified in terms of Article
			<lb />
			368, should be permitted to become functional, with the constitution of
			<lb />
			the NJAC, and should further be permitted to discharge the responsibility
			<lb />
			of appointing Judges to the higher judiciary. It was submitted, that in
			<lb />
			case of any deficiency in the discharge of the said responsibility, this
			<lb />
			Court could suo motu negate the selection process, or exclude one or both
			<lb />
			of the &quot;eminent persons&quot; from the selection process, if they were found to
			<lb />
			be unsuitable or unworthy of discharging their responsibility. Or even if
			<lb />
			they could not establish their usefulness. It was submitted, that this
			<lb />
			Court should not throttle the contemplated process of selection and
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, through the NJAC,
			<lb />
			without it&apos;s even having been tested.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			117. Mr. T.R. Andhyarujina, Senior Advocate, entered appearance on
			<lb />
			behalf of the State of Maharashtra. It was his contention, while endorsing
			<lb />
			the submissions advanced on behalf of the Union of India, that the
			<lb />
			impugned Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, was a rare event,
			<lb />
			inasmuch as, the Parliament unanimously passed the same, with all
			<lb />
			parties supporting the amendment. He asserted, that there was not a
			<lb />
			single vote against the amendment, even though it was conceded, that
			<lb />
			there was one Member of Parliament, who had abstained from voting.
			<lb />
			Besides the above, it was asserted, that even the State legislatures
			<lb />
			ratified the instant constitutional amendment, wherein the ruling party,
			<lb />
			as also, the parties in opposition, supported the amendment. Based on
			<lb />
			the above, it was contended, that the instant constitutional amendment,
			<lb />
			should be treated as the unanimous will of the people, belonging to all
			<lb />
			sections of the society, and therefore the same could well be treated, as
			<lb />
			the will of the nation, exercised by all stakeholders.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			118. It was submitted, that the amendment under reference should not
			<lb />
			be viewed with suspicion. It was pointed out, that Articles 124 and 217
			<lb />
			contemplated a dominating role for the executive. It was contended, that
			<lb />
			the judgment in the Second Judges case, vested primacy in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, with the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India and his collegium of Judges. This manner of selection and
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, according to learned
			<lb />
			counsel, was unknown to the rest of the world, as in no other country,
			<lb />
			the appointment of Judges is made by Judges themselves. Indicating the
			<lb />
			defects of the collegium system, it was asserted, that the same lacked
			<lb />
			transparency, and was not broad based enough. Whilst acknowledging,
			<lb />
			the view expressed by J.S. Verma, CJ., that the manner of appointment
			<lb />
			of Judges contemplated by the Second and Third Judges cases was very
			<lb />
			good, it was submitted, that J.S. Verma, CJ., himself was disillusioned
			<lb />
			with their implementation, as he felt, that there had been an utter failure
			<lb />
			on that front. Learned senior counsel submitted, that the questions that
			<lb />
			needed to be answered were, whether there was any fundamental
			<lb />
			illegality in the constitutional amendment? Or, whether the appointment
			<lb />
			of Judges contemplated through the NJAC violated the &quot;basic structure&quot;
			<lb />
			of the Constitution? And, whether the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;
			<lb />
			stood subverted by the impugned constitutional amendment? It was
			<lb />
			asserted, that it was wrong to assume, that the manner of appointment
			<lb />
			of Judges, had any impact on the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. In this
			<lb />
			behalf, it was pointed out, that the independence of Judges, did not
			<lb />
			depend on who appointed them. It was also pointed out, that
			<lb />
			independence of Judges depended upon their individual character.
			<lb />
			Learned counsel reiterated the position expounded by Dr. B.R.
			<lb />
			Ambedkar, during the Constituent Assembly debates. He submitted, that
			<lb />
			the concept of &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; should not be determined
			<lb />
			with reference to the opinion expressed by this Court in the Second and
			<lb />
			Third Judges cases, but should be determined with reference to the
			<lb />
			debates in the Constituent Assembly, which led to the crystallization of
			<lb />
			Articles 124 and 217, as originally enacted.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			119. Learned counsel placed reliance on Lord Cooke of Thorndon in his
			<lb />
			article titled &quot;Making the Angels Weep&quot;, wherein he scathingly criticized
			<lb />
			the Second Judges case. Reference was also made to his article &quot;Where
			<lb />
			Angels Fear to Tread&quot;, with reference to the Third Judges case. The
			<lb />
			Court&apos;s attention was also drawn to the criticism of the Second and Third
			<lb />
			Judges cases, at the hands of H.M. Seervai, Fali S. Nariman and others,
			<lb />
			especially the criticism at the hands of Krishna Iyer and Ruma Pal, JJ.,
			<lb />
			and later even the author of the majority judgment in the Second Judges
			<lb />
			case -J.S. Verma, CJ.. It was, accordingly, the contention of the learned
			<lb />
			senior counsel, that whilst determining the issue of &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot;, reference should not be made to either of the above two
			<lb />
			judgments, but should be made to the plain language of Articles 124 and
			<lb />
			217. Viewed in the above manner, it was asserted, that there would be no
			<lb />
			question of arriving at the conclusion, that the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment, violated the basic concepts of &quot;separation of powers&quot; and
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			120. Even though, there were no guidelines, for appointment of the two
			<lb />
			&quot;eminent persons&quot;, emerging from the Constitution (99th Amendment)
			<lb />
			Act, and/or the NJAC Act, yet it was submitted, that it was obvious, that
			<lb />
			the &quot;eminent persons&quot; to be chosen, would be persons who were well
			<lb />
			versed in the working of courts. On the Court&apos;s asking, learned senior
			<lb />
			counsel suggested, that &quot;eminent persons&quot; for the purpose could only be
			<lb />
			picked out of eminent lawyers, eminent jurists, and even retired Judges,
			<lb />
			or the like. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, it is
			<lb />
			obvious that learned senior counsel had adopted a position, diametrically
			<lb />
			opposite to the one canvassed by the learned Attorney General. Another
			<lb />
			aspect, on which we found a little divergence in the submission of Mr.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			T.R. Andhyarujina was, that in many countries the executive
			<lb />
			participation in the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, was being brought down. And in some countries it was no
			<lb />
			longer in the hands of the executive. In this behalf, the clear contention
			<lb />
			advanced by the learned senior counsel was, that the world over, the
			<lb />
			process of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary was evolving, so
			<lb />
			as to be vested in Commissions of the nature of the NJAC. And as such,
			<lb />
			it was wholly unjustified to fault the same, on the ground of
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, when the world over Commissions were
			<lb />
			found to have been discharging the responsibility satisfactorily.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			121. Mr. Tushar Mehta, Additional Solicitor General of India, entered
			<lb />
			appearance on behalf of the State of Gujarat.
			<lb />
			He adopted the
			<lb />
			submissions advanced by the learned Attorney General, as also, Mr.
			<lb />
			Ranjit Kumar, the learned Solicitor General. It was his submission, that
			<lb />
			the system innovated by this Court for appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, comprising of the Chief Justice and his collegium of
			<lb />
			Judges, was a judicial innovation. It was pointed out, that since 1993
			<lb />
			when the above system came into existence, it had been followed for
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, till the impugned
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment came into force. It was asserted that, in the
			<lb />
			interregnum, some conspicuous events had taken place, depicting the
			<lb />
			requirement of a change in the method and manner of appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges to the higher judiciary. Learned counsel invited our attention to
			<lb />
			the various Bills which were introduced in the Parliament for the purpose
			<lb />
			of setting up a Commission for appointments of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, as have already been narrated hereinbefore. It was pointed
			<lb />
			out, that several representations were received by the Government of the
			<lb />
			day, advocating the replacement of the &quot;collegium system&quot;, with a broad
			<lb />
			based National Judicial Commission, to cater to the long standing
			<lb />
			aspiration of the citizens of the country. The resultant effect was, the
			<lb />
			passing of the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, and the NJAC Act, by
			<lb />
			the Parliament. It was submitted, that the same came to be passed
			<lb />
			almost unanimously, with only one Member of Rajya Sabha abstaining. It
			<lb />
			was asserted, that this was a rare historical event after independence,
			<lb />
			when all political parties, having divergent political ideologies, voted in
			<lb />
			favour of the impugned constitutional amendment. In addition to the
			<lb />
			above, it was submitted, that as of now 28 State Assemblies had ratified
			<lb />
			the Bill. It was asserted, that the constitutional mechanism for
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, had operated for a
			<lb />
			sufficient length of time, and learning from the experience emerging out
			<lb />
			of such operation, it was felt, that a broad based Commission should be
			<lb />
			constituted. It was contended, that the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment, satisfied all the parameters for testing the constitutional
			<lb />
			validity of an amendment. Learned Additional Solicitor General similarly
			<lb />
			opposed, the submissions advanced at the hands of the petitioners
			<lb />
			challenging the inclusion of the Union Minister in charge of Law and
			<lb />
			Justice, as a Member of the NJAC. He also found merit in the inclusion
			<lb />
			of two &quot;eminent persons&quot;, in the NJAC. It was contended, that the term
			<lb />
			&quot;eminent persons&quot;, with reference to appointment of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, was by itself clear and unambiguous, and as and when, a
			<lb />
			nomination would be made, its authenticity would be understood. He
			<lb />
			distanced himself from the submission advanced by Mr. T.R.
			<lb />
			Andhyarujina, who represented the State of Maharashtra, while
			<lb />
			advancing submission about the identity of those who could be
			<lb />
			nominated as &quot;eminent persons&quot; to the NJAC. It was submitted, by
			<lb />
			placing reliance on Municipal Committee, Amritsar v. State of Punjab 82 ,
			<lb />
			K.A. Abbas v. Union of India 83 , and the A.K. Roy case 49 , that similar
			<lb />
			submissions advanced before this Court, with reference to vagueness and
			<lb />
			uncertainty of law, were consistently rejected by this Court. According to
			<lb />
			learned counsel, with reference to the alleged vagueness in the term
			<lb />
			&quot;eminent persons&quot;, in case the nomination of an individual was assailed,
			<lb />
			a court of competent jurisdiction would construe it, as far as may be, in
			<lb />
			accordance with the intention of the legislature. It was asserted, that it
			<lb />
			could not be assumed, that there was a political danger, that if two wrong
			<lb />
			persons were nominated as &quot;eminent persons&quot; to the NJAC, they would
			<lb />
			be able to tilt the balance against the judicial component of the NJAC. It
			<lb />
			was submitted, that the appointment of the two &quot;eminent persons&quot; was in
			<lb />
			the safe hands, of the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of India and the
			<lb />
			Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha. In the above view of the matter,
			<lb />
			the learned Additional Solicitor General, concluded with the prayer, that
			<lb />
			the submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			petitioners deserved to be rejected.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			122. Mr. Ravindra Srivastava, Senior Advocate, entered appearance on
			<lb />
			behalf of the State of Chhattisgarh. He had chosen to make submissions
			<lb />
			divided under eleven heads. However, keeping in view the fact, that
			<lb />
			detailed submissions had already been advanced by counsel who had
			<lb />
			entered appearance before him, he chose to limit the same. It was the
			<lb />
			primary contention of the learned senior counsel, that the impugned
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment, as also the NJAC Act, did not in any manner
			<lb />
			violate the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution. According to the learned
			<lb />
			senior counsel, the impugned constitutional amendment, furthers and
			<lb />
			strengthens the &quot;basic structure&quot; principle, of a free and independent
			<lb />
			judiciary. It was his submission, that the assertions made at the hands
			<lb />
			of the petitioners, to the effect that the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment, impinges upon the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution,
			<lb />
			and the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, were wholly misconceived. It
			<lb />
			was submitted, that this Court had not ever held, that the primacy of the
			<lb />
			judiciary through the Chief Justice of India, was an essential component
			<lb />
			of the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. It was asserted, that while
			<lb />
			considering the challenge raised by the petitioners to the impugned
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment, it would be wholly unjustified to approach the
			<lb />
			challenge by assuming, that the primacy of the judiciary through the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India, would alone satisfy the essential components of
			<lb />
			&quot;separation of power&quot; and &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the introduction of plurality, in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, was an instance of
			<lb />
			independence, rather than an instance of interference. With reference to
			<lb />
			the Members of the NJAC, it was submitted, that the same would ensure
			<lb />
			not only transparency, but also a broad based selection process, without
			<lb />
			any ulterior motives. It was asserted, that the adoption of the NJAC for
			<lb />
			selection of Judges to the higher judiciary, would result in the selection
			<lb />
			of the best out of those willing to be appointed. With reference to the
			<lb />
			participation of the Union Minister in charge of Law and Justice, as an ex
			<lb />
			officio Member of the NJAC, it was submitted, that the mere participation
			<lb />
			of one executive representative, would not make the process
			<lb />
			incompatible, with the concept of &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. In this
			<lb />
			behalf, emphatic reliance was placed on the observations of E.S.
			<lb />
			Venkataramiah, J., from two paragraphs of the First Judges case, which
			<lb />
			are being extracted hereunder:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;1033. As a part of this very contention it is urged that the Executive
			<lb />
			should have no voice at all in the matter of appointment of Judges of the
			<lb />
			superior courts in India as the independence of the judiciary which is a
			<lb />
			basic feature of the Constitution would be in serious jeopardy if the
			<lb />
			executive can interfere with the process of their appointment. It is
			<lb />
			difficult to hold that merely because the power of appointment is with the
			<lb />
			executive, the independence of the judiciary would become impaired. The
			<lb />
			true principle is that after such appointment the executive should have
			<lb />
			no scope to interfere with the work of a Judge.&quot;
			<lb />
			&quot;1038. The foregoing gives a fairly reliable picture of the English system
			<lb />
			of appointments of Judges. It is thus seen that in England the Judges
			<lb />
			are appointed by the Executive. &quot;Nevertheless, the judiciary is
			<lb />
			substantially insulated by virtue of rules of strict law, constitutional
			<lb />
			conventions, political practice and professional tradition, from political
			<lb />
			influence.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			It was finally submitted by learned counsel, that a multi-member
			<lb />
			constitutional body, was expected to act fairly and independently, and
			<lb />
			not in violation of the Constitution. It was contended, that plurality by
			<lb />
			itself was an adequate safeguard. Reliance in this behalf was placed on
			<lb />
			T.N. Seshan v. Union of India 84 , so as to eventually conclude, that the
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment did not violate the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, and that, it was in consonance with the concept of a free
			<lb />
			and independent judiciary, by further strengthening the &quot;basic structure&quot;
			<lb />
			of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			123. Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha, Senior Advocate, entered appearance on
			<lb />
			behalf of the State of Jharkhand. He asserted, that he should be taken
			<lb />
			as having adopted all the submissions addressed, on behalf of the Union
			<lb />
			of India. While commencing his submissions, he placed reliance on
			<lb />
			Article 124(4) and proviso (b) under Article 217(1) to contend, that
			<lb />
			Judges of the higher judiciary, could not be removed except by an order
			<lb />
			passed by the President, after an address by each House of Parliament,
			<lb />
			supported by a majority of the total membership of that House, and by a
			<lb />
			majority of not less than 2/3rd of the Members of the House present and
			<lb />
			voting, had been presented to the President, on the ground of proved
			<lb />
			misbehaviour or incapacity. In this behalf, learned senior counsel placed
			<lb />
			reliance on Section 16 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, which provides
			<lb />
			that the power to appoint includes the power to suspend or dismiss.
			<lb />
			Read in conjunction with Article 367, which mandates, that unless the
			<lb />
			context otherwise required, the provisions of the General Clauses Act
			<lb />
			1897, would apply to the interpretation of the provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, in the same manner as they applied to the interpretation of
			<lb />
			an Act of the legislature. Based on the aforesaid, it was sought to be
			<lb />
			asserted, that in the absence of any role of the judiciary in the matter of
			<lb />
			removal of a Judge belonging to the higher judiciary, the judiciary could
			<lb />
			not demand primacy in the matter of appointment of Judges of the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, as an integral component of the &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot;. It was submitted, on the issue of &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot;, the question of manner of appointment was far less important,
			<lb />
			than the question of removal from the position of Judge. Adverting to the
			<lb />
			manner of removal of Judges of the higher judiciary, in accordance with
			<lb />
			the provisions referred to hereinabove, it was asserted, that in the matter
			<lb />
			of removal of a Judge from the higher judiciary, there was no judicial
			<lb />
			participation. It was solely the prerogative of the legislature. That being
			<lb />
			so, it was contended, that the submissions advanced at the behest of the
			<lb />
			petitioners, that primacy in the matter of appointment of Judges, should
			<lb />
			be vested in the judiciary, was nothing but a fallacy.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			124. The second contention advanced by learned senior counsel was,
			<lb />
			that it should not be assumed as if the NJAC, would take away the power
			<lb />
			of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, from the judiciary. It
			<lb />
			was submitted, that three of the six Members of the NJAC belonged to
			<lb />
			the judiciary, and that, one of them, namely, the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			was to preside over the proceedings of the NJAC, as its Chairperson.
			<lb />
			Thus viewed, it was submitted, that it was wholly misconceived on the
			<lb />
			part of the petitioners to contend, that the power of appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges, had been taken away from the judiciary, and vested with the
			<lb />
			executive. It was submitted, that there was nothing fundamentally illegal
			<lb />
			or unconstitutional in the manner of appointment of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, as contemplated by the impugned constitutional amendment.
			<lb />
			It was also contended, that the manner of appointment of Judges,
			<lb />
			contemplated through the NJAC, could not be perceived as violative of
			<lb />
			the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution, by the mere fact, that any two
			<lb />
			Members of the NJAC can veto a proposal of appointment of a Judge to
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary. And that, the above would result in the subversion
			<lb />
			of the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. In support of the aforestated
			<lb />
			submissions, it was highlighted, that the manner of appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges, which was postulated in the judgments rendered in the Second
			<lb />
			and Third Judges cases, do not lead to the inference, that if the manner
			<lb />
			of appointment as contemplated therein was altered, it would violate the
			<lb />
			&quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			125. Mr. Yatindra Singh, learned Senior Advocate, entered appearance
			<lb />
			as an intervener. He contended, that the preamble to the Constitution of
			<lb />
			India, Article 50 (which provides for separation of the judiciary from the
			<lb />
			executive), the oath of office of a Judge appointed to the higher judiciary,
			<lb />
			the security of his tenure including the fixed age of retirement, the
			<lb />
			protection of the emoluments payable to Judges including salary and
			<lb />
			leave, etc., the fact that the Judges appointed to the higher judiciary
			<lb />
			served in Courts of Record, having the power to punish for contempt, and
			<lb />
			the provisions of the Judicial Officers Protection Act, 1850, and the
			<lb />
			Judges (Protection) Act, 1985, which grant immunity to them from civil
			<lb />
			as well as criminal proceedings, are incidents, which ensured
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. It was submitted, that the manner of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, had nothing to do with
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. It was pointed out, that insofar as the
			<lb />
			determination of the validity of the impugned constitutional amendment
			<lb />
			was concerned, it was not essential to make a reference to the judgments
			<lb />
			rendered by this Court in the Second and Third Judges cases. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the only question that needed to be determined insofar
			<lb />
			as the present controversy is concerned, was whether, the manner of
			<lb />
			appointment postulated through the NJAC, would interfere with
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of Judges&quot;. In this behalf, it was firstly asserted, that
			<lb />
			neither the Second nor the Third Judges case had concluded, that the
			<lb />
			manner of appointment of Judges would constitute the &quot;basic structure&quot;
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. Nor that, the manner of appointment of Judges to
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary as postulated in the Second and Third Judges cases,
			<lb />
			if breached, would violate the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution. It
			<lb />
			was submitted, that the judgments rendered in the Second and Third
			<lb />
			Judges cases merely interpreted the law, as it then existed. It was
			<lb />
			asserted, that the above judgments did not delve into the question,
			<lb />
			whether any factor(s) or feature(s) considered, were components of the
			<lb />
			&quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			126. Learned senior counsel, also placed reliance on the manner of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges in the United States of America, Australia, New
			<lb />
			Zealand, Canada, and Japan to contend, that in all these countries
			<lb />
			Judges appointed to the higher judiciary, were discharging their
			<lb />
			responsibilities independently, and as such, there was no reason or
			<lb />
			justification for this Court to infer, if the manner of appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges was altered from the position contemplated in the Second and
			<lb />
			Third Judges cases, to the one envisaged by the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment, it would affect the &quot;independence of the Judges&quot;. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that different countries in the world had adopted different
			<lb />
			processes of selection for appointment of Judges. Each country had
			<lb />
			achieved &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, and as such, it was
			<lb />
			presumptuous to think that Judges appointed by Judges alone, can
			<lb />
			discharge their duties independently.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			127. Learned senior counsel also pointed out, that the &quot;collegium
			<lb />
			system&quot; was not the only process of appointment of Judges, which could
			<lb />
			achieve the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. Had it been so, it would
			<lb />
			have been so concluded in the judgments rendered in the Second and
			<lb />
			Third Judges cases. It was the submission of the learned senior counsel,
			<lb />
			that &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; could be achieved by other methods,
			<lb />
			as had been adopted in other countries, or in a manner, as the
			<lb />
			Parliament deemed just and proper for India. It was asserted, that the
			<lb />
			manner of appointment contemplated by the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment had no infirmity, with reference to the issue of
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, on account of the fact, that there was
			<lb />
			hardly any participation in the NJAC, at the behest of organs other than
			<lb />
			the judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			128. Last of all, learned senior counsel contended, that the &quot;collegium
			<lb />
			system&quot; did not serve the purpose of choosing the best amongst the
			<lb />
			available. The failure of the &quot;collegium system&quot;, according to the learned
			<lb />
			senior counsel, was apparent from the opinion expressed by V.R. Krishna
			<lb />
			Iyer, J. in the foreword to the book &quot;Story of a Chief Justice&quot;, authored by
			<lb />
			U.L. Bhat, J. The &quot;collegium system&quot; was also adversely commented
			<lb />
			upon, by Ruma Pal, J., while delivering the 5 th V.M. Tarkunde Memorial
			<lb />
			Lecture on the topic &quot;An Independent Judiciary&quot;. Reference in this
			<lb />
			behalf, was also made to the observations made by S.S. Sodhi, J., a
			<lb />
			former Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court, in his book &quot;The Other
			<lb />
			Side of Justice&quot;, and the book authored by Fali S. Nariman, in his
			<lb />
			autobiography &quot;Before Memory Fades&quot;. It was contended, that the
			<lb />
			aforesaid experiences, and the adverse all around comments, with
			<lb />
			reference to the implementation of the &quot;collegium system&quot;, forced the
			<lb />
			Parliament to enact the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, which
			<lb />
			provided for a far better method for selection and appointment of Judges
			<lb />
			to the higher judiciary, than the procedure contemplated under the
			<lb />
			&quot;collegium system&quot;. It was submitted, that whilst the NJAC did not
			<lb />
			exclude the role of the judiciary, it included two &quot;eminent persons&quot; with
			<lb />
			one executive nominee, namely, the Union Minister in charge of Law and
			<lb />
			Justice, as Members of the NJAC. Since the role of the
			<lb />
			executive/Government in the NJAC was minimal, it was preposterous to
			<lb />
			assume, that the executive would ever be able to have its way, in the
			<lb />
			matter of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the NJAC would fulfill the objective of transparency, in
			<lb />
			the matter of appointment of Judges, and at the same time, would make
			<lb />
			the selection process broad based. While concluding his submissions, it
			<lb />
			was also suggested by the learned counsel, that the NJAC should be
			<lb />
			allowed to operate for some time, so as to be tested, before being
			<lb />
			scrapped at its very inception. And that, it would be improper to negate
			<lb />
			the process even before the experiment had begun.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			129. Mr. Dushyant A. Dave, Senior Advocate and President of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court Bar Association, submitted that the only question that
			<lb />
			needed to be adjudicated upon, with reference to the present controversy
			<lb />
			was, whether the manner of appointment of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, through the NJAC, would fall within the constitutional frame
			<lb />
			work? Learned senior counsel commenced his submissions by
			<lb />
			highlighting the fact, that parliamentary democracy contemplated
			<lb />
			through the provisions of the Constitution, was a greater basic concept,
			<lb />
			as compared to the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. It was submitted,
			<lb />
			that the manner in which submissions had been advanced at the behest
			<lb />
			of the petitioners, it seemed, that the matter of appointment of Judges to
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary, is placed at the highest pedestal, in the &quot;basic
			<lb />
			structure doctrine&quot;. Learned senior counsel seriously contested the
			<lb />
			veracity of the aforesaid belief. It was submitted, that if those
			<lb />
			representing the petitioners, were placing reliance on the judgment
			<lb />
			rendered in the Second Judges case, to project the aforesaid principle, it
			<lb />
			was legally fallacious, to do so. The reason, according to learned senior
			<lb />
			counsel was, that the judgment in the Second Judges case, was not
			<lb />
			premised on an interpretation of any constitutional provision(s), nor was
			<lb />
			it premised on an elaborate discussion, with reference to the subject
			<lb />
			under consideration, nor was reliance placed on the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly debates. It was pointed out, that the judgment in the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case was rendered, on the basis of the principles contemplated by
			<lb />
			the authors of the judgment, and not on any principles of law. It was
			<lb />
			accordingly asserted, that the petitioners&apos; contentions, deserved outright
			<lb />
			rejection.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			130. Learned senior counsel invited this Court&apos;s attention to the fact,
			<lb />
			that the judgments rendered in the Kesavananda Bharati case 10 , the
			<lb />
			Minerva Mills Ltd. case 33 , and I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu 85 ,
			<lb />
			wherein the concept of &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution was
			<lb />
			formulated and given effect to, were all matters wherein on different
			<lb />
			aspects, the power of judicial review had been suppressed/subjugated. It
			<lb />
			was submitted, that none of the aforesaid judgments could be relied
			<lb />
			upon to determine, whether the manner of appointment of the Judges to
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary, constituted a part of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. It was therefore, that reliance was placed on Article 368 to
			<lb />
			contend, that the power to amend the Constitution, had been described
			<lb />
			as a &quot;constituent power&quot;, i.e., a power similar to the one which came to
			<lb />
			be vested in the Constituent Assembly, for drafting the Constitution. It
			<lb />
			was submitted, that no judgment could negate or diminish the
			<lb />
			&quot;constituent power&quot; vested with the Parliament, under Article 368.
			<lb />
			Having highlighted the aforesaid factual position, learned senior counsel
			<lb />
			advanced passionate submissions with reference to various appointments
			<lb />
			made, on the basis of the procedure postulated in the Second and Third
			<lb />
			Judges cases. Reference was pointedly made to the appointment of a
			<lb />
			particular Judge to this Court as well. It was pointed out, that the
			<lb />
			concerned Judge had decided a matter, by taking seisin of the same,
			<lb />
			even though it was not posted for hearing before him. Thereafter, even
			<lb />
			though a review petition was filed to correct the anomaly, the same was
			<lb />
			dismissed by the concerned Judge. While projecting his concern with
			<lb />
			reference to the appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary under the
			<lb />
			collegium system, learned senior counsel emphatically pointed out, that
			<lb />
			the procedure in vogue before the impugned constitutional amendment,
			<lb />
			could be described as a closed-door process, where appointments were
			<lb />
			made in a hush-hush manner.
			<lb />
			He stated that the stakeholders,
			<lb />
			including prominent lawyers with unimpeachable integrity, were never
			<lb />
			consulted. It was submitted, that inputs were never sought, from those
			<lb />
			who could render valuable assistance, for the selection of the best, from
			<lb />
			amongst those available.
			<lb />
			It was pointed out, that the process of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges under the collegium system, was known to have
			<lb />
			been abused in certain cases, and that, there were certain inherent
			<lb />
			defects therein. It was submitted, that the policy of selection, and the
			<lb />
			method of selection, were not justiciable, being not amenable to judicial
			<lb />
			review, and as such, no challenge could be raised to the wrongful
			<lb />
			appointments made under the &quot;collegium system&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			131. On the subject of the manner of interpreting the Constitution, with
			<lb />
			reference to appointments to the higher judiciary, reliance was placed on
			<lb />
			Registrar (Admn), High Court of Orissa, Cuttack v. Sisir Kanta
			<lb />
			Satapathy 32 , to contend, that in spite of having noticed the judgments
			<lb />
			rendered in the Second Judges case, this Court struck a note of caution,
			<lb />
			with reference to the control, vested in the High Courts, over the
			<lb />
			subordinate judiciary. It was pointed out, that it had been held, that
			<lb />
			control had to be exercised without usurping the power vested with the
			<lb />
			executive, especially the power under Articles 233, 234 and 235. It is
			<lb />
			submitted, that the power of the executive in the matter of appointments
			<lb />
			of Judges to the higher judiciary, could not be brushed aside, without
			<lb />
			any justification. It was contended, that it was improper to assume, that
			<lb />
			only the judiciary could appoint the best Judges, and the executive or the
			<lb />
			legislature could not.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			132. Learned senior counsel also made an impassioned reference, to the
			<lb />
			failure of the judiciary, to grant relief to the victims of the 1984 riots in
			<lb />
			Delhi, and the 2003 riots in Gujarat. It was also asserted, that justice
			<lb />
			had been denied to those who deserved it the most, namely, the poor
			<lb />
			citizenry of this country. It was pointed out, that the manner of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges, through the &quot;collegium system&quot;, had not
			<lb />
			produced Judges of the kind who were sensitive to the rights of the poor
			<lb />
			and needy. It was the assertion of the learned senior counsel, that the
			<lb />
			new system brought in for selection and appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, should be tried and tested, and in case, certain
			<lb />
			parameters had to be provided for, to ensure its righteous functioning to
			<lb />
			achieve the best results, it was always open to this Court to provide such
			<lb />
			guidelines.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			V.
			<lb />
			THE DEBATE AND THE DELIBERATION:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			I.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			133. The Union Government, as also, the participating State
			<lb />
			Governments, were all unanimous in their ventilation, that the impugned
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment, had been passed unanimously by both the
			<lb />
			Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, wherein parliamentarians from all
			<lb />
			political parties had spoken in one voice. The Lok Sabha had passed the
			<lb />
			Bill with 367 Members voting in favour of the Bill, and no one against it
			<lb />
			(the Members from the AIADMK -37 in all, had however abstained from
			<lb />
			voting). The Rajya Sabha passed the Bill with 179 Members voting in
			<lb />
			favour of the Bill, and one of its Members -Ram Jethmalani, abstaining.
			<lb />
			It was submitted, that on account of the special procedure prescribed
			<lb />
			under the proviso to Article 368(2), the Bill was ratified in no time by half
			<lb />
			the State Legislatures. Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Additional Solicitor
			<lb />
			General of India, had informed the Court, that as many as twenty-eight
			<lb />
			State Assemblies, had eventually ratified the Bill. It was assented to by
			<lb />
			the President on 31.12.2014.
			<lb />
			It was therefore asserted, that the
			<lb />
			Constitution (99th Amendment) Act manifested, the unanimous will of
			<lb />
			the people, and therefore, the same must be deemed to be expressive of
			<lb />
			the desire of the nation. Based on the fact, that impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment reflected the will of the people, it was submitted, that it
			<lb />
			would not be appropriate to test it through a process of judicial review,
			<lb />
			even on the touchstone of the concept of &quot;basic structure&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			134. Learned counsel representing the petitioners, described the
			<lb />
			aforesaid assertion as misplaced. The contention was repulsed by posing
			<lb />
			a query, whether the same was the will of the nation of the &quot;haves&quot;, or the
			<lb />
			will of the nation of the &quot;have-nots&quot;? Another question posed was,
			<lb />
			whether the impugned constitutional amendment represented the desire
			<lb />
			of the rich, the prosperous and the influential, or the poor and the needy,
			<lb />
			whose conditions, hopes and expectations had nothing to do with the
			<lb />
			impugned constitutional amendment? It was submitted, that the will of
			<lb />
			the nation, could only be decided by a plebiscite or a referendum. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the petitioners would concede, that it could certainly be
			<lb />
			described as the overwhelming will of the political-executive. And no
			<lb />
			more. It was asserted, that the impugned constitutional amendment had
			<lb />
			an oblique motive. The amendment was passed unanimously, in the
			<lb />
			opinion of the petitioners, for the simple reason, that the higher judiciary
			<lb />
			corrects the actions of the executive and the legislatures. This, it was
			<lb />
			pointed out, bothers the political-executive.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			135. With reference to the will of the people, it was submitted, that the
			<lb />
			same could easily be ascertainable from the decision rendered in the L.C
			<lb />
			Golak Nath case 41 , wherein a eleven-Judge Bench declared, that a
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment was &quot;law&quot; with reference to Part III of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, and therefore, was subject to the constraint of the
			<lb />
			fundamental rights, in the said part. It was pointed out, that the
			<lb />
			Parliament, had invoked Article 368, while passing the Constitution (25th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, 1971. By the above amendment, a law giving effect to
			<lb />
			the policy of the State under Articles 39(b) and 39(c) could not be
			<lb />
			declared void, on the ground that it was inconsistent with the
			<lb />
			fundamental rights expressed through Articles 14, 19 and 31. Article 31C
			<lb />
			also provided, that a legislative enactment containing such a
			<lb />
			&quot;declaration&quot;, namely, that it was for giving effect to the above policy of
			<lb />
			the State, would not be called in question on the ground, that it did not
			<lb />
			factually gave effect to such policy. It was pointed out, that this Court in
			<lb />
			the Kesavananda Bharati case 10 , had overruled the judgment in the I.C.
			<lb />
			Golak Nath case 41 . This Curt, while holding as unconstitutional the part
			<lb />
			of Article 31C, which denied judicial review, on the basis of the
			<lb />
			&quot;declaration&quot; referred to above, also held, that the right of judicial review
			<lb />
			was a part of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution, and its denial
			<lb />
			would result in the violation of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			136. Proceeding further, it was submitted, that on 12.6.1975, the
			<lb />
			election of Indira Gandhi to the Lok Sabha was set aside by the Allahabad
			<lb />
			High Court. That decision was assailed before the Supreme Court.
			<lb />
			Pending the appeal, the Parliament passed the Constitution (39 th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, 1975. By the above amendment, election to the
			<lb />
			Parliament, of the Prime Minister and the Speaker could not be assailed,
			<lb />
			nor could the election be held void, or be deemed to have ever become
			<lb />
			void, on any of the grounds on which an election could be declared void.
			<lb />
			In sum and substance, by a deeming fiction of law, the election of the
			<lb />
			Prime Minister and the Speaker would continue to be valid, irrespective of
			<lb />
			the defect(s) and illegalities therein. By the above amendment, it was
			<lb />
			provided, that any pending appeal before the Supreme Court would be
			<lb />
			disposed of, in conformity with the provisions of the Constitution (39 th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, 1975. The aforesaid amendment was struck down by
			<lb />
			this Court, by declaring that the same amounted to a negation of the
			<lb />
			&quot;rule of law&quot;, and also because, it was &quot;anti-democratic&quot;, and as such,
			<lb />
			violated the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution. It was submitted, that
			<lb />
			as an answer to the striking down of material parts of Article 39A of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, the Parliament while exercising its power under Article 368,
			<lb />
			had passed the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976, by an
			<lb />
			overwhelming majority. Through the above amendment, the Parliament
			<lb />
			added clauses (4) and (5) to Article 368, which read as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;(4) No amendment of this Constitution (including the provisions of Part
			<lb />
			III) made or purporting to have been made under this article whether
			<lb />
			before or after the commencement of section 55 of the Constitution
			<lb />
			(Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 shall be called in question in any
			<lb />
			court on any ground.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(5) For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that there shall be no
			<lb />
			limitation whatever on the constituent power of Parliament to amend by
			<lb />
			way of addition, variation or repeal the provisions of this Constitution
			<lb />
			under this article.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The aforesaid amendment was set aside, as being unconstitutional, by a
			<lb />
			unanimous decision, in the Minerva Mills Ltd. case 33 . It was held, that
			<lb />
			the amending power of the Parliament under Article 368 was limited,
			<lb />
			inasmuch as, it had no right to repeal or abrogate the Constitution, or to
			<lb />
			destroy its &quot;basic or essential features&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			137. Learned senior counsel pointed out, that over the years, yet another
			<lb />
			stratagem was adopted by the Parliament, for avoiding judicial
			<lb />
			interference in the working of the Parliament. In this behalf, reference
			<lb />
			was made to the Constitution (45 th Amendment) Bill, 1978, wherein it
			<lb />
			was provided, that even the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution could be
			<lb />
			amended, on its approval through a referendum. The amendment added
			<lb />
			a proviso to Article 368(2) postulating, that a law compromising with the
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; would require ratification by one half of
			<lb />
			the States, and thereupon, would become unassailable, if adopted by a
			<lb />
			simple majority vote in a referendum. Through its aforesaid action, the
			<lb />
			Government of the day, revealed its intention to compromise even the
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. Though the above Bill was passed by an
			<lb />
			overwhelming majority in the Lok Sabha, it could not muster the
			<lb />
			two-thirds majority required in the Rajya Sabha. It was pointed out, that
			<lb />
			the propounder of the Bill was the then Janata Party Government, and
			<lb />
			not the Congress Party Government (which was responsible for the
			<lb />
			emergency, and the earlier constitutional amendments). It was therefore
			<lb />
			asserted, that it should not surprise anyone, if all political parties had
			<lb />
			spoken in one voice, because all political parties were united in their
			<lb />
			resolve, to overawe and subjugate the judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			138. It was submitted, that the intention of the legislature and the
			<lb />
			executive, irrespective of the party in power, has been to invade into the
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. It was further submitted, that attempts
			<lb />
			to control the judiciary have been more pronounced in recent times. In
			<lb />
			this behalf, the Court&apos;s attention was drawn to the judgments in Lily
			<lb />
			Thomas v. Union of India 86 , and Chief Election Commissioner v. Jan
			<lb />
			Chaukidar 87 . It was pointed out, that in the former judgment, this Court
			<lb />
			held as invalid and unconstitutional, Section 8(4) of the Representation of
			<lb />
			the People Act, 1951, which provided inter alia, that a Member of
			<lb />
			Parliament convicted of an offence and sentenced to imprisonment for
			<lb />
			not less than two years, would not suffer the disqualification
			<lb />
			contemplated under the provision, for a period of three months from the
			<lb />
			date of conviction, or if the conviction was assailed by way of an appeal
			<lb />
			or revision -till such time, as the appeal or revision was disposed of. By
			<lb />
			the former judgment, convicted Members became disqualified, and had to
			<lb />
			vacate their respective seats, even though, the conviction was under
			<lb />
			challenge. In the latter judgment, this Court upheld the order passed by
			<lb />
			the Patna High Court, declaring that a person who was confined to
			<lb />
			prison, had no right to vote, by virtue of the provisions contained in
			<lb />
			Section 62(2) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Since
			<lb />
			he/she was not an elector, therefore it was held, that he/she could not
			<lb />
			be considered as qualified, to contest elections to either House of
			<lb />
			Parliament, or to a Legislative Assembly of a State.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			139. It was pointed out, that Government (then ruled by the U.P.A.)
			<lb />
			introduced a series of Bills, to invalidate the judgment rendered by this
			<lb />
			Court in the Jan Choukidar case 87 . This was sought to be done by
			<lb />
			passing the Representation of the People (Amendment and Validation)
			<lb />
			Act, 2013, within three months of the rendering of the above judgment. It
			<lb />
			was submitted, that it was wholly misconceived for the learned counsel
			<lb />
			representing the Union of India, and the concerned States to contend,
			<lb />
			that the determination by the Parliament and the State Legislatures, with
			<lb />
			reference to constitutional amendments, could be described as actions
			<lb />
			which the entire nation desired, or represented the will of the people. It
			<lb />
			was submitted, that what was patently unconstitutional, could not
			<lb />
			constitute either the desire of the nation, or the will of the people.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			140. Referring to the &quot;collegium system&quot; of appointing Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, it was pointed out, that the same was put in place by a
			<lb />
			decision rendered by a nine-Judge Bench, in the Second Judges case,
			<lb />
			through which the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; was cemented and
			<lb />
			strengthened. This could be achieved, by vesting primacy with the
			<lb />
			judiciary, in the matter of selection and appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary. It was further pointed out, that the collegium system
			<lb />
			has been under criticism, on account of lack of transparency. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that taking advantage of the above criticism, political parties
			<lb />
			across the political spectrum, have been condemning and denouncing the
			<lb />
			&quot;collegium system&quot;. Yet again, it was pointed out, that the Parliament in
			<lb />
			its effort to build inroads into the judicial system, had enacted the
			<lb />
			impugned constitutional amendment, for interfering with the judicial
			<lb />
			process. This oblique motive, it was asserted, could not be described as
			<lb />
			the will of the people, or the will of the nation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			141. In comparison, while making a reference to the impugned
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment and the NJAC Act, it was equally seriously
			<lb />
			contended, that the constitutional amendment compromised the
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, by negating the &quot;primacy of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot;. With reference to the insinuations levelled by the Union of
			<lb />
			India and the concerned State Governments, during the course of
			<lb />
			hearing, reference was made to an article bearing the title &quot;Structure
			<lb />
			Matters: The Impact of Court Structure on the Indian and U.S. Supreme
			<lb />
			Courts&quot;, authored by Nick Robinson. Reference was made to the following
			<lb />
			expositions made therein:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Given their virtual self-selection, judges on the Indian Supreme Court
			<lb />
			are viewed as less politicised than in the United States. The panel
			<lb />
			structure of the Court also prevents clear ideological blocks from being
			<lb />
			perceived (even if there are more &quot;activist&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot; judges) there
			<lb />
			is not the sense that all the judges have to assemble together for a
			<lb />
			decision to be legitimate or fair in the eyes of the public. Quite the
			<lb />
			opposite, judges are viewed as bringing different skills or backgrounds
			<lb />
			that should be selectively utilized.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			142. It was submitted, that the method of appointment, evolved through
			<lb />
			the Second and Third Judges cases, had been hailed by several jurists,
			<lb />
			who had opined that the same could be treated as a precedent worthy of
			<lb />
			emulation by the United Kingdom. Reference in this behalf was also
			<lb />
			made to, the opinion of Lord Templeman, a Member of the House of Lords
			<lb />
			in the United Kingdom.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			143. Having given our thoughtful consideration to the position assumed
			<lb />
			by the learned counsel representing the rival parties, it is essential to
			<lb />
			hold, that every constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament,
			<lb />
			either by following the ordinary procedure contemplated under Article
			<lb />
			368(2), or the special procedure contemplated in the proviso to Article
			<lb />
			368(2), could in a sense of understanding, by persons not conversant
			<lb />
			with the legal niceties of the issue, be treated as the will of the people, for
			<lb />
			the simple reason, that parliamentarians are considered as
			<lb />
			representatives of the people. In our view, as long as the stipulated
			<lb />
			majority supports a constitutional amendment, it would be treated as a
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment validly passed. Having satisfied the above
			<lb />
			benchmark, it may be understood as an expression of the will of the
			<lb />
			people, in the sense noticed above. The strength and enforceability of a
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment, would be just the same, irrespective of
			<lb />
			whether it was passed by the bare minimum majority postulated therefor,
			<lb />
			or by a substantial majority, or even if it was approved unanimously.
			<lb />
			What is important, is to keep in mind, that there are declared limitations,
			<lb />
			on the amending power conferred on the Parliament, which cannot be
			<lb />
			breached.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			144. An ordinary legislation enacted by the Parliament with reference to
			<lb />
			subjects contained in the Union List or the Concurrent List, and likewise,
			<lb />
			ordinary legislation enacted by State Legislatures on subjects contained
			<lb />
			in the State List and the Concurrent List, in a sense of understanding
			<lb />
			noticed above, could be treated as enactments made in consonance with
			<lb />
			the will of the people, by lay persons not conversant with the legal
			<lb />
			niceties of the issue. Herein also, there are declared limitations on the
			<lb />
			power of legislations, which cannot be violated.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			145. In almost all challenges, raised on the ground of violation of the
			<lb />
			&quot;basic structure&quot; to constitutional amendments made under Article 368,
			<lb />
			and more particularly, those requiring the compliance of the special and
			<lb />
			more rigorous procedure expressed in the proviso under Article 368(2),
			<lb />
			the repeated assertion advanced at the hands of the Union, has been the
			<lb />
			same. It has been the contention of the Union of India, that an
			<lb />
			amendment to the Constitution, passed by following the procedure
			<lb />
			expressed in the proviso to Article 368(2), constituted the will of the
			<lb />
			people, and the same was not subject to judicial review. The same
			<lb />
			argument had been repeatedly rejected by this Court by holding, that
			<lb />
			Article 368 postulates only a &quot;procedure&quot; for amendment of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, and that, the same could not be treated as a &quot;power&quot; vested
			<lb />
			in the Parliament to amend the Constitution, so as to alter, the &quot;core&quot; of
			<lb />
			the Constitution, which has also been described as, the &quot;basic
			<lb />
			features/basic structure&quot; of the Constitution. The above position has
			<lb />
			been projected, through the judgments cited on behalf of the petitioners,
			<lb />
			to which reference has been made hereinabove.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			146. Therefore, even though the Parliament may have passed the
			<lb />
			Constitution (121st Amendment) Bill, with an overwhelming majority,
			<lb />
			inasmuch as, only 37 Members from the AIADMK had consciously
			<lb />
			abstained from voting in the Lok Sabha, and only one Member of the
			<lb />
			Rajya Sabha -Ram Jethmalani, had consciously abstained from voting in
			<lb />
			favour thereof, it cannot be accepted, that the same is exempted from
			<lb />
			judicial review. The scope of judicial review with reference to a
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment and/or an ordinary legislation, whether
			<lb />
			enacted by the Parliament or a State Legislature, cannot vary, so as to
			<lb />
			adopt different standards, by taking into consideration the strength of
			<lb />
			the Members of the concerned legislature, which had approved and
			<lb />
			passed the concerned Bill. If a constitutional amendment breaches the
			<lb />
			&quot;core&quot; of the Constitution or destroys its &quot;basic or essential features&quot; in a
			<lb />
			manner which was patently unconstitutional, it would have crossed over
			<lb />
			forbidden territory. This aspect, would undoubtedly fall within the realm
			<lb />
			of judicial review. In the above view of the matter, it is imperative to hold,
			<lb />
			that the impugned constitutional amendment, as also, the NJAC Act,
			<lb />
			would be subject to judicial review on the touchstone of the &quot;basic
			<lb />
			structure&quot; of the Constitution, and the parameters laid down by this
			<lb />
			Court in that behalf, even though the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment may have been approved and passed unanimously or by an
			<lb />
			overwhelming majority, and notwithstanding the ratification thereof by as
			<lb />
			many as twenty-eight State Assemblies. Accordingly, we find no merit in
			<lb />
			the contention advanced by the learned counsel for the respondents, that
			<lb />
			the impugned constitutional amendment is not assailable, through a
			<lb />
			process of judicial review.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			II.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			147. It was the submission of the learned Attorney General, that the
			<lb />
			&quot;basic features/basic structure&quot; of the Constitution, should only be
			<lb />
			gathered from a plain reading of the provision(s) of the Constitution, as
			<lb />
			it/they was/were originally enacted. In this behalf, it was acknowledged
			<lb />
			by the learned counsel representing the petitioners, that the scope and
			<lb />
			extent of the &quot;basic features/basic structure&quot; of the Constitution, was to
			<lb />
			be ascertained only from the provisions of the Constitution, as originally
			<lb />
			enacted, and additionally, from the interpretation placed on the
			<lb />
			concerned provisions, by this Court. The above qualified assertion made
			<lb />
			on behalf of the petitioners, was unacceptable to the learned counsel
			<lb />
			representing the respondents.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			148. The above disagreement, does not require any detailed analysis.
			<lb />
			The instant aspect, stands determined in the M. Nagaraj case 36 , wherein
			<lb />
			it was held as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;...The question is -whether the impugned amendments discard the
			<lb />
			original Constitution. It was vehemently urged on behalf of the
			<lb />
			petitioners that the Statement of Objects and Reasons indicates that the
			<lb />
			impugned amendments have been promulgated by Parliament to overrule
			<lb />
			the decisions of this Court. We do not find any merit in this argument.
			<lb />
			Under Article 141 of the Constitution the pronouncement of this Court is
			<lb />
			the law of the land.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			149. The cause, effect and the width of a provision, which is the basis of
			<lb />
			a challenge, may sometimes not be apparent from a plain reading thereof.
			<lb />
			The interpretation placed by this Court on a particular provision, would
			<lb />
			most certainly depict a holistic understanding thereof, wherein the plain
			<lb />
			reading would have naturally been considered, but in addition thereto,
			<lb />
			the vital silences hidden therein, based on a harmonious construction of
			<lb />
			the provision, in conjunction with the surrounding provisions, would also
			<lb />
			have been taken into consideration. The mandate of Article 141, obliges
			<lb />
			every court within the territory of India, to honour the interpretation,
			<lb />
			conclusion, or meaning assigned to a provision by this Court. It would,
			<lb />
			therefore be rightful, to interpret the provisions of the Constitution relied
			<lb />
			upon, by giving the concerned provisions, the meaning, understanding
			<lb />
			and exposition, assigned to them, on their interpretation by this Court. In
			<lb />
			the above view of the matter, it would neither be legal nor just, to persist
			<lb />
			on an understanding of the concerned provision(s), merely on the plain
			<lb />
			reading thereof, as was suggested on behalf of the respondents. Even on
			<lb />
			a plain reading of Article 141, we are obligated, to read the provisions of
			<lb />
			the Constitution, in the manner they have been interpreted by this Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			150. The manner in which the term &quot;consultation&quot; used in Articles 124,
			<lb />
			217 and 222 has been interpreted by the Supreme Court, has been
			<lb />
			considered at great length in the &quot;Reference Order&quot;, and therefore, there
			<lb />
			is no occasion for us, to re-record the same yet again. Suffice it to notice,
			<lb />
			that the term &quot;consultation&quot; contained in Articles 124, 217 and 222 will
			<lb />
			have to be read as assigning primacy to the opinion expressed by the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India (based on a decision, arrived at by a collegium of
			<lb />
			Judges), as has been concluded in the &quot;Reference Order&quot;. In the Second
			<lb />
			and Third Judges cases, the above provisions were interpreted by this
			<lb />
			Court, as they existed in their original format, i.e., in the manner in
			<lb />
			which the provisions were adopted by the Constituent Assembly, on
			<lb />
			26.11.1949 (-which took effect on 26.01.1950).
			<lb />
			Thus viewed, we
			<lb />
			reiterate, that in the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, and also, in the matter of transfer of Chief Justices and Judges
			<lb />
			from one High Court to any other High Court, under Articles 124, 217
			<lb />
			and 222, primacy conferred on the Chief Justice of India and his
			<lb />
			collegium of Judges, is liable to be accepted as an integral constituent of
			<lb />
			the above provisions (as originally enacted). Therefore, when a question
			<lb />
			with reference to the selection and appointment (as also, transfer) of
			<lb />
			Judges to the higher judiciary is raised, alleging that the &quot;independence
			<lb />
			of the judiciary&quot; as a &quot;basic feature/structure&quot; of the Constitution has
			<lb />
			been violated, it would have to be ascertained whether the primacy of the
			<lb />
			judiciary exercised through the Chief Justice of India (based on a
			<lb />
			collective wisdom of a collegium of Judges), had been breached. Then
			<lb />
			alone, would it be possible to conclude, whether or not, the
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; as an essential &quot;basic feature&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, had been preserved (-and had not been breached).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			III.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			151. We have already concluded in the &quot;Reference Order&quot;, that the term
			<lb />
			&quot;consultation&quot; used in Articles 124, 217 and 222 (as originally enacted)
			<lb />
			has to be read as vesting primacy in the judiciary, with reference to the
			<lb />
			decision making process, pertaining to the selection and appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges to the higher judiciary, and also, with reference to the transfer of
			<lb />
			Chief Justices and Judges of one High Court, to another. For arriving at
			<lb />
			the above conclusion, the following parameters were taken into
			<lb />
			consideration:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Firstly, reference was made to four judgments, namely, the
			<lb />
			Samsher Singh case 11 , rendered in 1974 by a seven-Judge Bench,
			<lb />
			wherein keeping in mind the cardinal principle -the &quot;independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary&quot;, it was concluded, that consultation with the highest
			<lb />
			dignitary in the judiciary -the Chief Justice of India, in practice meant,
			<lb />
			that the last word must belong to the Chief Justice of India, i.e., the
			<lb />
			primacy in the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary
			<lb />
			must rest with the judiciary. The above position was maintained in the
			<lb />
			Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth case 5 in 1977 by a five-Judge Bench,
			<lb />
			wherein it was held, that in all conceivable cases, advice tendered by the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India (in the course of his &quot;consultation&quot;), should
			<lb />
			principally be accepted by the Government of India, and that, if the
			<lb />
			Government departed from the counsel given by the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, the Courts would have an opportunity to examine, if any other
			<lb />
			extraneous circumstances had entered into the verdict of the executive.
			<lb />
			In the instant judgment, so as to emphasize the seriousness of the
			<lb />
			matter, this Court also expressed, that it expected, that the above words
			<lb />
			would not fall on deaf ears. The same position was adopted in the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case rendered in 1993 by a nine-Judge Bench, by a majority of
			<lb />
			7:2, which also arrived at the conclusion, that the judgment rendered in
			<lb />
			the First Judges case, did not lay down the correct law. M.M. Punchhi,
			<lb />
			J., (as he then was) one of the Judges on the Bench, who supported the
			<lb />
			minority opinion, also endorsed the view, that the action of the executive
			<lb />
			to put off the recommendation(s) made by the Chief Justice of India,
			<lb />
			would amount to an act of deprival, &quot;violating the spirit of the
			<lb />
			Constitution&quot;. In sum and substance therefore, the Second Judges case,
			<lb />
			almost unanimously concluded, that in the matter of selection and
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, primacy in the decision
			<lb />
			making process, unquestionably rested with the judiciary. Finally, the
			<lb />
			Third Judges case, rendered in 1998 by another nine-Judge Bench,
			<lb />
			reiterated the position rendered in the Second Judges case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			Secondly, the final intent emerging from the Constituent Assembly
			<lb />
			debates, based inter alia on the concluding remarks expressed by Dr.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			B.R. Ambedkar, maintained that the judiciary must be independent of
			<lb />
			the executive. The aforesaid position came to be expressed while
			<lb />
			deliberating on the subject of &quot;appointment&quot; of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar while responding to the sentiments
			<lb />
			expressed by K.T. Shah, K.M. Munshi, Tajamul Husain, Alladi
			<lb />
			Krishnaswami Aayar and Ananthasayanam Ayyangar, noted the view of
			<lb />
			the Constituent Assembly, that the Members were generally in
			<lb />
			agreement, that &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, from the executive
			<lb />
			&quot;should be made as clear and definite as it could be made by law&quot;. The
			<lb />
			above assertion made while debating on the issue of appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges to the Supreme Court, effectively resulted in the
			<lb />
			acknowledgement, that the issue of &quot;appointment&quot; of the Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, had a direct nexus with &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;.
			<lb />
			Dr. B.R. Ambedkar declined the proposal of adopting the manner of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges, prevalent in the United Kingdom and in the
			<lb />
			United States of America, and thereby, rejected the subjugation of the
			<lb />
			process of selection and appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, at
			<lb />
			the hands of the executive and the legislature respectively. While turning
			<lb />
			down the latter proposal, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was suspicious and
			<lb />
			distrustful, that in such an eventuality, appointments to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, could be impacted by &quot;political pressure&quot; and &quot;political
			<lb />
			considerations&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii) Thirdly, the actual practice and manner of appointment of Judges
			<lb />
			to the higher judiciary, emerging from the parliamentary debates, clearly
			<lb />
			depict, that absolutely all Judges (except in one case) appointed since
			<lb />
			1950, had been appointed on the advice of the Chief Justice of India. It
			<lb />
			is therefore clear, that the political-executive has been conscious of the
			<lb />
			fact, that the issue of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary,
			<lb />
			mandated the primacy of the judiciary, expressed through the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India. In this behalf, even the learned Attorney General had
			<lb />
			conceded, that the supersession of senior Judges of the Supreme Court,
			<lb />
			at the time of the appointment of the Chief Justice of India in 1973, the
			<lb />
			mass transfer of Judges of the higher judiciary during the emergency in
			<lb />
			1976, and the second supersession of a Supreme Court Judge, at the
			<lb />
			time of the appointment of the Chief Justice of India in 1977, were
			<lb />
			executive aberrations.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv) Fourthly, the Memorandum of Procedure for appointment of Judges
			<lb />
			and Chief Justices to the higher judiciary drawn in 1950, soon after India
			<lb />
			became independent, as also, the Memorandum of Procedure for
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges and Chief Justices to the higher judiciary
			<lb />
			redrawn in 1999, after the decision in the Second Judges case, manifest
			<lb />
			that, the executive had understood and accepted, that selection and
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary would emanate from, and
			<lb />
			would be made on the advice of the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(v)
			<lb />
			Fifthly, having adverted to the procedure in place for the selection
			<lb />
			and appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, the submission
			<lb />
			advanced on behalf of the respondents, that the Second and Third
			<lb />
			Judges cases had created a procedure, where Judges select and appoint
			<lb />
			Judges, or that, the system of Imperium in Imperio had been created for
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges, was considered and expressly rejected (in the
			<lb />
			&quot;Reference Order&quot;). Furthermore, the submission, that the executive had
			<lb />
			no role, in the prevailing process of selection and appointment of Judges
			<lb />
			to the higher judiciary was also rejected, by highlighting the role of the
			<lb />
			executive in the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary.
			<lb />
			Whilst recording the above conclusions, it was maintained (in the
			<lb />
			&quot;Reference Order&quot;), that primacy in the matter of appointment of Judges
			<lb />
			to the higher judiciary, was with the Chief Justice of India, and that, the
			<lb />
			same was based on the collective wisdom of a collegium of Judges.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vi) Sixthly, the contention advanced at the behest of the respondents,
			<lb />
			that even in the matter of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary
			<lb />
			(and in the matter of their transfer) under Articles 124, 217 (and 222),
			<lb />
			must be deemed to be vested in the executive, because the President by
			<lb />
			virtue of the constitutional mandate contained in Article 74, had to act in
			<lb />
			accordance with the aid and advice tendered to him by the Council of
			<lb />
			Ministers, was rejected by holding, that primacy in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, continued to remain with
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India, and that, the same was based on the collective
			<lb />
			wisdom of a collegium of Judges. In recording the above conclusion,
			<lb />
			reliance was placed on Article 50. Reliance was also placed on Article 50,
			<lb />
			for recording a further conclusion, that if the power of appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges was left to the executive, the same would breach the principles of
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; and &quot;separation of powers&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			152. In view of the above, it has to be concluded, that in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, as also, in the matter of
			<lb />
			their transfer, primacy in the decision making process, inevitably rests
			<lb />
			with the Chief Justice of India. And that, the same was expected to be
			<lb />
			expressed, on the basis of the collective wisdom, of a collegium of Judges.
			<lb />
			Having so concluded, we reject all the submissions advanced at the
			<lb />
			hands of the learned counsel for the respondents, canvassing to the
			<lb />
			contrary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			IV.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			153. The next question which arises for consideration is, whether the
			<lb />
			process of selection and appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary
			<lb />
			(i.e., Chief Justices, and Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court), and the transfer of Chief Justices and Judges of one High Court
			<lb />
			to another, contemplated through the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment, retains and preserves primacy in the decision making
			<lb />
			process, with the judiciary? It was the emphatic contention of the learned
			<lb />
			Attorney General, the learned Solicitor General, the learned Additional
			<lb />
			Solicitor General, and a sizeable number of learned senior counsel who
			<lb />
			represented the respondents, that even after the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment, primacy in the decision making process, under Articles 124,
			<lb />
			217 and 222, has been retained with the judiciary. Insofar as the instant
			<lb />
			aspect of the matter is concerned, it was contended on behalf of the
			<lb />
			respondents, that three of the six Members of the NJAC were ex officio
			<lb />
			Members drawn from the judiciary -the Chief Justice of India, and two
			<lb />
			other senior Judges of the Supreme Court, next to the Chief Justice. In
			<lb />
			conjunction with the aforesaid factual position, it was pointed out, that
			<lb />
			there was only one nominee from the political-executive -the Union
			<lb />
			Minister in charge of Law and Justice. It was submitted, that the
			<lb />
			remaining two Members, out of the six-Member NJAC, were &quot;eminent
			<lb />
			persons&quot;, who were expected to be politically neutral. Therefore,
			<lb />
			according to learned counsel representing the respondents, primacy in
			<lb />
			the matter of selection and appointment of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, and also, in the matter of transfer of Chief Justices and Judges
			<lb />
			from one High Court to another, even under the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment, continued to remain, in the hands of the judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			154. In conjunction with the aforesaid submission, it was emphatically
			<lb />
			pointed out, that the provisions of the NJAC Act postulate, that the NJAC
			<lb />
			would not recommend a person for appointment as a Judge to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, if any two Members of the NJAC, did not agree with such
			<lb />
			recommendation. Based on the fact, that the Chief Justice of India and
			<lb />
			the two other senior Judges of the Supreme Court, were ex officio
			<lb />
			Members of the NJAC, it was asserted, that the veto power for rejecting
			<lb />
			an unsuitable recommendation by the judicial component of the NJAC,
			<lb />
			would result in retaining primacy in the hands of the judiciary, in the
			<lb />
			matter of selection and appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary,
			<lb />
			and also, in the matter of transfer of Chief Justices and Judges from one
			<lb />
			High Court to another. This according to learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			respondents, was because the judicial component would be sufficient, in
			<lb />
			preventing the other Members of the NJAC, from having their way.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			155. Having given our thoughtful consideration to the above contention,
			<lb />
			there can be no doubt, that in the manner expressed by the learned
			<lb />
			counsel, the suggested inference may well be justified on paper. The
			<lb />
			important question to be considered is, whether as a matter of
			<lb />
			practicality, the impugned constitutional amendment can be considered
			<lb />
			to have sustained, primacy in the matter of decision making, under the
			<lb />
			amended provisions of Articles 124, 217 and 222, in conjunction with the
			<lb />
			inserted provisions of Articles 124A to 124C, with the judiciary?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			156. The exposition made by the learned Attorney General and some of
			<lb />
			the other learned counsel representing the respondents, emerges from an
			<lb />
			over simplified and narrow approach. The primacy vested in the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India based on the collective wisdom of a collegium of Judges,
			<lb />
			needs a holistic approach. It is not possible for us to accept, that the
			<lb />
			primacy of the judiciary would be considered to have been sustained,
			<lb />
			merely by ensuring that the judicial component in the membership of the
			<lb />
			NJAC, was sufficiently capable, to reject the candidature of an unworthy
			<lb />
			nominee. We are satisfied, that in the matter of primacy, the judicial
			<lb />
			component of the NJAC, should be competent by itself, to ensure the
			<lb />
			appointment of a worthy nominee, as well. Under the substituted
			<lb />
			scheme, even if the Chief Justice of India and the two other senior most
			<lb />
			Judges of the Supreme Court (next to the Chief Justice of India), consider
			<lb />
			a nominee to be worthy for appointment to the higher judiciary, the
			<lb />
			concerned individual may still not be appointed, if any two Members of
			<lb />
			the NJAC opine otherwise. This would be out-rightly obnoxious, to the
			<lb />
			primacy of the judicial component. The magnitude of the instant issue, is
			<lb />
			apparent from the fact that the two &quot;eminent persons&quot; (-lay persons,
			<lb />
			according to the learned Attorney General), could defeat the unanimous
			<lb />
			recommendation made by the Chief Justice of India and the two senior
			<lb />
			most Judges of the Supreme Court, favouring the appointment of an
			<lb />
			individual under consideration. Without any doubt, demeaning primacy
			<lb />
			of the judiciary, in the matter of selection and appointment of Judges to
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary. The reason to describe it as being obnoxious is this
			<lb />
			-according to the learned Attorney General, &quot;eminent persons&quot; had to be
			<lb />
			lay persons having no connection with the judiciary, or even to the
			<lb />
			profession of advocacy, perhaps individuals who may not have any law
			<lb />
			related academic qualification, such lay persons would have the collective
			<lb />
			authority, to override the collective wisdom of the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			and two Judges of the Supreme Court of India. The instant issue, is
			<lb />
			demonstrably far more retrograde, when the Union Minister in charge of
			<lb />
			Law and Justice also supports the unanimous view of the judicial
			<lb />
			component, because still the dissenting voice of the &quot;eminent persons&quot;
			<lb />
			would prevail. It is apparent, that primacy of the judiciary has been
			<lb />
			rendered a further devastating blow, by making it extremely fragile.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			157. When the issue is of such significance, as the constitutional
			<lb />
			position of Judges of the higher judiciary, it would be fatal to depend
			<lb />
			upon the moral strength of individuals. The judiciary has to be manned
			<lb />
			by people of unimpeachable integrity, who can discharge their
			<lb />
			responsibility without fear or favour. There is no question of accepting an
			<lb />
			alternative procedure, which does not ensure primacy of the judiciary in
			<lb />
			the matter of selection and appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary
			<lb />
			(as also, in the matter of transfer of Chief Justices and Judges of High
			<lb />
			Courts, to other High Courts). In the above stated position, it is not
			<lb />
			possible to conclude, that the combination contemplated for constitution
			<lb />
			of the NJAC, is such, that would not be susceptible to an easy breach of
			<lb />
			the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			158. Articles 124A(1)(a) and (b) do not provide for an adequate
			<lb />
			representation in the matter, to the judicial component, to ensure
			<lb />
			primacy of the judiciary in the matter of selection and appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges to the higher judiciary, and therefore, the same are liable to be
			<lb />
			set aside and struck down as being violative of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of
			<lb />
			the Constitution of India. Thus viewed, we are satisfied, that the &quot;basic
			<lb />
			structure&quot; of the Constitution would be clearly violated, if the process of
			<lb />
			selection of Judges to the higher judiciary was to be conducted, in the
			<lb />
			manner contemplated through the NJAC. The impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment, being ultra vires the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution, is
			<lb />
			liable to be set aside.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			V.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			159. It is surprising, that the Chief Justice of India, on account of the
			<lb />
			position he holds as pater familias of the judicial fraternity, and on
			<lb />
			account of the serious issues, that come up for judicial adjudication
			<lb />
			before him, which have immeasurable political and financial
			<lb />
			consequences, besides issues of far reaching public interest, was
			<lb />
			suspected by none other than Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, during the course of
			<lb />
			the Constituent Assembly debates, when he declined to accept the
			<lb />
			suggestions made by some Members of the Constituent Assembly, that
			<lb />
			the selection and appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary should
			<lb />
			be made with the &quot;concurrence&quot; of the Chief Justice of India, by
			<lb />
			observing, that even though the Chief Justice of India was a very eminent
			<lb />
			person, he was after all just a man with all the failings, all the
			<lb />
			sentiments, and all the prejudices, which common people have. And
			<lb />
			therefore, the Constituent Assembly did not leave it to the individual
			<lb />
			wisdom of the Chief Justice of India, but required consultation with a
			<lb />
			plurality of Judges, by including in the consultative process (at the
			<lb />
			discretion of the President of India), not only Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court of India, but also Judges of High Courts (in addition to the
			<lb />
			mandatory consultation with the Chief Justice of India). One would also
			<lb />
			ordinarily feel, that the President of India and/or the Prime Minister of
			<lb />
			India in the discharge of their onerous responsibilities in running the
			<lb />
			affairs of the country, practically all the time take decisions having far
			<lb />
			reaching consequences, not only in the matter of internal affairs of the
			<lb />
			country on the domestic front, but also in the matter of international
			<lb />
			relations with other countries. One would expect, that vesting the
			<lb />
			authority of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary with any one
			<lb />
			of them should not ordinarily be suspect of any impropriety. Yet, the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly did not allow any of them, any defined
			<lb />
			participatory role. In fact the debate in the Constituent Assembly,
			<lb />
			removed the participation of the political-executive component, because
			<lb />
			of fear of being impacted by &quot;political-pressure&quot; and &quot;political
			<lb />
			considerations&quot;. Was the view of the Constituent Assembly, and the
			<lb />
			above noted distrust, legitimate?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			160. A little personal research, resulted in the revelation of the concept
			<lb />
			of the &quot;legitimate power of reciprocity&quot;, debated by Bertram Raven in his
			<lb />
			article -&quot;The Bases of Power and the Power/Interaction Model of
			<lb />
			Interpersonal Influence&quot; (this article appeared in Analyses of Social
			<lb />
			Issues and Public Policy, Vol. 8, No.1, 2008, pp. 1-22). In addition to
			<lb />
			having dealt with various psychological reasons which influenced the
			<lb />
			personality of an individual, reference was also made to the &quot;legitimate
			<lb />
			power of reciprocity&quot;. It was pointed out, that the reciprocity norm
			<lb />
			envisaged, that if someone does something beneficial for another, the
			<lb />
			recipient would feel an obligation to reciprocate (&quot;I helped you when you
			<lb />
			needed it, so you should feel obliged to do this for me.&quot; -Goranson and
			<lb />
			Berkowitz, 1966; Gouldner, 1960). In the view expressed by the author,
			<lb />
			the inherent need of power, is universally available in the subconscious
			<lb />
			of the individual. On the satisfaction and achievement of the desired
			<lb />
			power, there is a similar unconscious desire to reciprocate the favour.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			161. The psychological concept of the &quot;legitimate power of reciprocity&quot;,
			<lb />
			was also highlighted by Dennis T. Regan of the Cornell University in his
			<lb />
			article -&quot;Effects of a Favour and Liking on Compliance&quot;. It was pointed
			<lb />
			out, that there was sufficient evidence to establish, that favours do
			<lb />
			generate feelings of obligation, and the desire to reciprocate. According to
			<lb />
			the author, the available data suggested, that a favour would lead to
			<lb />
			reported feelings of obligation, on the part of its recipient.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			162. In his book &quot;Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion&quot; -Robert
			<lb />
			Cialdini, Regent&apos;s Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Marketing at
			<lb />
			Arizona State University, in Chapter II titled -&quot;Reciprocation&quot;, expressed
			<lb />
			the view, that &quot;possibly one of the most potent compliance techniques,
			<lb />
			was the rule of reciprocation, which prompts one to repay, what someone
			<lb />
			has given to him. When a gift is extended, the recipient feels indebted to
			<lb />
			the giver, often feels uncomfortable with this indebtedness, and feels
			<lb />
			compelled to cancel the debt…often against his/her better judgment&quot;. It
			<lb />
			was pointed out, that the rule of reciprocation, was widespread across
			<lb />
			the human cultures, suggesting that it was fundamental to creating
			<lb />
			interdependencies on which societies, cultures, and civilizations were
			<lb />
			built. It was asserted, that in fact the rule of reciprocation assured, that
			<lb />
			someone who had given something away first, has a relative assurance,
			<lb />
			that this initial gift will eventually be repaid. In the above view of the
			<lb />
			matter, nothing would be lost. Referring to Marcel Nauss, who had
			<lb />
			conducted a study on gift giving, it was emphasised, that &quot;there is an
			<lb />
			obligation to give, an obligation to receive, and an obligation to repay&quot;.
			<lb />
			According to the author, it was in the above network of indebtedness,
			<lb />
			that the first giver could exploit the favour, and would rightfully assume
			<lb />
			the role of a compliance practitioner. And accordingly it was concluded,
			<lb />
			that although the obligation to repay constituted the essence of the
			<lb />
			reciprocity rule, it was the obligation to receive, that made the rule so
			<lb />
			easy to exploit. Describing the power of reciprocity, Cialdini in his article
			<lb />
			expressed, that the person who gives first remains, in control; and the
			<lb />
			person who was the recipient, always remained in debt. It is pointed out,
			<lb />
			that the above situation was often deliberately created, and
			<lb />
			psychologically maintained. It was also the view of the author, that the
			<lb />
			more valuable, substantial and helpful the original favour, the more
			<lb />
			indebted the recipient would continue to feel. In the above article, a
			<lb />
			reference was made to Alvin Gouldner, in whose opinion, there was no
			<lb />
			human society on earth, that does not follow the rule of reciprocity.
			<lb />
			Referring also to the views of the renowned cultural anthropologists -
			<lb />
			Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox, it was affirmed, that humans lived in a &quot;web
			<lb />
			of indebtedness&quot;. Therefore it was felt, that reciprocity was a debt and a
			<lb />
			powerful psychological tool, which was all, but impossible to resist.

			163. Under the constitutional scheme in place in the United States of
			<lb />
			America, federal Judges are nominated by the President, and confirmed
			<lb />
			by the Senate. The issue being debated, namely, the concept of &quot;the
			<lb />
			legitimate power of reciprocity&quot;, therefore directly arises in the United
			<lb />
			States, in the matter of appointment of federal Judges. The first favour
			<lb />
			to the federal Judge is extended by the President, who nominates his
			<lb />
			name, and further favours are extended by one or more Member(s) of the
			<lb />
			Senate, with whose support the Judge believes he won the vote of
			<lb />
			confirmation. An article titled as &quot;Loyalty, Gratitude, and the Federal
			<lb />
			Judiciary&quot;, written by Laura E. Little (Associate Professor of Law, Temple
			<lb />
			University School of Law, as far back as in 1995), deals with the issue in
			<lb />
			hand, pointedly with reference to appointment of Judges. The article
			<lb />
			reveals, that the issue of reciprocity has been a subject of conscious
			<lb />
			debate, with reference to the appointment of Judges for a substantial
			<lb />
			length of time. The conclusions drawn in the above article are relevant
			<lb />
			to the present controversy, and are being extracted hereunder:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;On the issue of impartiality, an individual undertaking a federal
			<lb />
			judgeship confronts a difficult task. Contemporary lawyers commonly
			<lb />
			agree that the law is not wholly the product of neutral principles and
			<lb />
			that a judge must choose among values as she shapes the law. Yet, the
			<lb />
			standards governing impartiality in federal courts largely assume that
			<lb />
			total judicial neutrality and dispassion are possible. The process of
			<lb />
			mapping out a personal framework for decisionmaking is therefore apt to
			<lb />
			create considerable discordance for the judge. Added to this burden are
			<lb />
			the special pulls of gratitude and loyalty toward the individuals who
			<lb />
			made possible the judge&apos;s job.
			<lb />
			I have sought to show both that gratitude and loyalty can have a
			<lb />
			powerful influence for a federal judge undertaking to decide a case. The
			<lb />
			problem is complex because loyalty and gratitude pose a greater
			<lb />
			potential problem for some judges than for others. This complexity
			<lb />
			emerges to a great degree from the process of nomination and
			<lb />
			confirmation, which often generates, or at least reinforces, a judge&apos;s
			<lb />
			sense of loyalty and gratitude to her benefactors.
			<lb />
			In the last few years, we have witnessed a wave of dissatisfaction with
			<lb />
			the selection process for federal judges. Legal scholarship in particular
			<lb />
			has offered frequent critique and constructive suggestions for change. As
			<lb />
			it must, this scholarship recognizes that any change ventured must
			<lb />
			weigh the impact of nomination and confirmation on a number of
			<lb />
			segments of American life, including the constitutional balance of powers
			<lb />
			and public perception of the judiciary.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			To omit from these concerns the effect of any change on the ultimate
			<lb />
			quality of judicial decisionmaking would, of course, be a mistake. Thus,
			<lb />
			in studying any new selection procedure, we must contemplate the
			<lb />
			procedure&apos;s potential for creating and invigorating a judge&apos;s feelings of
			<lb />
			loyalty and gratitude to her benefactors. The foregoing should, therefore,
			<lb />
			not only shed light on the process of federal court decisionmaking in
			<lb />
			general, but also give much needed guidance for evaluating proposed
			<lb />
			changes to judicial selection.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			164. It is however pertinent to mention, that in her article, Laura E. Little
			<lb />
			has expressed, what most moral philosophers believed, that gratitude has
			<lb />
			significant moral components. And further, that gratitude has a ready
			<lb />
			place in utilitarian moral systems, which were designed to ensure the
			<lb />
			greatest good for the greatest number of individuals. The concept of
			<lb />
			gratitude was however intertwined with loyalty by Laura E. Little, as in
			<lb />
			her view, gratitude and loyalty, were closely related. A beneficiary could
			<lb />
			show gratitude to a benefactor, through an expression of loyalty. The
			<lb />
			point sought to be made was, that in understanding loyalty one
			<lb />
			understands, who we are in our friendships, loves, family bonds, national
			<lb />
			ties, and religious devotion. Insofar as the patterns of behaviour in the
			<lb />
			Indian cultural system is concerned, a child is always obligated to his
			<lb />
			parents for his upbringing, and it is the child&apos;s inbuilt moral obligation, to
			<lb />
			reciprocate to his parents by extending unimpeachable loyalty and
			<lb />
			gratitude. The above position finds replication in relationships of teacher
			<lb />
			and taught, master and servant, and the like. In the existing Indian
			<lb />
			cultural scenario, an act of not reciprocating towards a benefactor, would
			<lb />
			more often than not, be treated as an act of grave moral deprivation.
			<lb />
			When the favour extended is as important as the position of judgeship in
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary, one would best leave it to individual imagination, to
			<lb />
			determine the enormity of the reciprocal gratitude and loyalty.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			165. The consideration recorded hereinabove, endorses the view, that the
			<lb />
			political-executive, as far as possible, should not have a role in the
			<lb />
			ultimate/final selection and appointment of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary. Specially keeping in mind the enormity of the participation of
			<lb />
			the political-executive, in actions of judicial adjudication. Reciprocity, and
			<lb />
			feelings of pay back to the political-executive, would be disastrous to
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. In this, we are only reiterating the
			<lb />
			position adopted by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. He feared, that with the
			<lb />
			participation of the political-executive, the selection of Judges, would be
			<lb />
			impacted by &quot;political pressure&quot; and &quot;political considerations&quot;. His view,
			<lb />
			finds support from established behavioural patterns expressed by
			<lb />
			Psychologists. It is in this background, that it needs to be ensured, that
			<lb />
			the political-executive dispensation has the least nexus, with the process
			<lb />
			of finalization of appointments of Judges to the higher judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			VI.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			166. The jurisdictions that have to be dealt with, by Judges of the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, are large and extensive. Within the above jurisdictions, there
			<lb />
			are a number of jurisdictions, in which the executive is essentially a
			<lb />
			fundamental party to the lis. This would inter alia include cases arising
			<lb />
			out of taxing statutes which have serious financial implications. The
			<lb />
			executive is singularly engaged in the exploitation of natural resources,
			<lb />
			often through private entrepreneurs. The sale of natural resources, which
			<lb />
			also, have massive financial ramifications, is often subject to judicial
			<lb />
			adjudication, wherein also, the executive is an indispensable party.
			<lb />
			Challenges arising out of orders passed by Tribunals of the nature of the
			<lb />
			Telecom Disputes Settlement &amp; Appellate Tribunal and the Appellate
			<lb />
			Tribunal for Electricity, and the like, are also dealt with by the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, where also the executive has a role. Herein also, there could be
			<lb />
			massive financial implications. The executive is also a necessary party in
			<lb />
			all matters relating to environmental issues, including appeals from the
			<lb />
			National Green Tribunals. Not only in all criminal matters, but also in
			<lb />
			high profile scams, which are no longer a rarity, the executive has an
			<lb />
			indispensable role. In these matters, sometimes accusations are levelled
			<lb />
			against former and incumbent Prime Ministers and Ministers of the
			<lb />
			Union Cabinet, and sometimes against former and incumbent Chief
			<lb />
			Ministers and Ministers of the State Cabinets. Even in the realm of
			<lb />
			employment issues, adjudication rendered by the Central Administrative
			<lb />
			Tribunal, and the Armed Forces Appellate Tribunal come up before the
			<lb />
			Judges of the higher judiciary. These adjudications also sometimes
			<lb />
			include, high ranking administrators and armed forces personnel. Herein
			<lb />
			too, the executive is an essential constituent. This is only a miniscule
			<lb />
			part of the extensive involvement of the political-executive, in litigation
			<lb />
			before the higher judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			167. Since the executive has a major stake, in a majority of cases, which
			<lb />
			arise for consideration before the higher judiciary, the participation of the
			<lb />
			Union Minister in charge of Law and Justice, as an ex officio Member of
			<lb />
			the NJAC, would be clearly questionable. In today&apos;s world, people are
			<lb />
			conscious and alive to the fact, that their rights should be adjudicated in
			<lb />
			consonance of the rules of natural justice. One of the rules of natural
			<lb />
			justice is, that the adjudicator should not be biased. This would mean,
			<lb />
			that he should neither entertain a prejudice against either party to a lis,
			<lb />
			nor should he be favourably inclined towards any of them. Another
			<lb />
			component of the rule of bias is, that the adjudicator should not have a
			<lb />
			conflict of interest, with the controversy he is to settle. When the present
			<lb />
			set of cases came up for consideration, a plea of conflict of interest was
			<lb />
			raised even against one of the presiding Judges on the Bench, which
			<lb />
			resulted in the recusal of Anil R. Dave, J. on 15.4.2015. A similar prayer
			<lb />
			was again made against one of us (J.S. Khehar, J.), on 21.4.2015, on the
			<lb />
			ground of conflict of interest. What needs to be highlighted is, that bias,
			<lb />
			prejudice, favour and conflict of interest are issues which repeatedly
			<lb />
			emerge. Judges are careful to avoid adjudication in such matters. Judges
			<lb />
			are not on one or the other side of the adjudicatory process. The
			<lb />
			political-executive in contrast, in an overwhelming majority of cases, has
			<lb />
			a participatory role.
			<lb />
			In that sense, there would/could be an
			<lb />
			impact/effect, of a decision rendered one way or the other. A success or a
			<lb />
			defeat -a win or a loss. The plea of conflict of interest would be available
			<lb />
			against the executive, if it has a participatory role in the final selection
			<lb />
			and appointment of Judges, who are then to sit in judgment over
			<lb />
			matters, wherever the executive is an essential and mandatory party. The
			<lb />
			instant issue arose for consideration in the Madras Bar Association
			<lb />
			case 35 . In the above case a five-Judge Bench considered the legality of
			<lb />
			the participation of Secretaries of Departments of the Central
			<lb />
			Government in the selection and appointment of the Chairperson and
			<lb />
			Members of the National Tax Tribunal. On the above matter, this Court
			<lb />
			held, as under:
			<lb />
			&quot;131.Section 7 cannot even otherwise be considered to be constitutionally
			<lb />
			valid, since it includes in the process of selection and appointment of the
			<lb />
			Chairperson and Members of NTT, Secretaries of Departments of the
			<lb />
			Central Government. In this behalf, it would also be pertinent to mention
			<lb />
			that the interests of the Central Government would be represented on
			<lb />
			one side in every litigation before NTT. It is not possible to accept a party
			<lb />
			to a litigation can participate in the selection process whereby the
			<lb />
			Chairperson and Members of the adjudicatory body are selected….&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			The position herein is no different. The Attorney General however
			<lb />
			attempted to distinguish the matter in hand, from the controversy
			<lb />
			decided in the cited case by asserting, that in cases adjudicated upon by
			<lb />
			the National Tax Tribunal the &quot;…Central Government would be
			<lb />
			represented on one side in every litigation …&quot; which is not the case before
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary. The rebuttal, clearly avoids the issue canvassed.
			<lb />
			One would assume from the response, that the position was conceded to
			<lb />
			the extent of matters, where the executive was a party to the lis. But that
			<lb />
			itself would exclude the selected Judges from hearing a large majority of
			<lb />
			cases. One would therefore reject the response of the Union of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			168. We are of the view, that consequent upon the participation of the
			<lb />
			Union Minister in charge of Law and Justice, a Judge approved for
			<lb />
			appointment with the Minister&apos;s support, may not be able to resist or
			<lb />
			repulse a plea of conflict of interest, raised by a litigant, in a matter when
			<lb />
			the executive has an adversarial role. In the NJAC, the Union Minister in
			<lb />
			charge of Law and Justice would be a party to all final selections and
			<lb />
			appointments of Judges to the higher judiciary. It may be difficult for
			<lb />
			Judges approved by the NJAC, to resist a plea of conflict of interest (if
			<lb />
			such a plea was to be raised, and pressed), where the political-executive
			<lb />
			is a party to the lis. The above, would have the inevitable effect of
			<lb />
			undermining the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, even where such a plea
			<lb />
			is repulsed. Therefore, the role assigned to the political-executive, can at
			<lb />
			best be limited to a collaborative participation, excluding any role in the
			<lb />
			final determination. Therefore, merely the participation of the Union
			<lb />
			Minister in charge of Law and Justice, in the final process of selection, as
			<lb />
			an ex officio Member of the NJAC, would render the amended provision of
			<lb />
			Article 124A(1)(c) as ultra vires the Constitution, as it impinges on the
			<lb />
			principles of &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; and &quot;separation of powers&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			VII.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			169. The learned Attorney General had invited our attention to the
			<lb />
			manner in which judicial appointments were being made in fifteen
			<lb />
			countries.
			<lb />
			It was submitted, that in nine countries Judges were
			<lb />
			appointed either through a Judicial Appointments Commission, or
			<lb />
			through a Judicial Appointments Committee, or through a Judicial
			<lb />
			Appointments Council. It was highlighted, that in four countries, Judges
			<lb />
			were appointed directly by the executive, i.e., by the Governor General or
			<lb />
			the President. We were informed, that in one European country, Judges
			<lb />
			were nominated by the Minister of Justice and confirmed by the
			<lb />
			Parliamentary Committee. In the United States of America, Judges were
			<lb />
			appointed through a process of nomination by the President and
			<lb />
			confirmation by the Senate. It was highlighted, that in all the fifteen
			<lb />
			countries, the executive was the final determinative/appointing
			<lb />
			authority. And further that, in all the countries, the executive had a role
			<lb />
			to play in the selection and appointment of Judges. The foresaid factual
			<lb />
			position was brought to our notice for the singular purpose of
			<lb />
			demonstrating, that executive participation in the process of selection
			<lb />
			and appointment of Judges had not made the judiciary in any of the
			<lb />
			fifteen countries, subservient to the political-executive. It was asserted,
			<lb />
			that the countries referred to by him were in different continents of the
			<lb />
			world, and there was no complaint with reference to the &quot;independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary&quot;. The point sought to be driven home was, that the mere
			<lb />
			participation of the executive in the selection and appointment of Judges
			<lb />
			to the higher judiciary, did not impinge upon the &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			170. The aforestated submission does not require an elaborate debate.
			<lb />
			Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, as the same was
			<lb />
			examined in the Second Judges case, wherein S. Ratnavel Pandian, J.,
			<lb />
			one of the Judges who passed a separate concurring order, supporting
			<lb />
			the majority view. He had rejected the submission of the nature advanced
			<lb />
			by the learned Attorney General, with the following observations:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;194. Nevertheless, we have, firstly to find out the ails from which our
			<lb />
			judicial system suffers; secondly to diagnose the root cause of those
			<lb />
			ailments under legalistic biopsies, thirdly to ascertain the nature of
			<lb />
			affliction on the system and finally to evolve a new method and strategy
			<lb />
			to treat and cure those ailments by administering and injecting a &apos;new
			<lb />
			invented medicine&apos; (meaning thereby a newly-developed method and
			<lb />
			strategy) manufactured in terms of the formula under Indian
			<lb />
			pharmacopoeia (meaning thereby according to national problems in a
			<lb />
			mixed culture etc.) but not according to American or British
			<lb />
			pharmacopoeia which are alien to our Indian system though the system
			<lb />
			adopted in other countries may throw some light for the development of
			<lb />
			our system. The outcry of some of the critics is when the power of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges in all democratic countries, far and wide, rests
			<lb />
			only with the executive, there is no substance in insisting that the
			<lb />
			primacy should be given to the opinion of the CJI in selection and
			<lb />
			appointment of candidates for judgeship. This proposition that we must
			<lb />
			copy and adopt the foreign method is a dry legal logic, which has to be
			<lb />
			rejected even on the short ground that the Constitution of India itself
			<lb />
			requires mandatory consultation with the CJI by the President before
			<lb />
			making the appointments to the superior judiciary. It has not been
			<lb />
			brought to our notice by any of the counsel for the respondents that in
			<lb />
			other countries the executive alone makes the appointments
			<lb />
			notwithstanding the existence of any existing similar constitutional
			<lb />
			provisions in their Constitutions.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			171. Despite our having dealt with the submission canvassed at the
			<lb />
			hands of the learned Attorney General based on the system of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary in fifteen countries, we
			<lb />
			consider it expedient to delve further on the subject. During the hearing
			<lb />
			of the present controversy, a paper written in November 2008, by Nuno
			<lb />
			Garoupa and Tom Ginsburg of the Law School, University of Chicago,
			<lb />
			came to hand. The paper bore the caption -&quot;Guarding the Guardians:
			<lb />
			Judicial Councils and Judicial Independence&quot;. The paper refers to
			<lb />
			comparative evidence, of the ongoing debate, about the selection and
			<lb />
			discipline of Judges. The article proclaims to aim at two objectives.
			<lb />
			Firstly, the theory of formation of Judicial Councils, and the dimensions
			<lb />
			on which they differ. And secondly, the extent to which different designs
			<lb />
			of Judicial Council, affect judicial quality.
			<lb />
			These two issues were
			<lb />
			considered as of extreme importance, as the same were determinative of
			<lb />
			the fact, whether Judges would be able to have an effective role in
			<lb />
			implementing social policy, as broadly conceived. It was observed, that
			<lb />
			Judicial Councils had come into existence to insulate the appointment,
			<lb />
			promotion and discipline of Judges from partisan political influence, and
			<lb />
			at the same time, to cater to some level of judicial accountability. It was
			<lb />
			the authors&apos; view, that the Judicial Councils lie somewhere in between
			<lb />
			the polar extremes of letting Judges manage their own affairs, and the
			<lb />
			alternative of complete political-executive control of appointments,
			<lb />
			promotions and discipline.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			172. According to the paper, France established the first High Council of
			<lb />
			the Judiciary in 1946. Italy&apos;s Judicial Council was created in 1958. Italy
			<lb />
			was the first to fully insulate the entire judiciary from political control. It
			<lb />
			was asserted, that the Italian model was, thereupon, followed in other
			<lb />
			countries. The model established in Spain and Portugal comprised of a
			<lb />
			significant proportion of Members who were Judges. These models were
			<lb />
			established, after the fall of dictatorship in these countries. Councils
			<lb />
			created by these countries, are stated to be vested with, final decision
			<lb />
			making authority, in matters pertaining to judicial promotion, tenure and
			<lb />
			removal. According to the paper, the French model came into existence
			<lb />
			as a consequence of concerns about excessive politicization. Naturally,
			<lb />
			the process evolved into extensive independence of judicial power. Yet,
			<lb />
			judicial concern multiplied manifolds in the judiciary&apos;s attempt to give
			<lb />
			effect to the European Convention of Human Rights. And the judiciary&apos;s
			<lb />
			involvement in the process of judicial review, in the backdrop of
			<lb />
			surmounting political scandals. The paper describes the pattern in Italy
			<lb />
			to be similar. In Italy also, prominent scandals led to investigation of
			<lb />
			businessmen, politicians and bureaucrats (during the period from 1992
			<lb />
			to 1997), which resulted in extensive judicial participation, in political
			<lb />
			activity. The composition of the Council in Italy, was accordingly altered
			<lb />
			in 2002, to increase the influence of the Parliament.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			173. The paper noted, that the French-Italian models had been adopted
			<lb />
			in Latin America, and other developing countries. It was pointed out,
			<lb />
			that the World Bank and other similar multilateral donor agencies, insist
			<lb />
			upon Judicial Councils, to be associated with judicial reform, for
			<lb />
			enforcement of the rule of law. The Elements of European Statute on the
			<lb />
			Judiciary, was considered as a refinement of the Judicial Council model.
			<lb />
			The perceived Supreme Council of Magistracy, requires that at least half
			<lb />
			of the Members are Judges, even though, some of the Members of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Council are drawn from the Parliament. It was the belief of the
			<lb />
			authors of the paper, that the motivating concern for adoption of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Councils, in the French-Italian tradition, was aimed at ensuring
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; after periods of undemocratic rule.
			<lb />
			Perhaps because of concerns over structural problems, it was pointed
			<lb />
			out, that external accountability had emerged as a second goal for these
			<lb />
			Supreme Councils. Referring to the Germany, Austria and Netherlands
			<lb />
			models, it was asserted, that their Councils were limited to playing a role
			<lb />
			in selection (rather than promotion and discipline) of Judges. Referring
			<lb />
			to Dutch model, it was pointed out, that recent reforms were introduced
			<lb />
			to ensure more transparency and accountability.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			174. It was also brought out, that Judicial Councils in civil law
			<lb />
			jurisdictions, had a nexus to the Supreme Court of the country.
			<lb />
			Referring to Costa Rica and Austria, it was brought out, that the Judicial
			<lb />
			Councils in these countries were a subordinate organ of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court. In some countries like Brazil, Judicial Councils were independent
			<lb />
			bodies with constitutional status, while in others Judicial Councils
			<lb />
			governed the entire judiciary. And in some others, like Guatemala and
			<lb />
			Argentina, they only governed lower courts.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			175. Referring to recruitment to the judiciary in common law countries,
			<lb />
			it was pointed out, that in the United Kingdom, the Constitutional
			<lb />
			Reform Act, 2005 created a Judicial Appointments Commission, which
			<lb />
			was responsible for appointments solely based on merit, had no executive
			<lb />
			participation. It was pointed out, that New Zealand and Australia were
			<lb />
			debating whether to follow the same. The above legislation, it was argued,
			<lb />
			postulated a statutory duty on Government Members, not to influence
			<lb />
			judicial decisions. And also, excluded the participation of the Lord
			<lb />
			Chancellor in all such activities, by transferring his functions to the
			<lb />
			President of the Courts of England and Wales, (formerly designated as
			<lb />
			Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			176. Referring to the American experience, it was noted, that concern
			<lb />
			over traditional methods of judicial selection (either by politicians or by
			<lb />
			election) had given way to &quot;Merit Commissions&quot; so as to base selection of
			<lb />
			Judges on merit. Merit Commissions, it was felt, were analogous to
			<lb />
			Judicial Councils. The system contemplated therein, was non-partisan.
			<lb />
			The Judicial Selection Commission comprised of judges, lawyers and
			<lb />
			political appointees.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			177. Referring to the works of renowned jurists on the subject, it was
			<lb />
			sought to be concluded, that in today&apos;s world, there was a strong
			<lb />
			consensus, that of all the procedures, the merit plan insulated the
			<lb />
			judiciary from political pressure. In their remarks, emerging from the
			<lb />
			survey carried out by them, it was concluded, that it was impossible to
			<lb />
			eliminate political pressure on the judiciary. Judicial Commissions/
			<lb />
			Councils created in different countries were, in their view, measures to
			<lb />
			enhance judicial independence, and to minimize political influence. It
			<lb />
			was their view that once given independence, Judges were more useful
			<lb />
			for resolving a wider range of more important disputes, which were
			<lb />
			considered essential, given the fact that more and more tasks were now
			<lb />
			being assigned to the judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			178. In analyzing the conclusions drawn in the article, one is
			<lb />
			constrained to conclude, that in the process of evolution of societies
			<lb />
			across the globe, the trend is to free the judiciary from executive and
			<lb />
			political control, and to incorporate a system of selection and
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges, based purely on merit. For it is only then, that
			<lb />
			the process of judicial review will effectively support nation building. In
			<lb />
			the subject matter, which falls for our consideration, it would be
			<lb />
			imperative for us, to keep in mind, the progression of the concepts of
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; and &quot;judicial review&quot; were now being
			<lb />
			recognized the world over. The diminishing role of executive and political
			<lb />
			participation, on the matter of appointments to the higher judiciary, is an
			<lb />
			obvious reality. In recognition of the above trend, there cannot be any
			<lb />
			greater and further participation of the executive, than that which existed
			<lb />
			hitherto before. And in the Indian scenario, as is presently conceived,
			<lb />
			through the judgments rendered in the Second and Third Judges cases.
			<lb />
			It is therefore imperative to conclude, that the participation of the Union
			<lb />
			Minister in charge of Law and Justice in the final determinative process
			<lb />
			vested in the NJAC, as also, the participation of the Prime Minister and
			<lb />
			the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha (and in case of there being
			<lb />
			none -the Leader of the single largest Opposition Party in the House of
			<lb />
			the People), in the selection of &quot;eminent persons&quot;, would be a retrograde
			<lb />
			step, and cannot be accepted.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			VIII.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			179. The only component of the NJAC, which remains to be dealt with, is
			<lb />
			with reference to the two &quot;eminent persons&quot; required to be nominated to
			<lb />
			the NJAC. It is not necessary to detail the rival submissions on the
			<lb />
			instant aspect, as they have already been noticed extensively,
			<lb />
			hereinbefore.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			180. We may proceed by accepting the undisputed position, that neither
			<lb />
			the impugned constitutional amendment, nor the NJAC Act postulate any
			<lb />
			positive qualification to be possessed by the two &quot;eminent persons&quot; to be
			<lb />
			nominated to the NJAC. These constitutional and legislative enactments
			<lb />
			do not even stipulate any negative disqualifications. It is therefore
			<lb />
			apparent, that the choice of the two &quot;eminent persons&quot; would depend on
			<lb />
			the free will of the nominating authorities. The question that arises for
			<lb />
			consideration is, whether it is just and appropriate to leave the issue, to
			<lb />
			the free will and choice, of the nominating authorities?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			181. The response of the learned Attorney General was emphatic. Who
			<lb />
			could know better than the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of India, or
			<lb />
			the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha (and when there is no such
			<lb />
			Leader of Opposition, then the Leader of the single largest Opposition
			<lb />
			Party in the Lok Sabha)? And he answered the same by himself, that if
			<lb />
			such high ranking constitutional authorities can be considered as being
			<lb />
			unaware, then no one in this country could be trusted, to be competent,
			<lb />
			to take a decision on the matter -neither the legislature, nor the
			<lb />
			executive, and not even the judiciary. The Attorney General then quipped
			<lb />
			-surely this Court would not set aside the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment, or the NJAC Act, on such a trivial issue. He also suggested,
			<lb />
			that we should await the outcome of the nominating authorities, and if
			<lb />
			this Court felt that a particular individual nominated to discharge the
			<lb />
			responsibility entrusted to him as an &quot;eminent person&quot; on the NJAC, was
			<lb />
			inappropriate or unacceptable or had no nexus with the responsibility
			<lb />
			required to be shouldered, then his appointment could be set aside.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			182. Having given our thoughtful consideration to the matter, we are of
			<lb />
			the view, that the issue in hand is certainly not as trivial, as is sought to
			<lb />
			be made out. The two &quot;eminent persons&quot; comprise of 1/3rd strength of
			<lb />
			the NJAC, and double that of the political-executive component. We could
			<lb />
			understand the import of the submission, only after hearing learned
			<lb />
			counsel. The view emphatically expressed by the Attorney General was
			<lb />
			that the &quot;eminent persons&quot; had to be &quot;lay persons&quot; having no connection
			<lb />
			with the judiciary, or even to the profession of advocacy, perhaps
			<lb />
			individuals who may not have any law related academic qualification.
			<lb />
			Mr. T.R. Andhyarujina, learned senior counsel who represented the State
			<lb />
			of Maharashtra, which had ratified the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment, had appeared to support the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment, as well as, the NJAC Act, expressed a diametrically opposite
			<lb />
			view. In his view, the &quot;eminent persons&quot; with reference to the NJAC,
			<lb />
			could only be picked out of, eminent lawyers, eminent jurists, and even
			<lb />
			retired Judges, or the like, having an insight to the working and
			<lb />
			functioning of the judicial system. It is therefore clear, that in the view of
			<lb />
			the learned senior counsel, the nominated &quot;eminent persons&quot; would have
			<lb />
			to be individuals, with a legal background, and certainly not lay persons,
			<lb />
			as was suggested by the learned Attorney General. We have recorded the
			<lb />
			submissions advanced by Mr. Dushyant A. Dave, learned senior counsel
			<lb />
			-the President of the Supreme Court Bar Association, who had
			<lb />
			addressed the Bench in his usual animated manner, with no holds
			<lb />
			barred. We solicited his view, whether it would be proper to consider the
			<lb />
			inclusion of the President of the Supreme Court Bar Association and/or
			<lb />
			the Chairman of the Bar Council of India, as ex officio Members of the
			<lb />
			NJAC in place of the two &quot;eminent persons&quot;. His response was
			<lb />
			spontaneous &quot;Please don&apos;t do that !!&quot; and then after a short pause, &quot;…
			<lb />
			that would be disastrous !!&quot;. Having examined the issue with the
			<lb />
			assistance of the most learned and eminent counsel, it is imperative to
			<lb />
			conclude, that the issue of description of the qualifications (-perhaps ,
			<lb />
			also the disqualifications) of &quot;eminent persons&quot; is of utmost importance,
			<lb />
			and cannot be left to the free will and choice of the nominating
			<lb />
			authorities, irrespective of the high constitutional positions held by them.
			<lb />
			Specially so, because the two &quot;eminent persons&quot; comprise of 1/3rd
			<lb />
			strength of the NJAC, and double that of the political-executive
			<lb />
			component, and as such, will have a supremely important role in the
			<lb />
			decision making process of the NJAC. We are therefore persuaded to
			<lb />
			accept, that Article 124A(1)(d) is liable to be set aside and struck down,
			<lb />
			for having not laid down the qualifications of eligibility for being
			<lb />
			nominated as &quot;eminent persons&quot;, and for having left the same vague and
			<lb />
			undefined.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			183. It is even otherwise difficult to appreciate the logic of including two
			<lb />
			&quot;eminent persons&quot;, in the six-Member NJAC. If one was to go by the view
			<lb />
			expressed by the learned Attorney General, &quot;eminent persons&quot; had been
			<lb />
			included in the NJAC, to infuse inputs which were hitherto not available
			<lb />
			with the prevailing selection process, for appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary. Really a submission with all loose ends, and no clear
			<lb />
			meaning. He had canvassed, that they would be &quot;lay persons&quot; having no
			<lb />
			connection with the judiciary, or even with the profession of advocacy,
			<lb />
			perhaps individuals who did not even have any law related academic
			<lb />
			qualification. It is difficult to appreciate what inputs the &quot;eminent
			<lb />
			persons&quot;, satisfying the qualification depicted by the learned Attorney
			<lb />
			General, would render in the matter of selection and appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges to the higher judiciary. The absurdity of including two &quot;eminent
			<lb />
			persons&quot; on the NJAC, can perhaps be appreciated if one were to
			<lb />
			visualize the participation of such &quot;lay persons&quot;, in the selection of the
			<lb />
			Comptroller and Auditor-General, the Chairman and Members of the
			<lb />
			Finance Commission, the Chairman and Members of the Union Public
			<lb />
			Service Commission, the Chief Election Commissioner and the Election
			<lb />
			Commissioners and the like. The position would be disastrous. In our
			<lb />
			considered view, it is imprudent to ape a system prevalent in an
			<lb />
			advanced country, with an evolved civil society.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			184. The sensitivity of selecting Judges is so enormous, and the
			<lb />
			consequences of making inappropriate appointments so dangerous, that
			<lb />
			if those involved in the process of selection and appointment of Judges to
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary, make wrongful selections, it may well lead the
			<lb />
			nation into a chaos of sorts. The role of &quot;eminent persons&quot; cannot be
			<lb />
			appreciated in the manner expressed through the impugned
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment and legislative enactment. At best, to start
			<lb />
			with, one or more &quot;eminent persons&quot; (perhaps even a committee of
			<lb />
			&quot;eminent persons&quot;), can be assigned an advisory/consultative role, by
			<lb />
			allowing them to express their opinion about the nominees under
			<lb />
			consideration. Perhaps, under the judicial component of the selection
			<lb />
			process. And possibly, comprising of eminent lawyers, eminent jurists,
			<lb />
			and even retired Judges, or the like having an insight to the working and
			<lb />
			functioning of the judicial system. And by ensuring, that the participants
			<lb />
			have no conflict of interest. Obviously, the final selecting body would not
			<lb />
			be bound by the opinion experienced, but would be obliged to keep the
			<lb />
			opinion tendered in mind, while finalizing the names of the nominated
			<lb />
			candidates.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			185. It is also difficult to appreciate the wisdom of the Parliament, to
			<lb />
			introduce two lay persons, in the process of selection and appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges to the higher judiciary, and to simultaneously vest with them a
			<lb />
			power of veto. The second proviso under Section 5(2), and Section 6(6) of
			<lb />
			the NJAC Act, clearly mandate, that a person nominated to be considered
			<lb />
			for appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court, and persons being
			<lb />
			considered for appointment as Chief Justices and Judges of High Courts,
			<lb />
			cannot be appointed, if any two Members of the NJAC do not agree to the
			<lb />
			proposal. In the scheme of the selection process of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, contemplated under the impugned constitutional amendment
			<lb />
			read with the NJAC Act, the two &quot;eminent persons&quot; are sufficiently
			<lb />
			empowered to reject all recommendations, just by themselves. Not just
			<lb />
			that, the two &quot;eminent persons&quot; would also have the absolute authority to
			<lb />
			reject all names unanimously approved by the remaining four Members
			<lb />
			of the NJAC. That would obviously include the power to reject, the
			<lb />
			unanimous recommendation of the entire judicial component of the
			<lb />
			NJAC. In our considered view, the vesting of such authority in the
			<lb />
			&quot;eminent persons&quot;, is clearly unsustainable, in the scheme of
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. Vesting of such authority on persons
			<lb />
			who have no nexus to the system of administration of justice is clearly
			<lb />
			arbitrary, and we hold it to be so. The inclusion of &quot;eminent persons&quot;, as
			<lb />
			already concluded above (refer to paragraph 156), would adversely impact
			<lb />
			primacy of the judiciary, in the matter of selection and appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges to the higher judiciary (as also their transfer). For the reasons
			<lb />
			recorded hereinabove, it is apparent, that Article 124A(1)(d) is liable to be
			<lb />
			set aside and struck down as being violative of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of
			<lb />
			the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			IX.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			186. During the course of hearing, the learned Attorney General, made
			<lb />
			some references to past appointments to the Supreme Court, so as to
			<lb />
			trumpet the accusation, that the &quot;collegium system&quot; had not functioned
			<lb />
			efficiently, inasmuch as, persons of the nature referred to by him, came
			<lb />
			to be selected and appointed as Judges of the Supreme Court. In a
			<lb />
			manner as would be in tune with the dignity of this Court, he had not
			<lb />
			referred to any of the Judge(s) by name. His reference was by deeds.
			<lb />
			Each and every individual present in the Court-hall, was aware of the
			<lb />
			identity of the concerned Judge, in the manner the submissions were
			<lb />
			advanced. The projection by the learned Attorney General was joyfully
			<lb />
			projected by the print and electronic media, extensively highlighting the
			<lb />
			allusions canvassed by the learned Attorney General.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			187. If our memory serves us right, the learned Attorney General had
			<lb />
			made a reference to the improper appointment of three Judges to the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court. One would have felt, without going into the merits of the
			<lb />
			charge, that finding fault with just three Judges, despite the appointment
			<lb />
			of over a hundred Judges to the Supreme Court, since the
			<lb />
			implementation of the judgment rendered in the Second Judges case
			<lb />
			(pronounced on 6.10.1993) -M.K. Mukherjee, J., being the first Judge
			<lb />
			appointed under the &quot;collegium system&quot; on 14.12.1993, and B.N. Kirpal,
			<lb />
			CJ., the first Chief Justice thereunder, having been appointed as Judge
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court on 11.9.1995, under the &quot;collegium system&quot;,
			<lb />
			should be considered as no mean achievement.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			188. The first on the list of the learned Attorney General was a Judge
			<lb />
			who, according to him, had hardly delivered any judgments, both during
			<lb />
			the period he remained a Judge and Chief Justice of different High
			<lb />
			Courts in the country, as also, the period during which he remained a
			<lb />
			Judge of this Court. The failure of the &quot;collegium system&quot;, was attributed
			<lb />
			to the fact, that such a person would have been weeded out, if a
			<lb />
			meaningful procedure had been in place. And despite his above
			<lb />
			disposition, the concerned Judge was further elevated to the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court. The second instance cited by him was, in respect of a Judge, who
			<lb />
			did not abide by any time schedule. It was asserted, that the Judge, was
			<lb />
			inevitably late in commencing court proceedings. It was his contention,
			<lb />
			that past experience with reference to the said Judge, indicated a similar
			<lb />
			demeanour, as a Judge of different High Courts and as Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			one High Court. It was lamented, that the above behaviour was not
			<lb />
			sufficient, in the process adopted under the &quot;collegium system&quot;, to reject
			<lb />
			the Judge from elevation to the Supreme Court. The third Judge was
			<lb />
			described as an individual, who was habitually tweeting his views, on the
			<lb />
			internet. He described him as an individual unworthy of the exalted
			<lb />
			position of a Judge of the Supreme Court, and yet, the &quot;collegium
			<lb />
			system&quot; had supported his appointment to the Supreme Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			189. Just as it was impossible to overlook a submission advanced by the
			<lb />
			Attorney General, so also, it would be improper to leave out submissions
			<lb />
			advanced on a similar note, by none other than the President of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court Bar Association. Insofar as Mr. Dushyant A. Dave, Senior
			<lb />
			Advocate, is concerned, his pointed assertion of wrongful appointments
			<lb />
			included a reference to a Judge of this Court, who had allegedly taken on
			<lb />
			his board a case, which was not assigned to his roster. It was alleged,
			<lb />
			that he had disposed of the case wrongfully. Before, we dwell on the
			<lb />
			above contention, it is necessary to notice, that the charge leveled, does
			<lb />
			not relate to an allegedly improper selection and appointment. The
			<lb />
			accusation is limited to a wrongful determination of &quot;one&quot; case. Insofar as
			<lb />
			the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, it is necessary for us to
			<lb />
			notice, that a review petition came to be filed against the alleged improper
			<lb />
			order, passed by the said Judge. The same was dismissed. After the
			<lb />
			Judge demitted office, a curative petition was filed, wherein the alleged
			<lb />
			improper order passed by the concerned Judge, was assailed. The same
			<lb />
			was also dismissed. Even thereafter, a petition was filed against the
			<lb />
			concerned Judge, by impleading him as a party-respondent. The said
			<lb />
			petition was also dismissed. We need to say no more, than what has been
			<lb />
			observed hereinabove, with reference to the particular case, allegedly
			<lb />
			wrongly decided by the concerned Judge.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			190. It is imperative for us, while taking into consideration the
			<lb />
			submissions advanced by the learned Attorney General, to highlight, that
			<lb />
			the role of appointment of Judges in consonance with the judgment
			<lb />
			rendered in the Second Judges case, envisages the dual participation of
			<lb />
			the members of the judiciary, as also, the members of the executive.
			<lb />
			Details in this behalf have been recorded by us in the &quot;Reference Order&quot;.
			<lb />
			And therefore, in case of any failure, it is not only the judicial component,
			<lb />
			but also the executive component, which are jointly and equally
			<lb />
			responsible. Therefore, to single out the judiciary for criticism, may not
			<lb />
			be a rightful reflection of the matter.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			191. It is not within our realm to express our agreement or disagreement
			<lb />
			with the contentions advanced at the hands of the learned Attorney
			<lb />
			General. He may well be right in his own perception, but the misgivings
			<lb />
			pointed out by him may not be of much significance in the perception of
			<lb />
			others, specially those who fully appreciate the working of the judicial
			<lb />
			system. The misgivings pointed out by the learned Attorney General,
			<lb />
			need to be viewed in the background of the following considerations:
			<lb />
			Firstly, the allegations levelled against the Judges in question, do not
			<lb />
			depict any lack of ability in the discharge of judicial responsibility.
			<lb />
			Surely, that is the main consideration to be taken into account, at the
			<lb />
			time of selection and appointment of an individual, as a Judge at the
			<lb />
			level of the higher judiciary.
			<lb />
			Secondly, none of the misgivings expressed on behalf of the respondents,
			<lb />
			are referable to integrity and misdemeanor. Another aspect, which cannot
			<lb />
			be compromised, at the time of selection of an individual, as a Judge at
			<lb />
			the level of the higher judiciary. Nothing wrong at this front also.
			<lb />
			Thirdly, not in a single of the instances referred to above, the
			<lb />
			political-executive had objected to the elevation of the Judges referred to.
			<lb />
			We say so, because on our asking, we were furnished with the details of
			<lb />
			those who had been elevated, despite objections at the hands of the
			<lb />
			Union-executive. None of the Judges referred to, figured in that list.
			<lb />
			Fourthly, no allegation whatsoever was made by the Attorney General,
			<lb />
			with reference to Judges, against whom objections were raised by the
			<lb />
			political-executive, and yet, they were appointed at the insistence of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice, under the &quot;collegium system&quot;.
			<lb />
			Fifthly, that the political-executive disposition, despite the allegations
			<lb />
			levelled by the learned Attorney General, chose to grant post-retirement
			<lb />
			assignments, to three of the four instances referred to, during the course
			<lb />
			of hearing. A post-retirement assignment was also allowed by the
			<lb />
			political-executive, to the Judge referred to by Mr. Dushyant A. Dave. In
			<lb />
			the above factual scenario, either the learned Attorney General had got it
			<lb />
			all wrong. And if he is right, the political-executive got it all wrong,
			<lb />
			because it faltered despite being aware of the factual position highlighted.
			<lb />
			Lastly, it has not been possible for us to comprehend, how and why, a
			<lb />
			Judge who commenced to tweet his views after his retirement, can be
			<lb />
			considered to be unworthy of elevation. The fact that the concerned
			<lb />
			Judge started tweeting his views after his retirement, is not in dispute.
			<lb />
			The inclusion of this instance may well demonstrate, that all in all, the
			<lb />
			functioning of the &quot;collegium system&quot; may well not be as bad as it is
			<lb />
			shown to be.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			192. The submissions advanced by Mr. Dushyant A. Dave were not
			<lb />
			limited just to the instance of a Judge of the Supreme Court. He
			<lb />
			expressed strong views about persons like Maya Kodnani, a former
			<lb />
			Gujarat Minister, convicted in a riots case, for having been granted relief,
			<lb />
			while an allegedly renowned activist Teesta Setalvad, had to run from
			<lb />
			pillar to post, to get anticipatory bail. He also made a reference to
			<lb />
			convicted politicians and film stars, who had been granted relief by two
			<lb />
			different High Courts, as also by this Court. It was his lament, that whilst
			<lb />
			film stars and politicians were being granted immediate relief by the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, commoners suffered for years. He attributed all this, to
			<lb />
			the defective selection process in vogue, which had resulted in the
			<lb />
			appointment of &quot;bad Judges&quot;. He repeatedly emphasized, that victims of
			<lb />
			the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in Delhi, and the 2002 anti-Muslim riots in
			<lb />
			Gujarat, had not got any justice. It was his contention, that Judges
			<lb />
			selected and appointed through the process presently in vogue, were to
			<lb />
			blame. He also expressed the view, that the appointed Judges were
			<lb />
			oblivious of violations of human rights. It was submitted, that it was
			<lb />
			shameful, that courts of law could not deliver justice, to those whose
			<lb />
			fundamental and human rights had been violated.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			193. It is necessary to emphasise, that under every system of law, there
			<lb />
			are two sides to every litigation. Only one of which succeeds. The
			<lb />
			question of how a matter has been decided would always be an issue of
			<lb />
			debate. The party, who succeeds, would feel justice had been done.
			<lb />
			While the party that loses, would complain that justice had been denied.
			<lb />
			In the judicial process, there are a set of remedies, that are available to
			<lb />
			the parties concerned. The process contemplates, culmination of
			<lb />
			proceedings at the level of the Supreme Court. Once the process has run
			<lb />
			the full circle, it is indeed futile to allege any wrong doing, except on the
			<lb />
			basis of adequate material to show otherwise. Not that, the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court is right, but that, there has to be a closure. Most of the instances,
			<lb />
			illustratively mentioned by the President of the Supreme Court Bar
			<lb />
			Association, pertained to criminal prosecutions. The adjudication of such
			<lb />
			controversies is dependent on the adequacy of evidence produced by the
			<lb />
			prosecution. The nature of the allegations (truthful, or otherwise), have
			<lb />
			an important bearing, on the interim relief(s) sought, by the parties. The
			<lb />
			blame for passing (or, not passing) the desired orders, does not therefore
			<lb />
			per se, rest on the will of the adjudicating Judge, but the quality and
			<lb />
			authenticity of the evidence produced, and the nature of the allegations.
			<lb />
			Once all remedies available stand exhausted, it does not lie in the mouth
			<lb />
			of either the litigant, or the concerned counsel to imply motives, without
			<lb />
			placing on record any further material. It also needs to be recorded, that
			<lb />
			while making the insinuations, learned senior counsel, did not make a
			<lb />
			pointed reference to any High Court Judge by name, nor was it possible
			<lb />
			for us to identify any such Judge, merely on the basis of the submissions
			<lb />
			advanced, unlike the instances with reference to Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court. In the above view of the matter, it is not possible for us to infer,
			<lb />
			that there are serious infirmities in the matter of selection and
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, under the prevailing
			<lb />
			&quot;collegium system&quot;, on the basis of the submissions advanced before us.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			194. It is apparent that learned counsel had their say, without any
			<lb />
			limitations. That was essential, to appreciate the misgivings in the
			<lb />
			prevailing procedure of selection and appointment of Judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary. We have also recorded all the submissions (hopefully) in terms
			<lb />
			of the contentions advanced, even in the absence of supporting
			<lb />
			pleadings. We will be failing in discharging our responsibility, if we do
			<lb />
			not refer to the parting words of Mr. Dushyant A. Dave -the President of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court Bar Association, who having regained his breath after
			<lb />
			his outburst, did finally concede, that still a majority of the Judges
			<lb />
			appointed to the High Courts and the Supreme Court, were/are
			<lb />
			outstanding, and a miniscule minority were &quot;bad Judges&quot;. All in all, a
			<lb />
			substantial emotional variation, from how he had commenced. One can
			<lb />
			only conclude by observing, that individual failings of men who are
			<lb />
			involved in the actual functioning of the executive, the legislature and the
			<lb />
			judiciary, do not necessarily lead to the inference, that the system which
			<lb />
			selects them, and assigns to them their role, is defective.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			X.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			195. It must remain in our minds, that the Indian Constitution is an
			<lb />
			organic document of governance, which needs to change with the
			<lb />
			evolution of civil society. We have already concluded, that for far more
			<lb />
			reasons than the ones, recorded in the Second Judges case, the term
			<lb />
			&quot;consultation&quot;, referred to selection of Judges to the higher judiciary,
			<lb />
			really meant, even in the wisdom of the framers of the Constitution, that
			<lb />
			primacy in the matter, must remain with the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			(arrived at, in consultation with a plurality of Judges). Undoubtedly, it is
			<lb />
			open to the Parliament, while exercising its power under Article 368, to
			<lb />
			provide for some other alternative procedure for the selection and
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, so long as, the attributes
			<lb />
			of &quot;separation of powers&quot; and &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, which are
			<lb />
			&quot;core&quot; components of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution, are
			<lb />
			maintained.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			196. That, however, will depend upon the standards of the moral fiber of
			<lb />
			the Indian polity. It cannot be overlooked, that the learned Attorney
			<lb />
			General had conceded, that there were certain political upheavals, which
			<lb />
			had undermined the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, including an
			<lb />
			executive overreach, at the time of appointment of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India in 1973, followed by the mass transfer of Judges of the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary during the emergency in 1976, and thereafter a second
			<lb />
			supersession, at the time of appointment of another Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			in 1977. And further, the interference by the executive, in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary during the 1980&apos;s.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			197. An important issue, that will need determination, before the organic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution is altered, in the manner contemplated by
			<lb />
			the impugned constitutional amendment, would be, whether the civil
			<lb />
			society, has been able to maneuver its leaders, towards national interest?
			<lb />
			And whether, the strength of the civil society, is of a magnitude, as would
			<lb />
			be a deterrent for any overreach, by any of the pillars of governance? At
			<lb />
			the present juncture, it seems difficult to repose faith and confidence in
			<lb />
			the civil society, to play any effective role in that direction. For the simple
			<lb />
			reason, that it is not yet sufficiently motivated, nor adequately
			<lb />
			determined, to be in a position to act as a directional deterrent, for the
			<lb />
			political-executive establishment. It is therefore, that the higher judiciary,
			<lb />
			which is the savior of the fundamental rights of the citizens of this
			<lb />
			country, by virtue of the constitutional responsibility assigned to it under
			<lb />
			Articles 32 and 226, must continue to act as the protector of the civil
			<lb />
			society. This would necessarily contemplate the obligation of preserving
			<lb />
			the &quot;rule of law&quot;, by forestalling the political-executive, from
			<lb />
			transgressing the limits of their authority as envisaged by the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			198. Lest one is accused of having recorded any sweeping inferences, it
			<lb />
			will be necessary to record the reasons, for the above conclusion. The
			<lb />
			Indian Express, on 18.6.2015, published an interview with L.K. Advani, a
			<lb />
			veteran BJP Member of Parliament in the Lok Sabha, under the caption
			<lb />
			&quot;Ahead of the 40th anniversary of the imposition of the Emergency on
			<lb />
			25.6.1975&quot;. His views were dreadfully revealing. In his opinion, forces
			<lb />
			that could crush democracy, were now stronger than ever before. He
			<lb />
			asserted, &quot;I do not think anything has been done that gives me the
			<lb />
			assurance that civil liberties will not be suspended or destroyed again.
			<lb />
			Not at all&quot;!! It was also his position, that the emergency could happen
			<lb />
			again. While acknowledging, that the media today was more alert and
			<lb />
			independent, as compared to what it was, when emergency was declared
			<lb />
			by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, forty years ago. In his
			<lb />
			perception, the media did not have any real commitment to democracy
			<lb />
			and civil liberties. With reference to the civil society, he pointed out, that
			<lb />
			hopes were raised during the Anna Hazare mobilization against
			<lb />
			corruption, which according to him, ended in a disappointment, even
			<lb />
			with reference to the subject of corruption. This when the poor and
			<lb />
			downtrodden majority of this country, can ill afford corruption. Of the
			<lb />
			various institutions, that could be held responsible, for the well
			<lb />
			functioning of democracy in this country, he expressed, that the judiciary
			<lb />
			was more responsible than the other institutions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			199. On the above interview, Mani Shankar Aiyar, a veteran Congress
			<lb />
			Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha, while expressing his views
			<lb />
			noticed, that India could not be &quot;emergency proof&quot;, till the Constitution
			<lb />
			provided for the declaration of emergency, at the discretion of an elected
			<lb />
			Government. He pointed out, that it should not be forgotten, that in
			<lb />
			1975, emergency had been declared within the framework of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. It was therefore suggested, that one of the solutions to
			<lb />
			avoid a declaration of emergency could be, to remove Part XVIII of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, or to amend it, and &quot;to provide for only an external
			<lb />
			emergency&quot;. He however raised a poser, whether it would be practical to
			<lb />
			do so? One would venture to answer the same in the negative. And in
			<lb />
			such situation, to trust, that the elected Government would act in the
			<lb />
			interest of the nation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			200. The stance of L.K. Advani was affirmed by Sitaram Yechury, a
			<lb />
			veteran CPI (Marxist) Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha, who was
			<lb />
			arrested, like L.K. Advani, during the emergency in 1975.
			<lb />
			201. The present N.D.A. Government was sworn in, on 26.5.2014. One
			<lb />
			believes, that thereafter thirteen Governors of different States and one
			<lb />
			Lieutenant Governor of a Union Territory tendered their resignations in
			<lb />
			no time. Some of the Governors demitted their office shortly after they
			<lb />
			were appointed, by the previous U.P.A. -dispensation. That is despite
			<lb />
			the fact, that a Governor under the Constitutional mandate of Article
			<lb />
			156(3) has a term of five years, from the date he enters upon his office. A
			<lb />
			Governor is chosen out of persons having professional excellence and/or
			<lb />
			personal acclaim. Each one of them, would be eligible to be nominated
			<lb />
			as an &quot;eminent person&quot; under Article 124A(1)(d). One wonders, whether
			<lb />
			all these resignations were voluntary. The above depiction is not to cast
			<lb />
			any aspersion. As a matter of fact, its predecessor -the U.P.A.
			<lb />
			Government, had done just that in 2004.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			202. It is necessary to appreciate, that the Constitution does not
			<lb />
			envisage the &quot;spoils system&quot; (also known as the &quot;patronage system&quot;),
			<lb />
			wherein the political party which wins an election, gives Government
			<lb />
			positions to its supporters, friends and relatives, as a reward for working
			<lb />
			towards victory, and as an incentive to keep the party in power.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			203. It is also relevant to indicate, the images of the &quot;spoils system&quot; are
			<lb />
			reflected from the fact, that a large number of persons holding high
			<lb />
			positions, in institutions of significance, likewise resigned from their
			<lb />
			assignments, after the present N.D.A. Government was sworn in. Some
			<lb />
			of them had just a few months before their tenure would expire -and
			<lb />
			some, even less than a month. Those who left included bureaucrats from
			<lb />
			the All India Services occupying coveted positions at the highest level,
			<lb />
			Directors/Chairmen of academic institutions of national acclaim,
			<lb />
			constitutional authorities (other than Governors), Directors/Chairmen of
			<lb />
			National Research Institutions, and the like. Seriously, the instant
			<lb />
			narration is not aimed at vilification, but of appreciation of the ground
			<lb />
			reality, how the system actually works.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			204. From the above, is one to understand, that all these individuals
			<lb />
			were rank favorites, approved by the predecessor political-executive
			<lb />
			establishment? Or, were the best not chosen to fill the slot by the
			<lb />
			previous dispensation? Could it be, that those who get to hold the reins
			<lb />
			of Government, introduce their favourites? Or, whether the existing
			<lb />
			incumbents, deserved just that? Could it be, that just like its
			<lb />
			predecessor, the present political establishment has now appointed its
			<lb />
			rank favourites? What emerges is, trappings of the spoils system, and
			<lb />
			nothing else. None of the above parameters, can be adopted in the matter
			<lb />
			of appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary. For the judiciary, the
			<lb />
			best out of those available have to be chosen. Considerations cannot be
			<lb />
			varied, with a change in Government. Demonstrably, that is exactly what
			<lb />
			has happened (repeatedly?), in the matter of non-judicial appointments.
			<lb />
			It would be of utmost importance therefore, to shield judicial
			<lb />
			appointments, from any political-executive interference, to preserve the
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, from the regime of the spoils system.
			<lb />
			Preserving primacy in the judiciary, in the matter of selection and
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the, higher judiciary would be a safe way to do
			<lb />
			so.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			205. In conclusion, it is difficult to hold, in view of the factual position
			<lb />
			expressed above, that the wisdom of appointment of Judges, can be
			<lb />
			shared with the political-executive. In India, the organic development of
			<lb />
			civil society, has not as yet sufficiently evolved. The expectation from the
			<lb />
			judiciary, to safeguard the rights of the citizens of this country, can only
			<lb />
			be ensured, by keeping it absolutely insulated and independent, from the
			<lb />
			other organs of governance. In our considered view, the present status of
			<lb />
			the evolution of the &quot;civil society&quot; in India, does not augur the
			<lb />
			participation of the political-executive establishment, in the selection and
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, or in the matter of
			<lb />
			transfer of Chief Justices and Judges of one High Court, to another.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			XI.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			206. It may be noticed, that one of the contentions advanced on behalf of
			<lb />
			the petitioners was, that after the 121st Constitution Amendment Bill
			<lb />
			was passed by the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, it was sent to the
			<lb />
			State Legislatures for ratification. Consequent upon the ratification by
			<lb />
			the State Legislatures, in compliance of the mandate contained in Article
			<lb />
			368, the President granted his assent to the same on 31.12.2014,
			<lb />
			whereupon it came to be enacted as the Constitution (99th Amendment)
			<lb />
			Act. Section 1(2) thereof provides, that the provisions of the amendment,
			<lb />
			would come into force from such date as may be notified by the Central
			<lb />
			Government, in the Official Gazette. And consequent upon the issuance
			<lb />
			of the above notification, the amendment was brought into force, through
			<lb />
			a notification, with effect from 13.4.2015. It was the submission of the
			<lb />
			petitioners, that the jurisdiction to enact the NJAC Act, was acquired by
			<lb />
			the Parliament on 13.4.2015, for the simple reason, that the same could
			<lb />
			not have been enacted whilst the prevailing Articles 124(2) and 217(1)
			<lb />
			were in force, as the same, did not provide for appointments to be made
			<lb />
			by a body such as the NJAC. It was submitted, that the NJAC Act was
			<lb />
			promulgated, to delineate the procedure to be followed by the NJAC while
			<lb />
			recommending appointments of Judges and Chief Justices, to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary. It was contended, that procedure to be followed by the NJAC
			<lb />
			could not have been legislated upon by the Parliament, till the
			<lb />
			Constitution was amended, and the NJAC was created, as a
			<lb />
			constitutional entity for the selection and appointment (as also, transfer)
			<lb />
			of Judges at the level of the higher judiciary. The NJAC, it was asserted,
			<lb />
			must be deemed to have been created, only when the Constitution (99th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, was brought into force, with effect from 13.4.2015. It
			<lb />
			was submitted, that the NJAC Act received the assent of the President on
			<lb />
			31.12.2014 i.e., on a date when the NJAC had not yet come into
			<lb />
			existence. For this, learned counsel had placed reliance on the A.K. Roy
			<lb />
			case 49 , to contend, that the constitutional amendment in the instant case
			<lb />
			would not come into force on 13.12.2014, but on 13.4.2015.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			207. A complementary additional submission was advanced on behalf of
			<lb />
			the petitioners, by relying upon the same sequence of facts. It was
			<lb />
			contended, that the power of veto vested in two Members of the NJAC,
			<lb />
			through the second proviso under Section 5(2) of the NJAC Act (in the
			<lb />
			matter of appointment of the Chief Justice and Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court), and Section 6(6) of the NJAC Act (in the matter of appointment of
			<lb />
			Chief Justices and Judges of High Courts) could not be described as
			<lb />
			laying down any procedure. It was submitted, that the above provisions
			<lb />
			clearly enacted substantive law. Likewise, it was contended, that the
			<lb />
			amendment of the words &quot;after consultation with such of the Judges of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court and the High Courts in the States as the President
			<lb />
			may deem necessary for the purpose&quot;, on being substituted by the words
			<lb />
			&quot;on the recommendation of the National Judicial Appointments
			<lb />
			Commission referred to in Article 124A&quot;, as also, the deletion of the first
			<lb />
			proviso under Article 124(2) which mandated consultation with the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, and the substitution of the same with the words, &quot;on the
			<lb />
			recommendation of the National Judicial Appointments Commission
			<lb />
			referred to under Article 124A&quot;, would result in the introduction of an
			<lb />
			absolutely new regimen. It was submitted, that such substitution would
			<lb />
			also amount to an amendment of the existing provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, and as such, the same would also require the postulated
			<lb />
			ratification provided in respect of a constitutional amendment, under the
			<lb />
			proviso to Article 368(2). And since the NJAC Act, had been enacted as
			<lb />
			an ordinary legislation, the same was liable to be held as non est on
			<lb />
			account of the fact, that the procedure contemplated under Article 368,
			<lb />
			postulated for an amendment to the Constitution, had not been followed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			208. Since it was not disputed, that the Parliament had indeed enacted
			<lb />
			Rules of Procedure and the Conduct of Business of Lok Sabha under
			<lb />
			Article 118, which contained Rule 66 postulating, that a Bill which was
			<lb />
			dependent wholly or partly on another Bill could be &quot;introduced&quot; in
			<lb />
			anticipation of the passing of the Bill, on which it was dependent.
			<lb />
			Leading to the inference, that the 121st Constitution Amendment Bill, on
			<lb />
			which the NJAC Bill was dependent, could be taken up for consideration
			<lb />
			(by introducing the same in the Parliament), but could not have been
			<lb />
			passed till after the passing of the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act,
			<lb />
			on which it was dependent.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			209. Whilst there can be no doubt, that viewed in the above perspective,
			<lb />
			we may have unhesitatingly accepted the above submission, and in fact
			<lb />
			the same was conceded by the Attorney General to the effect, that the
			<lb />
			dependent Bill can &quot;… be taken up for consideration and passing in the
			<lb />
			House, only after the first Bill has been passed by the House…&quot;. But our
			<lb />
			attention was invited by the Attorney General to Rule 388, which
			<lb />
			authorises the Speaker to allow the suspension, of a particular rule
			<lb />
			(which would include Rule 66). If Rule 66 could be suspended, then Rule
			<lb />
			66 would not have the impact, which the petitioners seek through the
			<lb />
			instant submission. It is not a matter of dispute, that the then Union
			<lb />
			Minister in charge of Law and Justice had sought (under Rule 388 of the
			<lb />
			Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business of the Lok Sabha) the
			<lb />
			suspension of the proviso to Rule 66. And on due consideration, the Lok
			<lb />
			Sabha had suspended the proviso to Rule 66, and had taken up the
			<lb />
			NJAC Bill for consideration. Since the validity of Rule 388 is not subject
			<lb />
			matter of challenge before us, it is apparent, that it was well within the
			<lb />
			competence of the Parliament, to have taken up for consideration the
			<lb />
			NJAC Act, whilst the Constitution (121st Amendment) Bill, on which the
			<lb />
			NJAC Act was fully dependent, had still not been passed, in anticipation
			<lb />
			of the passing of the Constitution (121st Amendment) Bill.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			210. The principle contained in Rule 66, even if the said rule had not
			<lb />
			been provided for, would always be deemed to have been impliedly there.
			<lb />
			In the absence of a foundation, no superstructure can be raised. The
			<lb />
			instant illustration is relateable to Rule 66, wherein the pending Bill
			<lb />
			would constitute the foundation, and the Bill being introduced in
			<lb />
			anticipation of the passing of the pending Bill, would constitute the
			<lb />
			superstructure. Therefore, in the absence of the foundational Bill (-in the
			<lb />
			instant case, the 121st Constitution Amendment Bill), there could be no
			<lb />
			question of raising the infrastructure (-in the instant case, the NJAC Act).
			<lb />
			In our considered view, it was possible in terms of Rule 388, to introduce
			<lb />
			and pass a Bill in the Parliament, in anticipation of the passing of the
			<lb />
			dependent Bill -the Constitution (121st Amendment) Bill. But, it is still
			<lb />
			not possible to contemplate, that a Bill which is dependent wholly (or, in
			<lb />
			part) upon another Bill, can be passed and brought into operation, till
			<lb />
			the dependent Bill is passed and brought into effect.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			211. It is however necessary to record, that even though the position
			<lb />
			postulated in the preceding paragraphs, as canvassed by the Attorney
			<lb />
			General, was permissible, the passing of the dependent enactment i.e.,
			<lb />
			the NJAC Bill, could not have been given effect to, till the foundational
			<lb />
			enactment had become operational. In the instant case, the NJAC Act,
			<lb />
			would have failed the test, if it was given effect to, from a date prior to the
			<lb />
			date on which, the provisions of the enactment on which it was
			<lb />
			dependent -the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, became functional.
			<lb />
			In other words, the NJAC Act, would be stillborn, if the dependent
			<lb />
			provisions, introduced by way of a constitutional amendment, were yet to
			<lb />
			come into force. Stated differently, the contravention of the principle
			<lb />
			contemplated in Rule 66, could not have been overlooked, despite the
			<lb />
			suspension of the said rule, and the dependent enactment could not
			<lb />
			come into force, before the depending/controlling provision became
			<lb />
			operational. The sequence of facts narrated hereinabove reveals, that the
			<lb />
			dependent and depending provisions, were brought into force
			<lb />
			simultaneously on the same date, i.e., on 13.4.2015. It is therefore
			<lb />
			apparent, that the foundation -the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act,
			<lb />
			was in place, when the superstructure -the NJAC Act, was raised. Thus
			<lb />
			viewed, we are satisfied, that the procedure adopted by the Parliament at
			<lb />
			the time of putting to vote the NJAC Bill, or the date on which the NJAC
			<lb />
			Act received the assent of the President, cannot invalidate the enactment
			<lb />
			of the NJAC Act, as suggested by the learned counsel for the petitioners.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			212. One is also persuaded to accept the contention advanced by the
			<lb />
			learned Attorney General, that the validity of any proceeding, in
			<lb />
			Parliament, cannot be assailed on the ground of irregularity of procedure,
			<lb />
			in view of the protection contemplated through Article 122. Whilst
			<lb />
			accepting the instant contention, of the learned Attorney General, it is
			<lb />
			necessary for us to record, that in our considered view, the aforestated
			<lb />
			irregularity pointed out by the learned counsel, would be completely
			<lb />
			beyond the purview of challenge, specially because it was not the case of
			<lb />
			the petitioners, that the Parliament did not have the legislative
			<lb />
			competence to enact the NJAC Act. For the reasons recorded
			<lb />
			hereinabove, it is not possible for us to accept, that the NJAC Act was
			<lb />
			stillborn, or that it was liable to be set aside, for the reasons canvassed
			<lb />
			by the learned counsel for the petitioners.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			213. It is also not possible for us to accept, that while enacting the NJAC
			<lb />
			Act, it was imperative for the Parliament to follow the procedure
			<lb />
			contemplated under Article 368. Insofar as the instant aspect of the
			<lb />
			matter is concerned, the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, amended
			<lb />
			Articles 124 and 217 (as also, Articles 127, 128, 222, 224, 224A and
			<lb />
			231), and Articles 124A to 124C were inserted in the Constitution. While
			<lb />
			engineering the above amendments, the procedural requirements
			<lb />
			contained in Article 368 were admittedly complied with. It is therefore
			<lb />
			apparent, that no procedural lapse was committed while enacting the
			<lb />
			Constitution (99th Amendment) Act. Article 124C, authorized the
			<lb />
			Parliament to enact a legislation in the nature of the NJAC Act. This
			<lb />
			could validly be done, by following the procedure contemplated for an
			<lb />
			ordinary legislation. It is not disputed, that such procedure, as was
			<lb />
			contemplated for enacting an ordinary legislation, had indeed been
			<lb />
			followed by the Parliament, after the NJAC Bill was tabled in the
			<lb />
			Parliament, inasmuch as, both Houses of Parliament approved the NJAC
			<lb />
			Bill by the postulated majority, and thereupon, the same received the
			<lb />
			assent of the President on 31.12.2014. For the above reasons, the
			<lb />
			instant additional submission advanced by the petitioners, cannot also
			<lb />
			be acceded to, and is accordingly declined.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			XII.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			214. Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned Attorney General for India, repulsed
			<lb />
			the contentions advanced at the hands of the petitioners, that vires of the
			<lb />
			provisions of the NJAC Act, could be challenged, on the ground of being
			<lb />
			violative of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			215. The first and foremost contention advanced, at the hands of the
			<lb />
			learned Attorney General was, that the constitutional validity of an
			<lb />
			amendment to the Constitution, could only be assailed on the basis of
			<lb />
			being violative of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution. Additionally it
			<lb />
			was submitted, that an ordinary legislative enactment (like the NJAC
			<lb />
			Act), could only be assailed on the grounds of lack of legislative
			<lb />
			competence and/or the violation of Article 13 of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			Inasmuch as, the State cannot enact laws, which take away or abridge
			<lb />
			rights conferred in Part III of the Constitution, or are in violation of any
			<lb />
			other constitutional provision. It was acknowledged, that law made in
			<lb />
			contravention of the provisions contained in Part III of the Constitution,
			<lb />
			or of any other constitutional provision, to the extent of such
			<lb />
			contravention, would be void. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter
			<lb />
			is concerned, the learned Attorney General, placed reliance on the Indira
			<lb />
			Nehru Gandhi case 56 , State of Karnataka v. Union of India 88 , and
			<lb />
			particularly to the following observations:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;238. Mr Sinha also contended that an ordinary law cannot go against
			<lb />
			the basic scheme or the fundamental backbone of the Centre-State
			<lb />
			relationship as enshrined in the Constitution. He put his argument in
			<lb />
			this respect in a very ingenious way because he felt difficulty in placing it
			<lb />
			in a direct manner by saying that an ordinary law cannot violate the
			<lb />
			basic structure of the Constitution. In the case of Smt Indira Nehru
			<lb />
			Gandhi v. Shri Raj Narain such an argument was expressedly rejected by
			<lb />
			this Court. We may rest content by referring to a passage from the
			<lb />
			judgment of our learned brother Chandrachud, J., … which runs thus:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;The constitutional amendments may, on the ratio of the Fundamental
			<lb />
			Rights case be tested on the anvil of basic structure. But apart from the
			<lb />
			principle that a case is only an authority for what it decides, it does not
			<lb />
			logically follow from the majority judgment in the Fundamental Rights
			<lb />
			case that ordinary legislation must also answer the same test as a
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment. Ordinary laws have to answer two tests for
			<lb />
			their validity: (1) The law must be within the legislative competence of the
			<lb />
			Legislature as defined and specified in Chapter I, Part 11 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution and (2) it must not offend against the provisions of Articles
			<lb />
			13(1) and (2) of the Constitution. &apos;Basic structure&apos;, by the majority
			<lb />
			judgment, is not a part of the fundamental rights nor indeed a provision
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. The theory of basic structure is woven out of the
			<lb />
			conspectus of the Constitution and the amending power is subjected to it
			<lb />
			because it is a constituent power. &apos;The power to amend the fundamental
			<lb />
			instrument cannot carry with it the power to destroy its essential
			<lb />
			features&apos;-this, in brief, is the arch of the theory of basic structure. It is
			<lb />
			wholly out of place in matters relating to the validity of ordinary laws
			<lb />
			made under the Constitution.&quot;
			<lb />
			The Court&apos;s attention was also drawn to Kuldip Nayar v. Union of India 89 ,
			<lb />
			wherein it was recorded:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;107. The basic structure theory imposes limitation on the power of
			<lb />
			Parliament to amend the Constitution. An amendment to the
			<lb />
			Constitution under Article 368 could be challenged on the ground of
			<lb />
			violation of the basic structure of the Constitution. An ordinary
			<lb />
			legislation cannot be so challenged. The challenge to a law made, within
			<lb />
			its legislative competence, by Parliament on the ground of violation of the
			<lb />
			basic structure of the Constitution is thus not available to the
			<lb />
			petitioners.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Last of all, learned Attorney General placed reliance on Ashoka Kumar
			<lb />
			Thakur v. Union of India 90 , and referred to the following observations:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;116. For determining whether a particular feature of the Constitution is
			<lb />
			part of the basic structure or not, it has to be examined in each
			<lb />
			individual case keeping in mind the scheme of the Constitution, its
			<lb />
			objects and purpose and the integrity of the Constitution as a
			<lb />
			fundamental instrument for the country&apos;s governance. It may be noticed
			<lb />
			that it is not open to challenge the ordinary legislations on the basis of
			<lb />
			the basic structure principle. State legislation can be challenged on the
			<lb />
			question whether it is violative of the provisions of the Constitution. But
			<lb />
			as regards constitutional amendments, if any challenge is made on the
			<lb />
			basis of basic structure, it has to be examined based on the basic
			<lb />
			features of the Constitution.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Based on the afore-quoted judgments, it was the assertion of the learned
			<lb />
			Attorney General, that the validity of a legislative enactment, i.e., an
			<lb />
			ordinary statute, could not be assailed on the ground, that the same was
			<lb />
			violative of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution. It was therefore
			<lb />
			asserted, that reliance placed at the hands of the learned counsel,
			<lb />
			appearing for the petitioners, on the Madras Bar Association case 35 , was
			<lb />
			not acceptable in law.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			216. The above contention, advanced by the learned Attorney General,
			<lb />
			has been repulsed. For this, in the first instance, reliance was placed on
			<lb />
			Public Services Tribunal Bar Association v. State of U.P. 91 In the instant
			<lb />
			judgment, it is seen from the observations recorded in paragraph 26, that
			<lb />
			this Court concluded, that the constitutional validity of an ordinary
			<lb />
			legislation could be challenged on only two grounds, namely, for reasons
			<lb />
			of lack of legislative competence, and on account of violation of any
			<lb />
			fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution, or of any
			<lb />
			other constitutional provision. The above determination supports the
			<lb />
			contention advanced by the learned Attorney General, who seeks to imply
			<lb />
			from the above conclusion, that an ordinary legislation cannot be
			<lb />
			assailed on the ground of it being violative of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. Despite having held as above, in its final conclusion
			<lb />
			recorded in paragraph 44, it was observed as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;44. For the reasons stated above, we find that the State Legislature
			<lb />
			was competent to enact the impugned provisions. Further, that the
			<lb />
			provisions enacted are not arbitrary and therefore not violative of Articles
			<lb />
			14, 16 or any other provisions of the Constitution. They are not against
			<lb />
			the basic structure of the Constitution of India either. Accordingly, we do
			<lb />
			not find any merit in these appeals and the same are dismissed with no
			<lb />
			order as to costs.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			It was pointed out, that it was apparent, that even while determining the
			<lb />
			validity of an ordinary legislation, namely, the U.P. Public Services
			<lb />
			(Tribunals) Act, 1976, this Court in the aforestated judgment had
			<lb />
			examined, whether the provisions of the assailed legislation, were against
			<lb />
			the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution, and having done so, it had
			<lb />
			rejected the contention. Thereby implying, that it was open for an
			<lb />
			aggrieved party to assail, even the provisions of an ordinary legislation,
			<lb />
			based on the concept of &quot;basic structure&quot;. In addition to the above,
			<lb />
			reliance was placed on the Kuldip Nayar case 89 (also relied upon by the
			<lb />
			learned Attorney General), and whilst acknowledging the position
			<lb />
			recorded in the above judgment, that an ordinary legislation could not be
			<lb />
			challenged on the ground of violation of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, the Court, in paragraph 108, had observed thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;108. As stated above, &quot;residence&quot; is not the constitutional requirement
			<lb />
			and, therefore, the question of violation of basic structure does not arise.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			It was submitted, that in the instant judgment also, this Court had
			<lb />
			independently examined, whether the legislative enactment in question,
			<lb />
			namely, the Representation of the People (Amendment) Act 40 of 2003,
			<lb />
			indeed violated the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution. And in so
			<lb />
			determining, concluded that the question of residence was not a
			<lb />
			constitutional requirement, and therefore, the question of violation of the
			<lb />
			&quot;basic structure&quot; did not arise. Learned counsel then placed reliance on
			<lb />
			the M. Nagaraj case 36 , wherein it was concluded as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;124. Subject to the above, we uphold the constitutional validity of the
			<lb />
			Constitution (Seventy-seventh Amendment) Act, 1995; the Constitution
			<lb />
			(Eighty-first Amendment) Act, 2000; the Constitution (Eighty-second
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, 2000 and the Constitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment)
			<lb />
			Act, 2001.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			125. We have not examined the validity of individual enactments of
			<lb />
			appropriate States and that question will be gone into in individual writ
			<lb />
			petition by the appropriate Bench in accordance with law laid down by us
			<lb />
			in the present case.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			217. It was submitted by Dr. Rajeev Dhavan, learned senior counsel,
			<lb />
			that this Court in the M. Nagaraj case 36 , while upholding the
			<lb />
			constitutional validity of the impugned constitutional amendment, by
			<lb />
			testing the same by applying the &quot;width test&quot;, extended the aforesaid
			<lb />
			concept to State legislations. It was accordingly sought to be inferred,
			<lb />
			that State legislations could be assailed, not only on the basis of the
			<lb />
			letter and text of constitutional provisions, but also, on the basis of the
			<lb />
			&quot;width test&quot;, which was akin to a challenge raised to a legislative
			<lb />
			enactment based on the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			218. Reliance was then placed on Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation
			<lb />
			Limited v. Rajesh Kumar 92 , wherein the issue under reference had been
			<lb />
			raised, as is apparent from the discussion in paragraph 61, which is
			<lb />
			extracted below:
			<lb />
			&quot;61. Dr. Rajeev Dhavan, learned senior Counsel, supporting the decision
			<lb />
			of the Division Bench which has declared the Rule as ultra vires, has
			<lb />
			submitted that if M. Nagaraj is properly read, it does clearly convey that
			<lb />
			social justice is an overreaching principle of the Constitution like
			<lb />
			secularism, democracy, reasonableness, social justice, etc. and it
			<lb />
			emphasises on the equality code and the parameters fixed by the
			<lb />
			Constitution Bench as the basic purpose is to bring in a state of balance
			<lb />
			but the said balance is destroyed by Section 3(7) of the 1994 Act and
			<lb />
			Rule 8-A inasmuch as no exercise has been undertaken during the post
			<lb />
			M. Nagaraj period. In M. Nagraj, there has been emphasis on
			<lb />
			interpretation and implementation, width and identity, essence of a right,
			<lb />
			the equality code and avoidance of reverse discrimination, the nuanced
			<lb />
			distinction between the adequacy and proportionality, backward class
			<lb />
			and backwardness, the concept of contest specificity as regards equal
			<lb />
			justice and efficiency, permissive nature of the provisions and conceptual
			<lb />
			essence of guided power, the implementation in concrete terms which
			<lb />
			would not cause violence to the constitutional mandate; and the effect of
			<lb />
			accelerated seniority and the conditions prevalent for satisfaction of the
			<lb />
			conditions precedent to invoke the settled principles.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			The matter was adjudicated upon as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;86. We are of the firm view that a fresh exercise in the light of the
			<lb />
			judgment of the Constitution Bench in M. Nagaraj is a categorical
			<lb />
			imperative. The stand that the constitutional amendments have
			<lb />
			facilitated the reservation in promotion with consequential seniority and
			<lb />
			have given the stamp of approval to the Act and the Rules cannot
			<lb />
			withstand close scrutiny inasmuch as the Constitution Bench has clearly
			<lb />
			opined that Articles 16(4-A) and 16(4-B) are enabling provisions and the
			<lb />
			State can make provisions for the same on certain basis or foundation.
			<lb />
			The conditions precedent have not been satisfied. No exercise has been
			<lb />
			undertaken. What has been argued with vehemence is that it is not
			<lb />
			necessary as the concept of reservation in promotion was already in
			<lb />
			vogue. We are unable to accept the said submission, for when the
			<lb />
			provisions of the Constitution are treated valid with certain conditions or
			<lb />
			riders, it becomes incumbent on the part of the State to appreciate and
			<lb />
			apply the test so that its amendments can be tested and withstand the
			<lb />
			scrutiny on parameters laid down therein.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			In addition to the above judgment, reliance was also placed on State of
			<lb />
			Bihar v. Bal Mukund Sah 93 , wherein a Constitution Bench of this Court,
			<lb />
			while examining the power of the State legislature, to legislate on the
			<lb />
			subject of recruitment of District Judges and other judicial officers,
			<lb />
			placed reliance on the judgment rendered by this Court in the
			<lb />
			Kesavananda Bharati case 10 , which took into consideration five of the
			<lb />
			declared &quot;basic features&quot; of the Constitution, and examined the subject
			<lb />
			matter in question, by applying the concept of &quot;separation of powers&quot;
			<lb />
			between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, which was
			<lb />
			accepted as an essential feature of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. Finally, reliance was placed on Nawal Kishore Mishra v.
			<lb />
			High Court of Judicature of Allahabad 94 , wherefrom reliance was placed
			<lb />
			on conclusion no. 20.11, which is extracted below:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;20.11 Any such attempt by the legislature would be forbidden by the
			<lb />
			constitutional scheme as that was found on the concept relating to
			<lb />
			separation of powers between the legislature, the executive and the
			<lb />
			judiciary as well as the fundamental concept of an independent judiciary
			<lb />
			as both the concepts having been elevated to the level of basic structure
			<lb />
			of the Constitution and are the very heart of the constitutional scheme.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			It was therefore the contention of the learned senior counsel, that it was
			<lb />
			not justified for the respondents to raise the contention, that the validity
			<lb />
			of the provisions of the NJAC Act could not be tested on the touchstone
			<lb />
			of the concept of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			219. It needs to be highlighted, that the issue under reference arose on
			<lb />
			account of the fact, that learned counsel for the petitioners had placed
			<lb />
			reliance on the judgment of this Court, in the Madras Bar Association
			<lb />
			case 35 , wherein this Court had examined the provisions of the National
			<lb />
			Tax Tribunal Act, 2005, and whilst doing so, had held the provisions of
			<lb />
			the above legislative enactment as ultra vires the provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, on account of their being violative of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of
			<lb />
			the Constitution. It is therefore quite obvious, that the instant contention
			<lb />
			was raised, to prevent the learned counsel for the petitioners, from
			<lb />
			placing reliance on the conclusions recorded in the Madras Bar
			<lb />
			Association case 35 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			220. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the above
			<lb />
			contentions. The &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution, presently inter alia
			<lb />
			includes the supremacy of the Constitution, the republican and
			<lb />
			democratic form of Government, the &quot;federal character&quot; of distribution of
			<lb />
			powers, secularism, &quot;separation of powers&quot; between the legislature, the
			<lb />
			executive, and the judiciary, and &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. This
			<lb />
			Court, while carving out each of the above &quot;basic features&quot;, placed
			<lb />
			reliance on one or more Articles of the Constitution (some times, in
			<lb />
			conjunction with the preamble of the Constitution). It goes without
			<lb />
			saying, that for carving out each of the &quot;core&quot; or &quot;basic features/basic
			<lb />
			structure&quot; of the Constitution, only the provisions of the Constitution are
			<lb />
			relied upon. It is therefore apparent, that the determination of the &quot;basic
			<lb />
			features&quot; or the &quot;basic structure&quot;, is made exclusively from the provisions
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. Illustratively, we may advert to &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot; which has been chosen because of its having been discussed
			<lb />
			and debated during the present course of consideration. The deduction
			<lb />
			of the concept of &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; emerged from a
			<lb />
			collective reading of Articles 12, 36 and 50. It is sometimes not possible,
			<lb />
			to deduce the concerned &quot;basic structure&quot; from a plain reading of the
			<lb />
			provisions of the Constitution. And at times, such a deduction is made,
			<lb />
			from the all-important silences hidden within those Articles, for instance,
			<lb />
			the &quot;primacy of the judiciary&quot; explained in the Samsher Singh case 11 the
			<lb />
			Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth case 5 and the Second Judges case, wherein
			<lb />
			this Court while interpreting Article 74 along with Articles 124, 217 and
			<lb />
			222, in conjunction with the intent of the framers of the Constitution
			<lb />
			gathered from the Constituent Assembly debates, and the conventions
			<lb />
			adhered to by the political-executive authority in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment and transfer of Judges of the higher judiciary, arrived at the
			<lb />
			conclusion, that &quot;primacy of the judiciary&quot; was a constituent of the
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot; which was a &quot;basic feature&quot; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. Therefore, when a plea is advanced raising a challenge on
			<lb />
			the basis of the violation of the &quot;basic structure&quot; with reference to the
			<lb />
			&quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, its rightful understanding is, and has to
			<lb />
			be, that Articles 12, 36 and 50 on the one hand, and Articles 124, 217
			<lb />
			and 222 on the other, (read collectively and harmoniously) constitute the
			<lb />
			basis thereof. Clearly, the &quot;basic structure&quot; is truly a set of fundamental
			<lb />
			foundational principles, drawn from the provisions of the Constitution
			<lb />
			itself. These are not fanciful principles carved out by the judiciary, at its
			<lb />
			own. Therefore, if the conclusion drawn is, that the &quot;independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary&quot; has been transgressed, it is to be understood, that
			<lb />
			rule/principle collectively emerging from the above provisions, had been
			<lb />
			breached, or that the above Articles read together, had been
			<lb />
			transgressed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			221. So far as the issue of examining the constitutional validity of an
			<lb />
			ordinary legislative enactment is concerned, all the constitutional
			<lb />
			provisions, on the basis whereof the concerned &quot;basic feature&quot; arises, are
			<lb />
			available. Breach of a single provision of the Constitution, would be
			<lb />
			sufficient to render the legislation, ultra vires the Constitution. In such
			<lb />
			view of the matter, it would be proper to accept a challenge based on
			<lb />
			constitutional validity, to refer to the particular Article(s), singularly or
			<lb />
			collectively, which the legislative enactment violates. And in cases where
			<lb />
			the cumulative effect of a number of Articles of the Constitution is stated
			<lb />
			to have been violated, reference should be made to all the concerned
			<lb />
			Articles, including the preamble, if necessary. The issue is purely
			<lb />
			technical. Yet, if a challenge is raised to an ordinary legislative enactment
			<lb />
			based on the doctrine of &quot;basic structure&quot;, the same cannot be treated to
			<lb />
			suffer from a legal infirmity. That would only be a technical flaw. That is
			<lb />
			how, it will be possible to explain the observations made by this Court, in
			<lb />
			the judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioners.
			<lb />
			Therefore, when a challenge is raised to a legislative enactment based on
			<lb />
			the cumulative effect of a number of Articles of the Constitution, it is not
			<lb />
			always necessary to refer to each of the concerned Articles, when a
			<lb />
			cumulative effect of the said Articles has already been determined, as
			<lb />
			constituting one of the &quot;basic features&quot; of the Constitution. Reference to
			<lb />
			the &quot;basic structure&quot;, while dealing with an ordinary legislation, would
			<lb />
			obviate the necessity of recording the same conclusion, which has
			<lb />
			already been scripted while interpreting the Article(s) under reference,
			<lb />
			harmoniously. We would therefore reiterate, that the &quot;basic structure&quot; of
			<lb />
			the Constitution is inviolable, and as such, the Constitution cannot be
			<lb />
			amended so as to negate any &quot;basic features&quot; thereof, and so also, if a
			<lb />
			challenge is raised to an ordinary legislation based on one of the &quot;basic
			<lb />
			features&quot; of the Constitution, it would be valid to do so. If such a
			<lb />
			challenge is accepted, on the ground of violation of the &quot;basic structure&quot;,
			<lb />
			it would mean that the bunch of Articles of the Constitution (including
			<lb />
			the preamble thereof, wherever relevant), which constitute the particular
			<lb />
			&quot;basic feature&quot;, had been violated. We must however credit the contention
			<lb />
			of the learned Attorney General by accepting, that it would be technically
			<lb />
			sound to refer to the Articles which are violated, when an ordinary
			<lb />
			legislation is sought to be struck down, as being ultra vires the provisions
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. But that would not lead to the inference, that to
			<lb />
			strike down an ordinary legislative enactment, as being violative of the
			<lb />
			&quot;basic structure&quot;, would be wrong. We therefore find no merit in the
			<lb />
			contention advanced by the learned Attorney General, but for the
			<lb />
			technical aspect referred to hereinabove.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			XIII.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			222. Various challenges were raised to the different provisions of the
			<lb />
			NJAC Act. First and foremost, a challenge was raised to the manner of
			<lb />
			selection and appointment of the Chief Justice of India. Section 5(1) of
			<lb />
			the NJAC Act, it was submitted, provides that the NJAC would
			<lb />
			recommend the senior most Judge of the Supreme Court, for being
			<lb />
			appointed as Chief Justice of India, subject to the condition, that he is
			<lb />
			considered &quot;fit&quot; to hold the office. It was contended, that the Parliament
			<lb />
			had been authorized by law to regulate the procedure for the
			<lb />
			appointment of the Chief Justice of India, under Article 124C. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the NJAC should have been allowed to frame regulations,
			<lb />
			with reference to the manner of selection and appointment of Judges to
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary including the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			223. It was submitted, that the term &quot;fit&quot;, expressed in Section 5(1) of
			<lb />
			the NJAC Act, had not been elaborately described. And as such, fitness
			<lb />
			would be determined on the subjective satisfaction of the Members of the
			<lb />
			NJAC. It was acknowledged, that even though the learned Attorney
			<lb />
			General had expressed, during the course of hearing, that fitness only
			<lb />
			meant &quot;…mental and physical fitness…&quot;, a successor Attorney General
			<lb />
			may view the matter differently, just as the incumbent Attorney General
			<lb />
			has differed with the concession recorded on behalf of his predecessor (in
			<lb />
			the Third Judges case), even though they both represent the same ruling
			<lb />
			political party. And, it was always open to the Parliament to purposefully
			<lb />
			define the term &quot;fit&quot;, in a manner which could sub-serve the will of the
			<lb />
			executive. It was pointed out, that even an ordinance could be issued
			<lb />
			without the necessity, of following the procedure of enacting law, to bring
			<lb />
			in a person of the choice of the political-executive. It was contended, that
			<lb />
			the criterion of fitness could be defined or redefined, as per the sweet will
			<lb />
			of the non-judicial authorities.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			224. It was pointed out, that there was a constitutional convention,
			<lb />
			whereunder the senior most Judge of the Supreme Court, has always
			<lb />
			been appointed as Chief Justice of India. And that, the aforesaid
			<lb />
			convention had remained unbroken, even though in some cases the
			<lb />
			tenure of the appointee had been extremely short, and may not have
			<lb />
			enured to the advantage of the judiciary, as an institution. Experience
			<lb />
			had shown, according to learned counsel, that adhering to the practice of
			<lb />
			appointing the senior most Judge as the Chief Justice of India, had
			<lb />
			resulted in institutional harmony and collegiality amongst Judges, which
			<lb />
			was extremely important for the health of the judiciary, and also, for the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary. It was submitted, that it would be just
			<lb />
			and appropriate, at the present juncture, to understand the width of the
			<lb />
			power, so as to prevent any likelihood of its misuse in future.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			225. It was suggested, that various ways and means could be devised to
			<lb />
			supersede senior Judges, to bring in favourites. Past experience had
			<lb />
			shown, that the executive had abused its authority, when it departed
			<lb />
			from the above seniority rule in April 1973, by superseding J.M. Shelat,
			<lb />
			the senior most Judge, and even the next two Judges in the order of
			<lb />
			seniority after him, namely, K.S. Hegde and A.N. Grover, while appointing
			<lb />
			the fourth senior most Judge A.N Ray, as the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
			Again in January 1977 on the retirement of A.N. Ray, CJ., the senior
			<lb />
			most Judge H.R. Khanna, was ignored, and the next senior most Judge
			<lb />
			M.H. Beg, was appointed as the Chief Justice of India. Such control in
			<lb />
			the hands of the executive, according to learned counsel, would cause
			<lb />
			immense inroads in the decision making process. And could result in,
			<lb />
			Judges trying to placate and appease the political-executive segment,
			<lb />
			aimed at personal gains and rewards.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			226. The submission noticed above, was sought to be illustrated through
			<lb />
			the following instance. It was contended, that it would be genuine and
			<lb />
			legitimate, for the Parliament to enact by law, that a person would be
			<lb />
			considered &quot;fit&quot; for appointment as Chief Justice of India, only if he had a
			<lb />
			minimum left over tenure of two years. Such an enactment would have a
			<lb />
			devastating effect, even though it would appear to be innocuously
			<lb />
			legitimate. It was pointed out, that out of the 41 Chief Justices of India
			<lb />
			appointed till date, only 12 Chief Justices of India had a tenure of more
			<lb />
			than two years. If such action, as has been illustrated above, was to be
			<lb />
			taken at the hands of the Parliament, it was bound to cause discontent to
			<lb />
			those who had a legitimate expectation to hold the office of Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India, under the seniority rule, which had been in place for all this
			<lb />
			while.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			227. It was asserted, that the illustration portrayed in the foregoing
			<lb />
			paragraph, could be dimensionally altered, by prescribing different
			<lb />
			parameters, tailor-made for accommodating a favoured individual. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the Parliament should never be allowed the right to
			<lb />
			create uncertainty, in the matter of selection and appointment of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India, as the office of the Chief Justice of India was
			<lb />
			pivotal, and shouldered extremely onerous responsibilities. The exercise
			<lb />
			of the above authority by the Parliament, it was pointed out, could/would
			<lb />
			seriously affect the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			228. In the above context, reference was also made, to the opinion
			<lb />
			expressed by renowned persons, having vast experience in judicial
			<lb />
			institutions, effectively bringing out the veracity of the contention
			<lb />
			advanced. Reference in this regard was made to the observations of M.C.
			<lb />
			Chagla, in his book, &quot;Roses in December -An Autobiography&quot;, wherein
			<lb />
			he described the impact of supersession on Judges, who by virtue of the
			<lb />
			existing convention, were in line to be the Chief Justice of India, but were
			<lb />
			overlooked by preferring a junior. The position was expressed thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			The effect of these supersessions was most deleterious on the judges of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court who were in the line of succession to the Chief
			<lb />
			Justiceship. Each eyed the other with suspicion and tried to outdo him
			<lb />
			in proclaiming his loyalty to the Government either in their judgments or
			<lb />
			even on public platforms. If a judge owes his promotion to the favour of
			<lb />
			Government and not to his own intrinsic merit, then the independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary is inevitably lost.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			H.R. Khanna, J., (in his book -&quot;Neither Roses Nor Thorns&quot;) expressed the
			<lb />
			position as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;A couple of days before the pronouncement of judgment the atmosphere
			<lb />
			of tension got aggravated because all kinds of rumours started circulating
			<lb />
			and the name of the successor of the Chief Justice was not being
			<lb />
			announced. The announcement came on the radio after the judgment
			<lb />
			was pronounced and it resulted in the supersession of the three senior
			<lb />
			judges.
			<lb />
			I felt extremely perturbed because in my opinion it was bound to generate
			<lb />
			fear complex or hopes of reward and thus undermine the independence
			<lb />
			of the judiciary. Immediately on hearing the news I went to the residence
			<lb />
			of Justice Hegde. I found him somewhat tense, as anyone in that
			<lb />
			situation would be, but he was otherwise calm. He told me that he, as
			<lb />
			well as Justice Shelat and Justice Grover who had been superseded,
			<lb />
			were tendering their resignations.
			<lb />
			After the resignation of Shelat, Hegde and Grover, the court acquired a
			<lb />
			new complexion and I found perceptible change in the atmosphere.
			<lb />
			Many things happened which made one unhappy and I thought the best
			<lb />
			course was to get engrossed in the disposal of judicial work. The judicial
			<lb />
			work had always an appeal for me and I found the exclusive attention
			<lb />
			paid to it to be rewarding as well as absorbing.
			<lb />
			One of the new trends was the change in the approach of the court with a
			<lb />
			view to give tilt in favour of upholding the orders of the government.
			<lb />
			Under the cover of highsounding words like social justice the court
			<lb />
			passed orders, the effect of which was to unsettle settled principles and
			<lb />
			dilute or undo the dicta laid down in the earlier cases.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			In this behalf, reference was also made to the observations of H.M.
			<lb />
			Seervai (in &quot;Constitutional Law of India -A Critical Commentary&quot;), which
			<lb />
			are as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;In Sankalchand Sheth&apos;s Case, Bhagwati J. after explaining why the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India had to be consulted before a judge could be
			<lb />
			transferred to the High Court of another State, said: &quot;I think it was Mr.
			<lb />
			Justice Jackson who said &apos;Judges are more often bribed by their
			<lb />
			ambition and loyalty rather than by money&apos;… In my submission in
			<lb />
			quoting the above passage Bhagwati J. failed to realize that his only
			<lb />
			loyalty was to himself for, as will appear later, he was disloyal, inter alia,
			<lb />
			to his Chief, Chandrachud C.J. in order to fulfil his own ambition to be
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India as soon as possible. That Bhagwati J. was
			<lb />
			bribed by that ambition will be clear when I deal with his treatment in
			<lb />
			the Judges&apos; Case of Chief Justice Chandrachud&apos;s part in the case of
			<lb />
			Justice Kumar and Singh C.J. It will interest the reader to know that the
			<lb />
			word &quot;ambition&quot; is derived from &quot;ambit, canvass for votes.&quot;,... Whether
			<lb />
			Bhagwati J. canvassed the votes of one or more of his brother judges that
			<lb />
			they should disbelieve Chief Justice Chandrachud&apos;s affidavit in reply to
			<lb />
			the affidavit of Singh C.J. is not known; but had he succeeded in
			<lb />
			persuading one or more of his brother judges to disbelieve that affidavit,
			<lb />
			Chandrachud C.J. would have resigned,and Justice Bhagwati&apos;s ambition
			<lb />
			to be the next Chief Justice of India, would, in all probability, have been
			<lb />
			realised. However, his attempt to blacken the character and conduct of
			<lb />
			Chandrachud C.J. proved futile because 4 of his brother judges accepted
			<lb />
			and acted upon the Chief Justice&apos;s affidavit and held that the transfer of
			<lb />
			Singh C.J. to Madras was valid.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			229. It was submitted, that leaving the issue of determination of fitness,
			<lb />
			with the Parliament, was liable to fan ambitions of Judges, and was likely
			<lb />
			to make the Judges loyal, to those who could satisfy their ambitions. It
			<lb />
			was therefore emphasized, that Section 5(1), which created an ambiguity,
			<lb />
			in the matter of appointment to the office of Chief Justice of India, had
			<lb />
			the trappings of being abused to imperil &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;,
			<lb />
			and therefore, could not be permitted to remain on the statute-book,
			<lb />
			irrespective of the assurance of the Attorney General, that for the
			<lb />
			purpose in hand, the term &quot;fit&quot; meant &quot;… mental and physical fitness…&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			230. It was also contended, that while recommending names for
			<lb />
			appointment of a Judge to the Supreme Court, the concerned Judges&apos;
			<lb />
			seniority in the cadre of Judges (of High Courts), was liable to be taken as
			<lb />
			the primary consideration, coupled with his ability and merit. It was
			<lb />
			submitted, that the instant mandate contained in the first proviso under
			<lb />
			Section 5(2) of the NJAC Act, clearly breached the convention of regional
			<lb />
			representation in the Supreme Court. Since the &quot;federal character&quot;, of
			<lb />
			distribution of powers, was also one of the recognized &quot;basic structures&quot;,
			<lb />
			it was submitted, that regional representation could not have been
			<lb />
			overlooked.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			231. Besides the above, the Court&apos;s attention was invited to the second
			<lb />
			proviso under Section 5(2), which forbids the NJAC from making a
			<lb />
			favourable recommendation, if any two Members thereof, opposed the
			<lb />
			nomination of a candidate. It was contended, that placing the power of
			<lb />
			veto, in the hands of two Members of the NJAC, would violate the
			<lb />
			recommendatory power expressed in Article 124B. In this behalf, it was
			<lb />
			contended, that the above position would entitle two &quot;eminent
			<lb />
			persons&quot;-lay persons (if the submission advanced by the learned Attorney
			<lb />
			General is to be accepted), to defeat a unanimous recommendation of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India and the two senior most Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court. And would also, negate the primacy vested in the judiciary, in the
			<lb />
			matter of appointment of Judges, to the higher judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			232. It was submitted, that the above power of veto exercisable by two
			<lb />
			lay persons, or alternatively one lay person, in conjunction with the
			<lb />
			Union Minister in charge of Law and Justice, would cause serious
			<lb />
			inroads into the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. Most importantly, it
			<lb />
			was contended, that neither the impugned constitutional amendment,
			<lb />
			nor the provisions of the NJAC Act, provided for any quorum for holding
			<lb />
			meetings of the NJAC. And as such, quite contrary to the contentions
			<lb />
			advanced at the hands of the learned Attorney General, a meeting of the
			<lb />
			NJAC could not be held, without the presence of the all Members of the
			<lb />
			NJAC. In order to support his above contention, he illustratively placed
			<lb />
			reliance on the Constitution (122nd Amendment) Bill, 2014 (brought
			<lb />
			before the Parliament, by the same ruling political party, which had
			<lb />
			amended the Constitution, by tabling the Constitution (121st
			<lb />
			Amendment) Bill, 2014. The objective sought to be achieved under the
			<lb />
			above Bill was, to insert a new Article 279A. The new Article 279A
			<lb />
			created the Goods and Services Tax Council. Sub-Article (7) of Article
			<lb />
			279A postulates, that &quot;… One-half of the total number of Members of the
			<lb />
			Goods and Services Tax Council…&quot; would constitute the quorum for its
			<lb />
			meetings. And furthermore, that &quot;… Every decision of the Goods and
			<lb />
			Services Tax Council would be taken at a meeting, by a majority of not
			<lb />
			less than three-fourths of the weighted votes of the members present and
			<lb />
			voting …&quot;. Having laid down the above parameters, in the Bill which
			<lb />
			followed the Bill, that led to the promulgation of the impugned
			<lb />
			Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, it was submitted, that the omission
			<lb />
			of a quorum for the functioning of the NJAC, and the omission of
			<lb />
			quantifying the strength required for valid decision making, vitiated the
			<lb />
			provision itself.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			233. The contention advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for
			<lb />
			the petitioners, as has been noticed in the foregoing paragraph, does not
			<lb />
			require any detailed examination, as the existing declared legal position,
			<lb />
			is clear and unambiguous. In this behalf, it may be recorded, that in
			<lb />
			case a statutory provision vests a decision making authority in a body of
			<lb />
			persons without stipulating the minimum quorum, then a valid meeting
			<lb />
			can be held only if the majority of all the members of the body, deliberate
			<lb />
			in the process of decision making. On the same analogy therefore, a valid
			<lb />
			decision by such a body will necessitate a decision by a simple majority
			<lb />
			of all the members of the body. If the aforesaid principles are made
			<lb />
			applicable to the NJAC, the natural outcome would be, that a valid
			<lb />
			meeting of the NJAC must have at least four Members participating in a
			<lb />
			six-Member NJAC. Likewise, a valid decision of the NJAC can only be
			<lb />
			taken (in the absence of any prescribed prerequisite), by a simple
			<lb />
			majority, namely, by at least four Members of the NJAC (three Members
			<lb />
			on either side, would not make up the simple majority). We are satisfied,
			<lb />
			that the provisions of the NJAC Act which mandate, that the NJAC would
			<lb />
			not make a recommendation in favour of a person for appointment as a
			<lb />
			Judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court, if any two Members
			<lb />
			thereof did not agree with such recommendation, cannot be considered to
			<lb />
			be in violation of the rule/principle expressed above. As a matter of fact,
			<lb />
			the NJAC Act expressly provides, that if any two Members thereof did not
			<lb />
			agree to any particular proposal, the NJAC would not make a
			<lb />
			recommendation. There is nothing in law, to consider or treat the
			<lb />
			aforesaid stipulations in the second proviso to Section 5(2) and Section
			<lb />
			6(6) of the NJAC Act, as unacceptable. The instant submission advanced
			<lb />
			at the hands of the learned counsel for the petitioners is therefore liable
			<lb />
			to be rejected, and is accordingly rejected.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			234. We have also given our thoughtful consideration to the other
			<lb />
			contentions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			petitioners, with reference to Section 5 of the NJAC Act. We are of the
			<lb />
			view, that it was not within the realm of Parliament, to subject the
			<lb />
			process of selection of Judges to the Supreme Court, as well as, to the
			<lb />
			position of Chief Justice of India, in uncertain and ambiguous terms. It
			<lb />
			was imperative to express, the clear parameters of the term &quot;fit&quot;, with
			<lb />
			reference to the senior most Judge of the Supreme Court under Section 5
			<lb />
			of the NJAC Act. We are satisfied, that the term &quot;fit&quot; can be tailor-made,
			<lb />
			to choose a candidate far below in the seniority list. This has been
			<lb />
			adequately demonstrated by the learned counsel for the petitioners.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			235. The clear stance adopted by the learned Attorney General, that the
			<lb />
			term &quot;fit&quot; expressed in Section 5(1) of the NJAC Act, had been accepted
			<lb />
			by the Government, to mean and include, only &quot;…mental and physical
			<lb />
			fitness…&quot;, to discharge the onerous responsibilities of the office of Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, and nothing more. Such a statement cannot, and does
			<lb />
			not, bind successor Governments or the posterity for all times to come.
			<lb />
			The present wisdom, cannot bind future generations. And, it was exactly
			<lb />
			for this reason, that the respondents could resile from the statement
			<lb />
			made by the then Attorney General, before the Bench hearing the Third
			<lb />
			Judges case, that the Union of India was not seeking a review or
			<lb />
			reconsideration of the judgment in the Second Judges case (that, it had
			<lb />
			accepted to treat as binding, the decision in the Second Judges case).
			<lb />
			And yet, during the course of hearing of the present case, the Union of
			<lb />
			India did seek a reconsideration of the Second Judges case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			236. Insofar as the challenge to Section 5(1) of the NJAC Act is
			<lb />
			concerned, we are satisfied to affirm and crystalise the position adopted
			<lb />
			by the Attorney General, namely, that the term &quot;fit&quot; used in Section 5(1)
			<lb />
			would be read to mean only &quot;… mental and physical fitness …&quot;. If that is
			<lb />
			done, it would be legal and constitutional. However, if the position
			<lb />
			adopted breached the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, in the manner
			<lb />
			suggested by the learned counsel for the petitioners, the same would be
			<lb />
			assailable in law.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			237. We will now endeavour, to address the second submission with
			<lb />
			reference to Section 5 of the NJAC Act. Undoubtedly, postulating
			<lb />
			&quot;seniority&quot; in the first proviso under Section 5(2) of the NJAC Act, is a
			<lb />
			laudable objective. And if seniority is to be supplemented and enmeshed
			<lb />
			with &quot;ability and merit&quot;, the most ideal approach, can be seen to have
			<lb />
			been adopted. But what appears on paper, may sometimes not be
			<lb />
			correct in practice. Experience shows, that Judges to every High Court
			<lb />
			are appointed in batches, each batch may have just two or three
			<lb />
			appointees, or may sometimes have even ten or more individuals. A
			<lb />
			group of Judges appointed to one High Court, will be separated from the
			<lb />
			lot of Judges appointed to another High Court, by just a few days, or by
			<lb />
			just a few weeks, and sometimes by just a few months. In the all India
			<lb />
			seniority of Judges, the complete batch appointed on the same day, to
			<lb />
			one High Court, will be placed in a running serial order (in seniority)
			<lb />
			above the other Judges appointed to another High Court, just after a few
			<lb />
			days or weeks or months. Judges appointed later, will have to be placed
			<lb />
			en masse below the earlier batch, in seniority. If appointment of Judges
			<lb />
			to the Supreme Court, is to be made on the basis of seniority (as a
			<lb />
			primary consideration), then the earlier batch would have priority in the
			<lb />
			matter of elevation to the Supreme Court. And hypothetically, if the batch
			<lb />
			had ten Judges (appointed together to a particular High Court), and if all
			<lb />
			of them have proved themselves able and meritorious as High Court
			<lb />
			Judges, they will have to be appointed one after the other, when
			<lb />
			vacancies of Judges arise in the Supreme Court. In that view of the
			<lb />
			matter, Judges from the same High Court would be appointed to the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court, till the entire batch is exhausted. Judges from the same
			<lb />
			High Court, in the above situation where the batch comprised of ten
			<lb />
			Judges, will occupy a third of the total Judge positions in the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court. That would be clearly unacceptable, for the reasons indicated by
			<lb />
			the learned counsel for the petitioners. We also find the position,
			<lb />
			unacceptable in law.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			238. Therefore, insofar as Section 5(2) of the NJAC Act is concerned,
			<lb />
			there cannot be any doubt, that consideration of Judges on the basis of
			<lb />
			their seniority, by treating the same as a primary consideration, would
			<lb />
			adversely affect the present convention of ensuring representation from
			<lb />
			as many State High Courts, as is possible. The convention in vogue is, to
			<lb />
			maintain regional representation. For the reasons recorded above, the
			<lb />
			first proviso under Section 5(2) is liable to be struck down and set aside.
			<lb />
			Section 6(1) applies to appointment of a Judge of a High Court as Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of a High Court. It has the same seniority connotation as has
			<lb />
			been expressed hereinabove, with reference to the first proviso under
			<lb />
			Section 5(2). For exactly the same reasons as have been noticed above,
			<lb />
			based on seniority (as a primary consideration), ten High Courts in
			<lb />
			different States could have Chief Justices drawn from one parent High
			<lb />
			Court. Section 6(1) of the NJAC Act was therefore liable to meet the same
			<lb />
			fate, as the first proviso under Section 5(2).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			239. We are also of the considered view, that the power of veto vested in
			<lb />
			any two Members of the NJAC, would adversely impact primacy of the
			<lb />
			judiciary, in the matter of selection and appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary (as also their transfer). Details in this behalf have
			<lb />
			already been recorded in part VIII hereinabove. Section 6(6) of the NJAC
			<lb />
			Act, has the same connotation as the second proviso under Section 5(2),
			<lb />
			and Section 6(6) of the NJAC Act would therefore meet the same fate, as
			<lb />
			Section 5(2). For the reasons recorded hereinabove, we are satisfied, that
			<lb />
			Sections 5(2) and 6(6) of the NJAC Act also breach the &quot;basic structure&quot;
			<lb />
			of the Constitution, with reference to the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;
			<lb />
			and the &quot;separation of powers&quot;. Sections 5(2) and 6(6), in our considered
			<lb />
			view, are therefore, also liable to be declared as ultra vires the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			240. A challenge was also raised by the learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			petitioners to Section 7 of the NJAC Act. It was asserted, that on the
			<lb />
			recommendation made by the NJAC, the President was obliged to appoint
			<lb />
			the individual recommended as a Judge of the High Court under Article
			<lb />
			217(1). It was submitted, that the above position was identical to the
			<lb />
			position contemplated under Article 124(2), which also provides, that a
			<lb />
			candidate recommended by the NJAC would be appointed by the
			<lb />
			President, as a Judge of the Supreme Court. It was submitted, that
			<lb />
			neither Article 124(2) nor Article 217(1) postulate, that the President
			<lb />
			could require the NJAC to reconsider, the recommendation made by the
			<lb />
			NJAC, as has been provided for under the first proviso to Section 7 of the
			<lb />
			NJAC Act. It was accordingly the contention of the learned counsel for
			<lb />
			the petitioners, that the first proviso to Section 7 was ultra vires the
			<lb />
			provisions of Articles 124(2) and 217(1), by providing for reconsideration,
			<lb />
			and that, the same was beyond the pale and scope of the provisions
			<lb />
			referred to above.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			241. Having considered the submission advanced by the learned counsel
			<lb />
			for the petitioners in the foregoing paragraph, it is not possible for us to
			<lb />
			accept that Section 7 of the NJAC Act, by providing that the President
			<lb />
			could require the NJAC to reconsider a recommendation made by it,
			<lb />
			would in any manner violate Articles 124(2) and 217(1) (which mandate,
			<lb />
			that Judges would be appointed by the President on the recommendation
			<lb />
			of the NJAC). It would be improper to infer, that the action of the
			<lb />
			President, requiring the NJAC to reconsider its proposal, amounted to
			<lb />
			rejecting the proposal made by the NJAC. For, if the NJAC was to
			<lb />
			reiterate the proposal made earlier, the President even in terms of Section
			<lb />
			7, was bound to act in consonance therewith (as is apparent from the
			<lb />
			second proviso under Section 7 of the NJAC Act). In our considered view,
			<lb />
			the instant submission advanced at the hands of the petitioners deserves
			<lb />
			to be rejected, and is accordingly rejected.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			242. Learned counsel for the petitioners had also assailed the validity of
			<lb />
			Section 8 of the NJAC Act, which provides for the Secretary to the
			<lb />
			Government of India, in the Department of Justice, to be the convener of
			<lb />
			the NJAC. It was contended, that the function of a convener, with
			<lb />
			reference to the NJAC, would entail the responsibility of inter alia
			<lb />
			preparing the agenda for the meetings of the NJAC, namely, to decide the
			<lb />
			names of the individuals to be taken up for consideration, in the next
			<lb />
			meeting. This would also include, the decision to ignore names from
			<lb />
			being taken up for consideration in the next meeting. He may include or
			<lb />
			exclude names from consideration, at the behest of his superior. It would
			<lb />
			also be the responsibility of the convener, to compile data made available
			<lb />
			from various quarters, as contemplated under the NJAC Act, and in
			<lb />
			addition thereto, as may be required by the Union Minister in charge of
			<lb />
			Law and Justice, and the Chief Justice of India. It was submitted, that
			<lb />
			such an onerous responsibility, could not be left to the executive alone,
			<lb />
			because material could be selectively placed by the convener before the
			<lb />
			NJAC, in deference to the desire of his superior -the Union Minister in
			<lb />
			charge of Law and Justice, by excluding favourable material, with
			<lb />
			reference to a candidate considered unsuitable by the executive, and by
			<lb />
			excluding unfavourable material, with reference to a candidate who
			<lb />
			carried favour with the executive.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			243. It was additionally submitted, that it was imperative to exclude all
			<lb />
			executive participation in the proceedings of the NJAC for two reasons.
			<lb />
			Firstly, the executive was the largest individual litigant, in matters
			<lb />
			pending before the higher judiciary, and therefore, cannot have any
			<lb />
			discretionary role in the process of selection and appointment of Judges
			<lb />
			to the higher judiciary (in the manner expressed in the preceding
			<lb />
			paragraph). And secondly, the same would undermine the concepts of
			<lb />
			&quot;separation of powers&quot; and &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, whereunder
			<lb />
			the judiciary has to be shielded from any possible interference, either
			<lb />
			from the executive or the legislature.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			244. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the above two
			<lb />
			submissions, dealt with in the preceding two paragraphs. We have
			<lb />
			already concluded earlier, that the participation of the Union Minister in
			<lb />
			charge of Law and Justice, as a Member of the NJAC, as contemplated
			<lb />
			under Article 124A(1), in the matter of appointment of Judges to the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, would breach the concepts of &quot;separation of powers&quot; and
			<lb />
			the &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, which are both undisputedly
			<lb />
			components of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution of India. For
			<lb />
			exactly the same reasons, we are of the view, that Section 8 of the NJAC
			<lb />
			Act which provides, that the Secretary to the Government of India, in the
			<lb />
			Department of Justice, would be the convener of the NJAC, is not
			<lb />
			sustainable in law.
			<lb />
			In a body like the NJAC, the administrative
			<lb />
			functioning cannot be under executive or legislative control. The only
			<lb />
			remaining alternative, is to vest the administrative control of such a
			<lb />
			body, with the judiciary. For the above reasons, Section 8 of the NJAC
			<lb />
			Act would likewise be unsustainable in law.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			245. Examined from the legal perspective, it was unnecessary for us to
			<lb />
			examine the individual provisions of the NJAC Act. Once the
			<lb />
			constitutional validity of Article 124A(1) is held to be unsustainable, the
			<lb />
			impugned constitutional amendment, as well as, the NJAC Act, would be
			<lb />
			rendered a nullity. The necessity of dealing with some of the issues was
			<lb />
			prompted by the consideration, that broad parameters should be
			<lb />
			expressed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			V.
			<lb />
			THE
			<lb />
			EFFECT
			<lb />
			OF
			<lb />
			STRIKING
			<lb />
			DOWN
			<lb />
			THE
			<lb />
			IMPUGNED
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			246. Would the amended provisions of the Constitution revive, if the
			<lb />
			impugned constitutional amendment was to be set aside, as being
			<lb />
			violative of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution? It would be relevant
			<lb />
			to mention, that the instant issue was not adverted to by the learned
			<lb />
			counsel for the petitioners, possibly on the assumption, that if on a
			<lb />
			consideration of the present controversy, this Court would strike down
			<lb />
			the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, then Articles 124, 127, 128,
			<lb />
			217, 222, 224, 224A and 231, as they existed prior to the impugned
			<lb />
			amendment, would revive. And on such revival, the judgments rendered
			<lb />
			in the Second and Third Judges cases, would again regulate selections
			<lb />
			and appointments, as also, transfer of Judges of the higher judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			247. A serious objection to the aforesaid assumption, was raised on
			<lb />
			behalf of the respondents by the Solicitor General, who contended, that
			<lb />
			the striking down of the impugned constitutional amendment, would not
			<lb />
			result in the revival of the provisions, which had been amended by the
			<lb />
			Parliament. In order to canvass the aforesaid proposition, reliance was
			<lb />
			placed on Article 367, which postulates, that the provisions of the
			<lb />
			General Clauses Act, 1897 had to be applied, for an interpretation of the
			<lb />
			Articles of the Constitution, in the same manner, as the provisions of the
			<lb />
			General Clauses Act, are applicable for an interpretation of ordinary
			<lb />
			legislation. Insofar as the instant submission is concerned, we have no
			<lb />
			hesitation in affirming, that unless the context requires otherwise, the
			<lb />
			provisions of the General Clauses Act, can be applied, for a rightful and
			<lb />
			effective understanding of the provisions of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			248. Founded on the submission noticed in the foregoing paragraph, the
			<lb />
			Solicitor General placed reliance on Sections 6, 7 and 8 of the General
			<lb />
			Clauses Act, which are being extracted hereunder:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;6. Effect of repeal.-Where this Act, or any Central Act or Regulation
			<lb />
			made after the commencement of this Act, repeals any enactment
			<lb />
			hitherto made or hereafter to be made, then, unless a different intention
			<lb />
			appears, the repeal shall not--
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(a) revive anything not in force or existing at the time at which the repeal
			<lb />
			takes effect; or
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(b) affect the previous operation of any enactment so repealed or anything
			<lb />
			duly done or suffered thereunder; or
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or
			<lb />
			incurred under any enactment so repealed; or
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(d) affect any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any
			<lb />
			offence committed against any enactment so repealed; or
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(e) affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any
			<lb />
			such right, privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or
			<lb />
			punishment as aforesaid;
			<lb />
			and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be
			<lb />
			instituted, continued or enforced, and any such penalty, forfeiture or
			<lb />
			punishment may be imposed as if the repealing Act or Regulation had not
			<lb />
			been passed.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			7. Revival of repealed enactments.-(1) In any Central Act or Regulation
			<lb />
			made after the commencement of this Act, it shall be necessary, for the
			<lb />
			purpose of reviving, either wholly or partially, any enactment wholly or
			<lb />
			partially repealed, expressly to state that purpose.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2) This section applies also to all Central Acts made after the third day of
			<lb />
			January, 1868, and to all Regulations made on or after the fourteenth
			<lb />
			day of January, 1887.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			8. Construction of references to repealed enactments.-(1) Where this Act,
			<lb />
			or any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of this
			<lb />
			Act, repeals and re-enacts, with or without modification, any provision of
			<lb />
			a former enactment, then references in any other enactment or in any
			<lb />
			instrument to the provision so repealed shall, unless a different intention
			<lb />
			appears, be construed as references to the provision so re-enacted.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2) Where before the fifteenth day of August, 1947, any Act of Parliament
			<lb />
			of the United Kingdom repealed and re-enacted, with or without
			<lb />
			modification, any provision of a former enactment, then reference in any
			<lb />
			Central Act or in any Regulation or instrument to the provision so
			<lb />
			repealed shall, unless a different intention appears, be construed as
			<lb />
			references to the provision so re-enacted.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			249. Relying on Section 6, it was submitted, that the setting aside of the
			<lb />
			impugned constitutional amendment, should be considered as setting
			<lb />
			aside of a repealing provision. And as such, the acceptance of the claim
			<lb />
			of the petitioners, would not lead to the automatic revival of the
			<lb />
			provisions as they existed prior to the amendment. Relying on Section 7
			<lb />
			it was asserted, that if a repealed provision had to be revived, it was
			<lb />
			imperative for the legislature to express such intendment, and unless so
			<lb />
			expressly indicated, the enactment wholly or partly repealed, would not
			<lb />
			stand revived. Finally relying on Section 8 of the General Clauses Act, it
			<lb />
			was submitted, that when an existing provision was repealed and
			<lb />
			another provision was re-enacted as its replacement, no further reference
			<lb />
			could be made to the repealed enactment, and for all intents and
			<lb />
			purposes, reference must mandatorily be made, only to the re-enacted
			<lb />
			provision. Relying on the principles underlying Sections 6, 7 and 8, it
			<lb />
			was submitted, that even if the prayers made by the petitioners were to
			<lb />
			be accepted, and the impugned constitutional amendment was to be set
			<lb />
			aside, the same would not result in the revival of the unamended
			<lb />
			provisions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			250. Learned Solicitor General also referred to a number of judgments
			<lb />
			rendered by this Court, to support the inference drawn by him. We shall
			<lb />
			therefore, in the first instance, examine the judgments relied upon:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Reliance in the first instance was placed on the Ameer-un-Nissa
			<lb />
			Begum case 70 . Our pointed attention was drawn to the observations
			<lb />
			recorded in paragraph 24 thereof, which is reproduced hereunder:
			<lb />
			&quot;24 The result will be the same even if we proceed on the footing that the
			<lb />
			various &apos;Firmans&apos; issued by the Nizam were in the nature of legislative
			<lb />
			enactments determining private rights somewhat on the analogy of
			<lb />
			private Acts of Parliament. We may assume that the &apos;Firman&apos; of
			<lb />
			26-6-1947 was repealed by the &apos;Firman&apos; of 24-2-1949, and the latter
			<lb />
			&apos;Firman&apos; in its turn was repealed by that of 7-9-1949. Under the English
			<lb />
			Common Law when a repealing enactment was repealed by another
			<lb />
			statute, the repeal of the second Act revived the former Act &apos;ab initio&apos;. But
			<lb />
			this rule does not apply to repealing Acts passed since 1850 and now if
			<lb />
			an Act repealing a former Act is itself repealed, the last repeal does not
			<lb />
			revive the Act before repealed unless words are added reviving it: vide
			<lb />
			Maxwell&apos;s Interpretation of Statutes, p. 402 (10th Edition).
			<lb />
			It may indeed be said that the present rule is the result of the statutory
			<lb />
			provisions introduced by the Interpretation Act of 1889 and as we are not
			<lb />
			bound by the provisions of any English statute, we can still apply the
			<lb />
			English Common Law rule if it appears to us to be reasonable and
			<lb />
			proper. But even according to the Common Law doctrine, the repeal of
			<lb />
			the repealing enactment would not revive the original Act if the second
			<lb />
			repealing enactment manifests an intention to the contrary….&quot;
			<lb />
			Having given our thoughtful consideration to the conclusions recorded in
			<lb />
			the judgment relied upon, we are satisfied, that the same does not
			<lb />
			support the cause of the respondents, because in the judgment relied
			<lb />
			upon, it was clearly concluded, that under the English Common Law
			<lb />
			when a repealing enactment was repealed by another law, the repeal of
			<lb />
			the second enactment would revive the former &quot;ab initio&quot;. In the above
			<lb />
			view of the matter, based exclusively on the English Common Law, on the
			<lb />
			setting aside of the impugned constitutional amendment, the unamended
			<lb />
			provision, would stand revived. It also needs to be noticed, that the final
			<lb />
			position to the contrary, expressed in the judgment relied upon, emerged
			<lb />
			as a consequence of subsequent legislative enactment, made in England,
			<lb />
			which is inapplicable to India. Having taken the above subsequent
			<lb />
			amendments into consideration, it was concluded, that the repeal of the
			<lb />
			repealing enactment would not revive the original enactment, except &quot;… if
			<lb />
			the second repealing enactment manifests an intention to the contrary.
			<lb />
			…&quot; In other words, the implication would be, that the original Act would
			<lb />
			revive, but for an intention to the contrary expressed in the repealing
			<lb />
			enactment. It is however needs to be kept in mind, that the above
			<lb />
			judgment, did not deal with an exigency where the provision enacted by
			<lb />
			the legislation had been set aside by a Court order.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			Reliance was then placed on the Firm A.T.B. Mehtab Majid &amp; Co.
			<lb />
			case 71 , and more particularly, the conclusions drawn in paragraph 20
			<lb />
			thereof. A perusal of the above judgment would reveal, that this Court
			<lb />
			had recorded its conclusions, without relying on either the English
			<lb />
			Common Law, or the provisions of the General Clauses Act, which
			<lb />
			constituted the foundation of the contentions advanced at the hands of
			<lb />
			the respondents, before us. We are therefore satisfied, that the
			<lb />
			conclusions drawn in the instant judgment, would not be applicable, to
			<lb />
			arrive at a conclusion one way or the other, insofar as the present
			<lb />
			controversy is concerned.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii) Reference was thereafter made to the B.N. Tewari case 72 , and our
			<lb />
			attention was drawn to the following observations:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;6. We shall first consider the question whether the carry forward rule of
			<lb />
			1952 still exists. It is true that in Devadasan&apos;s case, AIR 1964 SC 179,
			<lb />
			the final order of this Court was in these terms:-
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;In the result the petition succeeds partially and the carry forward rule as
			<lb />
			modified in 1955 is declared invalid.&quot;
			<lb />
			That however does not mean that this Court held that the 1952-rule
			<lb />
			must be deemed to exist because this Court said that the carry forward
			<lb />
			rule as modified in 1955 was declared invalid. The carry forward rule of
			<lb />
			1952 was substituted by the carry forward rule of 1955. On this
			<lb />
			substitution the carry forward rule of 1952 clearly ceased to exist
			<lb />
			because its place was taken by the carry forward rule of 1955. Thus by
			<lb />
			promulgating the new carry forward rule in 1955, the Government of
			<lb />
			India itself cancelled the carry forward rule of 1952. When therefore this
			<lb />
			Court struck down the carry forward rule as modified in 1955 that did
			<lb />
			not mean that the carry forward rule of 1952 which had already ceased
			<lb />
			to exist, because the Government of India itself cancelled it and had
			<lb />
			substituted a modified rule in 1955 in its place, could revive. We are
			<lb />
			therefore of opinion that after the judgment of this Court in Devadasan&apos;s
			<lb />
			case AIR 1964 SC 179 there is no carry forward rule at all, for the carry
			<lb />
			forward rule of 1955 was struck down by this Court while the carry
			<lb />
			forward rule of 1952 had ceased to exist when the Government of India
			<lb />
			substituted the carry forward rule of 1955 in its place. But it must be
			<lb />
			made clear that the judgment of this Court in Devadasan&apos;s case AIR 1964
			<lb />
			SC 179, is only concerned with that part of the instructions of the
			<lb />
			Government of India which deal with the carry forward rule; it does not
			<lb />
			in any way touch the reservation for scheduled castes and scheduled
			<lb />
			tribes at 12-1/2% and 5%, respectively; nor does it touch the filling up of
			<lb />
			schedule tribes vacancies by scheduled caste candidates where sufficient
			<lb />
			number of scheduled tribes are not available in a particular year or vice
			<lb />
			versa. The effect of the judgment in Devadasan&apos;s case, AIR 1964 SC 179,
			<lb />
			therefore is only to strike down the carry forward rule and it does not
			<lb />
			affect the year to year reservation for scheduled castes and scheduled
			<lb />
			tribes or filling up of scheduled tribe vacancies by a member of scheduled
			<lb />
			castes in a particular year if a sufficient number of scheduled tribe
			<lb />
			candidates are not available in that year of vice versa. This adjustment in
			<lb />
			the reservation between scheduled
		</item>
		<p>
			castes and tribes has nothing to do
			<lb />
			with the carry forward rule from year to year either of 1952 which had
			<lb />
			ceased to exist or of 1955 which was struck down by this Court. In this
			<lb />
			view of the matter it is unnecessary to consider whether the carry
			<lb />
			forward rule of 1952 would be unconstitutional, for that rule no longer
			<lb />
			exists.&quot;
			<lb />
			The non-revival of the carry-forward-rule of 1952, which was sought to be
			<lb />
			modified in 1955, determined in the instant judgment, was not on
			<lb />
			account of the submissions, that have been advanced before us in the
			<lb />
			present controversy. But, on account of the fact, that the Government of
			<lb />
			India had itself cancelled the carry-forward-rule of 1952. Moreover, the
			<lb />
			issue under consideration in the above judgment, was not akin to the
			<lb />
			controversy in hand. As such, we are satisfied that reliance on the B.N.
			<lb />
			Tewari case 72 is clearly misplaced.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv) Relying on the Koteswar Vittal Kamath case 73 , learned Solicitor
			<lb />
			General placed reliance on the following observations recorded therein:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;8. On that analogy, it was argued that, if we hold that the Prohibition
			<lb />
			Order of 1950, was invalid, the previous Prohibition Order of 1119,
			<lb />
			cannot be held to be revived. This argument ignores the distinction
			<lb />
			between supersession of a rule, and substitution of a rule. In the case of
			<lb />
			Firm A. T. B. Mehtab Majid &amp; Co. (supra), the new Rule 16 was
			<lb />
			substituted for the old Rule 16. The process of substitution consists of
			<lb />
			two steps. First, the old rule it made to cease to exist and, next, the new
			<lb />
			rule is brought into existence in its place. Even if the new rule be invalid,
			<lb />
			the first step of the old rule ceasing to exist comes into effect, and it was
			<lb />
			for this reason that the court held that, on declaration of the new rule as
			<lb />
			invalid, the old rule could not be held to be revived. In the case before us,
			<lb />
			there was no substitution of the Prohibition Order of 1950, for the
			<lb />
			Prohibition Order of 1119. The Prohibition Order of 1950, was
			<lb />
			promulgated independently of the Prohibition Order of 1119 and because
			<lb />
			of the provisions of law it would have had the effect of making the
			<lb />
			Prohibition Order of 1119 inoperative if it had been a valid Order. If the
			<lb />
			Prohibition Order of 1950 is found to be void ab initio, it could never
			<lb />
			make the Prohibition Order of 1119 inoperative. Consequently, on the
			<lb />
			30th March, 1950, either the Prohibition Order of 1119 or the Prohibition
			<lb />
			Order of 1950 must be held to have been in force in Travancore-Cochin,
			<lb />
			so that the provisions of Section 73(2) of
		</item>
		<p>
			Act 5 of 1950 would apply to
			<lb />
			that Order and would continue it in force. This further continuance after
			<lb />
			Act 5 of 1950, of course, depends on the validity of Section 3 of Act 5 of
			<lb />
			1950, because Section 73(2) purported to continue the Order in force
			<lb />
			under that section, so that we proceed to examine the argument relating
			<lb />
			to the validity of Section 3 of Act 5 of 1950.&quot;
			<lb />
			A perusal of the conclusion drawn hereinabove, apparently supports the
			<lb />
			contention advanced at the hands of the respondents, that if the
			<lb />
			amendment to an erstwhile legislative enactment, envisages the
			<lb />
			substitution of an existing provision, the process of substitution must be
			<lb />
			deemed to comprise of two steps. The first step would envisage, that the
			<lb />
			old rule would cease to exist, and the second step would envisage, that
			<lb />
			the new rule had taken the place of the old rule. And as such, even if the
			<lb />
			new rule was to be declared as invalid, the first step depicted above,
			<lb />
			namely, that the old rule has ceased to exist, would remain unaltered.
			<lb />
			Thereby, leading to the inference, that in the present controversy, even if
			<lb />
			the impugned constitutional amendment was to be set aside, the same
			<lb />
			would not lead to the revival of the unamended Articles 124, 127, 128,
			<lb />
			217, 222, 224, 224A and 231. In our considered view, the observations
			<lb />
			made in the judgment leading to the submissions and inferences
			<lb />
			recorded above, are not applicable to the present case. The highlighted
			<lb />
			portion of the judgment extracted above, would apply to the present
			<lb />
			controversy. In the present case the impugned constitutional amendment
			<lb />
			was promulgated independently of the original provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. In fact, the amended provisions introduce a new scheme of
			<lb />
			selection and appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary, directionally
			<lb />
			different from the prevailing position. And therefore, the original
			<lb />
			provisions of the Constitution would have been made inoperative, only if
			<lb />
			the amended provisions were valid. Consequently, if reliance must be
			<lb />
			placed on the above judgment, the conclusion would be against the
			<lb />
			proposition canvassed. It would however be relevant to mention, that the
			<lb />
			instant judgment, as also, some of the other judgments relied upon by
			<lb />
			the learned counsel for the respondents, have been explained and
			<lb />
			distinguished in the State of Maharashtra v. Central Provinces
			<lb />
			Manganese Ore Co. Ltd. 76 , which will be dealt with chronologically
			<lb />
			hereinafter.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(v)
			<lb />
			The learned Solicitor General then placed reliance on, the
			<lb />
			Mulchand Odhavji case 74 , and invited our attention to the observations
			<lb />
			recorded in paragraph 8 thereof. Reliance was even placed on, the Mohd.
			<lb />
			Shaukat Hussain Khan case 75 , and in particular, the observations
			<lb />
			recorded in paragraph 11 thereof. We are satisfied, that the instant two
			<lb />
			judgments are irrelevant for the determination of the pointed contention,
			<lb />
			advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the respondents, as the
			<lb />
			subject matter of the controversy dealt with in the above cases, was
			<lb />
			totally different from the one in hand.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vi) Reference was then made to the Central Provinces Manganese Ore
			<lb />
			Co. Ltd. case 76 , and our attention was drawn to the following
			<lb />
			observations recorded therein:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;18. We do not think that the word substitution necessarily or always
			<lb />
			connotes two severable steps, that is to say, one of repeal and another of
			<lb />
			a fresh enactment even if it implies two steps. Indeed, the natural
			<lb />
			meaning of the word &quot;substitution&quot; is to indicate that the process cannot
			<lb />
			be split up into two pieces like this. If the process described as
			<lb />
			substitution fails, it is totally ineffective so as to leave intact what was
			<lb />
			sought to be displaced. That seems to us to be the ordinary and natural
			<lb />
			meaning of the words &quot;shall be substituted&quot;. This part could not become
			<lb />
			effective without the assent of the Governor-General. The State
			<lb />
			Governor&apos;s assent was insufficient. It could not be inferred that, what
			<lb />
			was intended was that, in case the substitution failed or proved
			<lb />
			ineffective, some repeal, not mentioned at all, was brought about and
			<lb />
			remained effective so as to create what may be described as a vacuum in
			<lb />
			the statutory law on the subject-matter. Primarily, the question is one of
			<lb />
			gathering, the intent from the use of words in the enacting provision seen
			<lb />
			in the light of the procedure gone through. Here, no intention to repeal,
			<lb />
			without a substitution, is deducible. In other words, there could be no
			<lb />
			repeal if substitution failed. The two were a part and parcel of a single
			<lb />
			indivisible process and not bits of a disjointed operation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19. Looking at the actual procedure which was gone through, we find
			<lb />
			that, even if the Governor had assented to the substitution, yet, the
			<lb />
			amendment would have been effective, as a piece of valid legislation, only
			<lb />
			when the assent of the Governor-General had also been accorded to it. It
			<lb />
			could not be said that what the Legislature intended or what the
			<lb />
			Governor had assented to consisted of a separate repeal and a fresh
			<lb />
			enactment. The two results were to follow from one and the same effective
			<lb />
			Legislative process. The process had, therefore, to be so viewed and
			<lb />
			interpreted.
			<lb />
			20. Some help was sought to be derived by the citation of B.N. Tewari
			<lb />
			v. Union of India [1965]2 SCR 421 and the case of Firm A. T. B. Mehtab
			<lb />
			Majid and Co. v. State of Madras. Tewari&apos;s case related to the
			<lb />
			substitution of what was described as the &quot;carry forward&quot; rule contained
			<lb />
			in the departmental instruction which was sought to be substituted by a
			<lb />
			modified instruction declared invalid by the court. It was held that when
			<lb />
			the rule contained in the modified instruction of 1955 was struck down
			<lb />
			the rule contained in a displaced instruction did not survive. Indeed, one
			<lb />
			of the arguments there was that the original &quot;carry forward&quot; rule of 1952
			<lb />
			was itself void for the very reason for which the &quot;carry forward&quot; rule,
			<lb />
			contained in the modified instructions of 1955, had been struck down.
			<lb />
			Even the analogy of a merger of an order into another which was meant
			<lb />
			to be its substitute could apply only where there is a valid substitution.
			<lb />
			Such a doctrine applies in a case where a judgment of a subordinate
			<lb />
			court merges in the judgment of the appellate court or an order reviewed
			<lb />
			merges in the order by which the review is granted. Its application to a
			<lb />
			legislative process may be possible only in cases of valid substitution.
			<lb />
			The legislative intent and its effect is gathered, inter alia, from the nature
			<lb />
			of the action of the authority which functions. It is easier to impute an
			<lb />
			intention to an executive rule-making authority to repeal altogether in
			<lb />
			any event what is sought to be displaced by another rule. The cases cited
			<lb />
			were of executive instructions. We do not think that they could serve as
			<lb />
			useful guides in interpreting a Legislative provision sought to be
			<lb />
			amended by a fresh enactment. The procedure for enactment is far more
			<lb />
			elaborate and formal. A repeal and a displacement of a Legislative
			<lb />
			provision by a fresh enactment can only take place after that elaborate
			<lb />
			procedure has been followed in toto. In the case of any rule contained in
			<lb />
			an executive instruction, on the other hand, the repeal as well as
			<lb />
			displacement are capable of being achieved and inferred from a bare
			<lb />
			issue of fresh instructions on the same subject.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			21. In Mehtab Majid &amp; Co.&apos;s case a statutory role was held not to have
			<lb />
			revived after it was sought to be substituted by another held to be
			<lb />
			invalid. This was also a case in which no elaborate legislative procedure
			<lb />
			was prescribed for a repeal as it is in the case of statutory enactment of
			<lb />
			statutes by legislatures. In every case, it is a question of intention to be
			<lb />
			gathered from the language as well as the acts of the rule-making or
			<lb />
			legislating authority in the context in which these occur.
			<lb />
			22. A principle of construction contained now in a statutory provision
			<lb />
			made in England since 1850 has been:
			<lb />
			Where an Act passed after 1850 repeals wholly or partially any former
			<lb />
			enactment and substitutes provisions for the enactment repealed, the
			<lb />
			repealed enactment remains in force until the substituted provisions
			<lb />
			come into operation. (See: Halsbury&apos;s Laws of England, Third Edn. Vol.
			<lb />
			36, P. 474; Craies on &quot;Statute Law&quot;, 6th Edn. p.386).
			<lb />
			Although, there is no corresponding provision in our General Clauses
			<lb />
			Acts, yet, it shows that the mere use of words denoting a substitution
			<lb />
			does not ipso facto or automatically repeal a provision until the provision,
			<lb />
			which is to take its place becomes legally effective. We have as explained
			<lb />
			above, reached the same conclusion by considering the ordinary and
			<lb />
			natural meaning of the term &quot;substitution&quot; when it occurs without
			<lb />
			anything else in the language used or in the context of it or in the
			<lb />
			surrounding facts and circumstances to lead to another inference. It
			<lb />
			means, ordinarily, that unless the substituted provision is there to take
			<lb />
			its place, in law and in effect, the pre-existing provision continues. There
			<lb />
			is no question of a &quot;revival&quot;.&quot;
			<lb />
			It would be relevant to mention, that the learned Solicitor General
			<lb />
			conceded, that the position concluded in the instant judgment, would
			<lb />
			defeat the stance adopted by him. We endorse the above view. The
			<lb />
			position which is further detrimental to the contention advanced on
			<lb />
			behalf of the respondents is, that in recording the above conclusions, this
			<lb />
			Court in the above cited case, had taken into consideration, the
			<lb />
			judgments in the Firm A.T.B. Mehtab Majid case 71 , the B.N. Tewari
			<lb />
			case 72 , the Koteswar Vittal Kamath case 73 , and the Mulchand Odhavji
			<lb />
			case 74 . The earlier judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			respondents would, therefore, be clearly inapplicable to the controversy
			<lb />
			in hand. In this view of the matter, there is hardly any substance in the
			<lb />
			pointed issue canvassed on behalf of the respondents.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vii) The learned Solicitor General, then placed reliance on Indian
			<lb />
			Express Newspapers (Bombay) Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India 95 , and invited
			<lb />
			our attention to the following observations recorded therein:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;107. In the cases before us we do not have rules made by two different
			<lb />
			authorities as in Mulchand case (1971) 3 SCC 53 and no intention on the
			<lb />
			part of the Central Government to keep alive the exemption in the event
			<lb />
			of the subsequent notification being struck down is also established. The
			<lb />
			decision of this Court in Koteswar Vittal Kamath v. K. Rangappa Baliga
			<lb />
			and Co. (1969) 3 SCR 40) does not also support the Petitioners. In that
			<lb />
			case again the question was whether a subsequent legislation which was
			<lb />
			passed by a legislature without competence would have the effect of
			<lb />
			reviving an earlier rule which it professed to supersede. This case again
			<lb />
			belongs to the category of Mohd. Shaukat Hussain Khan case, AIR 1974
			<lb />
			SC 1480. It may also be noticed that in Koteswar Vittal Kamath case, AIR
			<lb />
			1969 SC 504, the ruling in the case of Firm A.T.B. Mehtab Majid and Co.
			<lb />
			AIR 1963 SC 928 has been distinguished. The case of State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra v. Central Provinces Manganese Ore Co. Ltd., AIR 1977 SC
			<lb />
			879 is again distinguishable. In this case the whole legislative process
			<lb />
			termed substitution was abortive, because, it did not take effect for want
			<lb />
			of the assent of the Governor-General and the Court distinguished that
			<lb />
			case from Tiwari case, AIR 1965 SC 1430. We may also state that the
			<lb />
			legal effect on an earlier law when the later law enacted in its place is
			<lb />
			declared invalid does not depend merely upon the use of words like,
			<lb />
			&apos;substitution&apos;, or &apos;supersession&apos;. It depends upon the totality of
			<lb />
			circumstances and the context in which they are used.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			What needs to be noticed from the extract reproduced above is, that this
			<lb />
			Court in the above judgment clearly concluded, that the legal effect on an
			<lb />
			earlier law, when the later law enacted in its place was declared invalid,
			<lb />
			did not depend merely upon the use of the words like &apos;substitution&apos; or,
			<lb />
			&apos;supersession&apos;. And further, that it would depend on the totality of the
			<lb />
			circumstances, and the context, in which the provision was couched. If
			<lb />
			the contention advanced by the learned Solicitor General is accepted, it
			<lb />
			would lead to a constitutional breakdown. The tremors of such a
			<lb />
			situation are already being felt. The retiring Judges of the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary, are not being substituted by fresh appointments. The above
			<lb />
			judgment, in our considered view, does not support the submission being
			<lb />
			canvassed, because on consideration of the &quot;…totality of circumstances
			<lb />
			and the context…&quot; the instant contention is just not acceptable. We are
			<lb />
			therefore of the considered view, that even the instant judgment can be of
			<lb />
			no avail to the respondents, insofar as the present controversy is
			<lb />
			concerned.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(viii) Reliance was next placed on the judgment rendered by this Court in
			<lb />
			Bhagat Ram Sharma v. Union of India 96 . The instant judgment was
			<lb />
			relied upon only to show, that an enactment purported to be an
			<lb />
			amendment, has the same qualitative effect as a repeal of the existing
			<lb />
			statutory provision. The aforesaid inference was drawn by placing
			<lb />
			reliance on Southerland&apos;s Statutory Construction, 3 rd Edition, Volume I.
			<lb />
			Since there is no quarrel on the instant proposition, it is not necessary to
			<lb />
			record anything further. It however needs to be noticed, that we are not
			<lb />
			confronted with the effect of an amendment or a repeal. We are dealing
			<lb />
			with the effect of the striking down of a constitutional amendment and a
			<lb />
			legislative enactment, through a process of judicial review.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(ix) Reliance was then placed on State of Rajasthan v. Mangilal
			<lb />
			Pindwal 97 , and particularly on the observations/conclusions recorded in
			<lb />
			paragraph 12 thereof. All that needs to be stated is, that the issue
			<lb />
			decided in the above judgment, does not arise for consideration in the
			<lb />
			present case, and accordingly, the conclusions drawn therein cannot be
			<lb />
			made applicable to the present case.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(x)
			<lb />
			Next in order, reliance was placed on the India Tobacco Co. Ltd.
			<lb />
			case 77 , and our attention was invited to the following observations
			<lb />
			recorded therein:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;15. The general rule of construction is that the repeal of a repealing Act
			<lb />
			does not revive anything repealed thereby. But the operation of this rule
			<lb />
			is not absolute. It is subject to the appearance of a &quot;different intention&quot; in
			<lb />
			the repealing statute. Again, such intention may be explicit or implicit.
			<lb />
			The questions, therefore, that arise for determination are: Whether in
			<lb />
			relation to cigarettes, the 1941 Act was repealed by the 1954 Act and the
			<lb />
			latter by the 1958 Act? Whether the 1954 Act and 1958 Act were
			<lb />
			repealing enactments? Whether there is anything in the 1954 Act and the
			<lb />
			1958 Act indicating a revival of the 1941 Act in relation to cigarettes?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			16. It is now well settled that &quot;repeal&quot; connotes abrogation or obliteration
			<lb />
			of one statute by another, from the statute book as completely &quot;as if it
			<lb />
			had never been passed&quot;; when an Act is repealed, &quot;it must be considered
			<lb />
			(except as to transactions past and closed) as if it had never existed&quot;. (Per
			<lb />
			Tindal, C.J. in Kay v. Goodwin (1830) 6 Bing 576, 582 and Lord
			<lb />
			Tenterdon in Surtees v. Ellison (1829) 9 B&amp;C 750, 752 cited with
			<lb />
			approval in State of Orissa v. M.A. Tulloch &amp; Co., AIR 1964 SC 1284).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			17. Repeal is not a matter of mere from but one of substance, depending
			<lb />
			upon the intention of the Legislature. If the intention, indicated expressly
			<lb />
			or by necessary implication in the subsequent statute, was to abrogate or
			<lb />
			wipe off the former enactment, wholly or in part, then it would be a case
			<lb />
			of total or pro tanto repeal. If the intention was merely to modify the
			<lb />
			former enactment by engrafting an exception or granting an exemption,
			<lb />
			or by super-adding conditions, or by restricting, intercepting or
			<lb />
			suspending its operation, such modification would not amount to a
			<lb />
			repeal -(see Craies on statute Law, 7th Edn. pp. 349, 353, 373, 374 and
			<lb />
			375; Maxwell&apos;s Interpretation of Statutes, 11th Edn. pp. 164, 390 based
			<lb />
			on Mount v. Taylor (1868) L.R. 3 C.P. 645; Southerland&apos;s Statutory
			<lb />
			Construction 3rd Edn. Vol. I, paragraphs 2014 and 2022, pp. 468 and
			<lb />
			490). Broadly speaking, the principal object of a Repealing and Amending
			<lb />
			Act is to &apos;excise dead matter, prune off superfluities and reject clearly
			<lb />
			inconsistent enactments&apos;-see Mohinder Singh v. Mst. Harbhajan Kaur.&quot;
			<lb />
			What needs to be kept in mind, as we have repeatedly expressed above is,
			<lb />
			that the issue canvassed in the judgments relied upon, was the effect of a
			<lb />
			voluntary decision of a legislature in amending or repealing an existing
			<lb />
			provision. That position would arise, if the Parliament had validly
			<lb />
			amended or repealed an existing constitutional provision. Herein, the
			<lb />
			impugned constitutional amendment has definetly the effct of
			<lb />
			substituting some of the existing provisions of the Constitution, and also,
			<lb />
			adding to it some new provisions. Naturally substitution connotes, that
			<lb />
			the earlier provision ceases to exist, and the amended provision takes its
			<lb />
			place. The present situation is one where, the impugned constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment by a process of judicial review, has been set aside. Such
			<lb />
			being the position, whatever be the cause and effect of the impugned
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment, the same will be deemed to be set aside, and
			<lb />
			the position preceding the amendment will be restored. It does not matter
			<lb />
			what are the stages or steps of the cause and effect of the amendment, all
			<lb />
			the stages and steps will stand negated, in the same fashion as they were
			<lb />
			introduced by the amendment, when the amended provisions are set
			<lb />
			aside.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(xi) In addition to the above judgment, reliance was also placed on the
			<lb />
			Kolhapur Canesugar Works Ltd. case 78 , West U.P. Sugar Mills
			<lb />
			Association v. State of U.P. 98 , Gammon India Ltd. v. Special Chief
			<lb />
			Secretary 99 , the Hirendra Pal Singh case 79 , the Joint Action Committee of
			<lb />
			Air Line Pilots&apos; Associations of India case 80 , and the K. Shyam Sunder
			<lb />
			case 81 . The conclusions drawn in the above noted judgments were either
			<lb />
			based on the judgments already dealt with by us hereinabove, or on
			<lb />
			general principles. It is not necessary to examine all the above
			<lb />
			judgments, by expressly taking note of the observations recorded in each
			<lb />
			of them.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			251. Even though we have already recorded our determination with
			<lb />
			reference to the judgments cited by the learned Solicitor General, it is
			<lb />
			imperative for us to record, that it is evident from the conclusions
			<lb />
			returned in the Central Provinces Manganese Ore Co. Ltd. case 76 , that in
			<lb />
			the facts and circumstances of the present case, it would have to be kept
			<lb />
			in mind, that if the construction suggested by the learned Solicitor
			<lb />
			General was to be adopted, it would result in the creation of a void. We
			<lb />
			say so, because if neither the impugned constitutional provision, nor the
			<lb />
			amended provisions of the Constitution would survive, it would lead to a
			<lb />
			breakdown of the constitutional machinery, inasmuch as, there would be
			<lb />
			a lacuna or a hiatus, insofar as the manner of selection and appointment
			<lb />
			of Judges to the higher judiciary is concerned. Such a position, in our
			<lb />
			view, cannot be the result of any sound process of interpretation.
			<lb />
			Likewise, from the observations emerging out of the decision rendered in
			<lb />
			the Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) Pvt. Ltd. case 95 , we are
			<lb />
			satisfied, that the clear intent of the Parliament, while enacting the
			<lb />
			Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, was to provide for a new process of
			<lb />
			selection and appointment of Judges to the higher judiciary by amending
			<lb />
			the existing provisions. Naturally therefore, when the amended provision
			<lb />
			postulating a different procedure is set aside, the original process of
			<lb />
			selection and appointment under the unamended provisions would
			<lb />
			revive. The above position also emerges from the legal position declared
			<lb />
			in the Koteswar Vittal Kamath case 73 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			252. It is not possible for us to accept the inferential contentions,
			<lb />
			advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the respondents by
			<lb />
			placing reliance on Sections 6, 7 and 8 of the General Clauses Act. We
			<lb />
			say so, because the contention of the learned Solicitor General was based
			<lb />
			on the assumption, that a judicial verdict setting aside an amendment,
			<lb />
			has the same effect as a repeal of an enactment through a legislation.
			<lb />
			This is an unacceptable assumption. When a legislature amends or
			<lb />
			repeals an existing provision, its action is of its own free will, and is
			<lb />
			premised on well founded principles of interpretation, including the
			<lb />
			provisions of the General Causes Act. Not so when an amendment/repeal
			<lb />
			is set aside through a judicial process. It is not necessary to repeat the
			<lb />
			consideration recorded in paragraph 250(ix) above. When a judgment
			<lb />
			sets aside, an amendment or a repeal by the legislature, it is but natural
			<lb />
			that the status quo ante, would stand restored.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			253. For the reasons recorded hereinabove, we are of the view, that in
			<lb />
			case of setting aside of the impugned Constitution (99th Amendment)
			<lb />
			Act, the provisions of the Constitution sought to be amended thereby,
			<lb />
			would automatically revive.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			VI. CONCLUSIONS:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			254. Article 124A constitutes the edifice of the Constitution (99th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, 2014. The striking down of Article 124A would
			<lb />
			automatically lead to the undoing of the amendments made to Articles
			<lb />
			124, 124B, 124C, 127, 128, 217, 222, 224, 224A and 231. This, for the
			<lb />
			simple reason, that the latter Articles are sustainable only if Article 124A
			<lb />
			is upheld. Article 124A(1) provides for the constitution and the
			<lb />
			composition of the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC).
			<lb />
			Its perusal reveals, that it is composed of the following:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) the Chief Justice of India, Chairperson, ex officio;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) two other senior Judges of Supreme Court, next to the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India -Members, ex officio;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(c) the Union Minister in charge of Law and Justice -Member, ex officio;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(d) two eminent persons, to be nominated -Members.
			<lb />
			If the inclusion of anyone of the Members of the NJAC is held to be
			<lb />
			unconstitutional, Article 124A will be rendered nugatory, in its entirety.
			<lb />
			While adjudicating upon the merits of the submissions advanced at the
			<lb />
			hands of the learned counsel for the rival parties, I have arrived at the
			<lb />
			conclusion, that clauses (a) and (b) of Article 124A(1) do not provide an
			<lb />
			adequate representation, to the judicial component in the NJAC, clauses
			<lb />
			(a) and (b) of Article 124A(1) are insufficient to preserve the primacy of
			<lb />
			the judiciary, in the matter of selection and appointment of Judges, to
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary (as also transfer of Chief Justices and Judges, from
			<lb />
			one High Court to another). The same are accordingly, violative of the
			<lb />
			principle of &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;. I have independently arrived
			<lb />
			at the conclusion, that clause (c) of Article 124A(1) is ultra vires the
			<lb />
			provisions of the Constitution, because of the inclusion of the Union
			<lb />
			Minister in charge of Law and Justice as an ex officio Member of the
			<lb />
			NJAC. Clause (c) of Article 124A(1), in my view, impinges upon the
			<lb />
			principles of &quot;independence of the judiciary&quot;, as well as, &quot;separation of
			<lb />
			powers&quot;. It has also been concluded by me, that clause (d) of Article
			<lb />
			124A(1) which provides for the inclusion of two &quot;eminent persons&quot; as
			<lb />
			Members of the NJAC is ultra vires the provisions of the Constitution, for
			<lb />
			a variety of reasons. The same has also been held as violative of the
			<lb />
			&quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution. In the above view of the matter, I
			<lb />
			am of the considered view, that all the clauses (a) to (d) of Article 124A(1)
			<lb />
			are liable to be set aside. The same are, accordingly struck down. In view
			<lb />
			of the striking down of Article 124A(1), the entire Constitution (99th
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, 2014 is liable to be set aside. The same is accordingly
			<lb />
			hereby struck down in its entirety, as being ultra vires the provisions of
			<lb />
			the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			255. The contention advanced at the hands of the respondents, to the
			<lb />
			effect, that the provisions of the Constitution which were sought to be
			<lb />
			amended by the impugned constitutional amendment, would not revive,
			<lb />
			even if the challenge raised by the petitioners was accepted (and the
			<lb />
			Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, 2014, was set aside), has been
			<lb />
			considered under a separate head, to the minutest detail, in terms of the
			<lb />
			submissions advanced. I have concluded, that with the setting aside of
			<lb />
			the impugned Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, 2014, the provisions
			<lb />
			of the Constitution sought to be amended thereby, would automatically
			<lb />
			revive, and the status quo ante would stand restored.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			256. The National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014 inter
			<lb />
			alia emanates from Article 124C. It has no independent existence in the
			<lb />
			absence of the NJAC, constituted under Article 124A(1). Since Articles
			<lb />
			124A and 124C have been set aside, as a natural corollary, the National
			<lb />
			Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014 is also liable to be set
			<lb />
			aside, the same is accordingly hereby struck down. In view of the above,
			<lb />
			it was not essential for us, to have examined the constitutional vires of
			<lb />
			individual provisions of the NJAC Act. I have all the same, examined the
			<lb />
			challenge raised to Sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 thereof. I have concluded, that
			<lb />
			Sections 5, 6 and 8 of the NJAC Act are ultra vires the provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />

		<p>
			VII. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			257. Before parting with the order, I would like to record my appreciation
			<lb />
			for the ablest assistance rendered to us, by the learned counsel who
			<lb />
			addressed us from both the sides. I would also like to extend my deepest
			<lb />
			sense of appreciation to all the assisting counsel, who had obviously
			<lb />
			whole heartedly devoted their time and energy in the preparation of the
			<lb />
			case, and in instructing the arguing counsel. I would be failing in my
			<lb />
			duty, if I do not express my gratitude to my colleagues on the Bench, as
			<lb />
			also, learned counsel who agreed to assist the Bench, during the summer
			<lb />
			vacation. I therefore, express my gratefulness and indebtedness to them,
			<lb />
			from the bottom of my heart.

		</p>
		<p>
			1.
			<lb />
			Very important and far reaching questions fall for
			<lb />
			the consideration of this Court in this batch of matters.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			constitutional
			<lb />
			validity
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			Constitution
			<lb />
			(Ninety-ninth Amendment) Act, 2014 and the National
			<lb />
			Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014 are under
			<lb />
			challenge.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			2.
			<lb />
			When these matters were listed for preliminary
			<lb />
			hearing on 21.04.2015, an objection was raised by Shri
			<lb />
			Fali S. Nariman, learned senior counsel appearing for one
			<lb />
			of the petitioners, that it is inappropriate for Justice
			<lb />
			Jagdish Singh Khehar to participate in the proceedings
			<lb />
			as the Presiding Judge of this Bench. The objection is
			<lb />
			predicated on the facts : Being the third senior most
			<lb />
			Puisne Judge of this Court, Justice Khehar is a member
			<lb />
			of the collegium propounded under the Second Judges
			<lb />
			case 100 exercising &quot;significant constitutional power&quot; in
			<lb />
			the matter of selection of Judges, of this Court as well as
			<lb />
			High Courts of this country; by virtue of the impugned
			<lb />
			legislation, until he attains the position of being the third
			<lb />
			senior most Judge of this Court, Justice Khehar would
			<lb />
			cease to enjoy such power; and therefore, there is a
			<lb />
			possibility of him not being impartial.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3.
			<lb />
			When the objection was raised, various counsel
			<lb />
			appearing on behalf of either side expressed different
			<lb />
			viewpoints regarding the appropriateness of participation
			<lb />
			of Justice Khehar in these proceedings. We, therefore,
			<lb />
			called upon learned counsel appearing in this matter to
			<lb />
			precisely state their respective points of view on the
			<lb />
			question and assist the Court in identifying principles of
			<lb />
			law which are relevant to arrive at the right answer to the
			<lb />
			objection raised by Shri Fali S. Nariman.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			The matter was listed again on 22.04.2015 on which
			<lb />
			date Shri Nariman filed a brief written statement 101
			<lb />
			indicating reasons which according to him make it
			<lb />
			Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association &amp; Others v. Union of India, (1993) 4 SCC 441
			<lb />
			101 The position of the Presiding Judge on this Bench hearing these cases of constitutional
			<lb />
			challenge is not consistent with (and apparently conflicts with) his position as a member of the
			<lb />
			&apos;Collegium&apos;; and is likely to be seen as such; always bearing in mind that if the Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment and the statute pertaining thereto are held constitutionally valid and are upheld, the
			<lb />
			present Presiding Judge would no longer be part of the Collegium -The Collegium, it must be
			<lb />
			acknowledged exercises significant constitutional power.
			<lb />
			Page 446
			<lb />
			inappropriate for Justice Khehar to preside over the
			<lb />
			present Bench.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			On the other hand, Shri Arvind P. Datar, learned
			<lb />
			senior counsel appearing for one of the petitioners made
			<lb />
			elaborate submissions explaining the legal principles
			<lb />
			which require a Judge to recuse himself from hearing a
			<lb />
			particular case and submitted that in the light of settled
			<lb />
			principles of law in this regard there is neither
			<lb />
			impropriety in Justice Khehar hearing these matters nor
			<lb />
			any need for him to do so.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			Shri Mukul Rohatgi, learned Attorney General very
			<lb />
			vehemently opposed the suggestion of Shri Nariman and
			<lb />
			submitted that there is nothing in law which demands
			<lb />
			the recusal of Justice Khehar nor has the Union of India
			<lb />
			any objection to Justice Khehar hearing these batch of
			<lb />
			matters.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			Shri Harish N. Salve and Shri K.K. Venugopal,
			<lb />
			learned senior counsel who proposed to appear on behalf
			<lb />
			of different States also supported the stand of the learned
			<lb />
			Attorney General and made independent submissions in
			<lb />
			support of the conclusion.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			After an elaborate hearing of the matter, we came to
			<lb />
			the unanimous conclusion that there is no principle of
			<lb />
			law which warrants Justice Khehar&apos;s recusal from the
			<lb />
			proceedings. We recorded the conclusion of the Bench in
			<lb />
			the proceedings dated 22.04.2015 and indicated that
			<lb />
			because of paucity of time, the reasons for the conclusion
			<lb />
			would follow later 102 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			At the outset, we must record that each of the
			<lb />
			learned counsel who objected to the participation of
			<lb />
			Justice Khehar in these proceedings anchored this
			<lb />
			objection on distinct propositions of law.
			<lb />
			While Shri
			<lb />
			Nariman put it on the ground of inappropriateness, Shri
			<lb />
			Santosh Paul invoked the principle of bias, on the ground
			<lb />
			of him having conflicting interests -one in his capacity as
			<lb />
			102 Order dated 22.04.2015 insofar as it is relevant reads thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;A preliminary objection, whether Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar should preside over this
			<lb />
			Bench, by virtue of his being the fourth senior most Judge of this Court, also happens to be a
			<lb />
			member of the collegium, was raised by the petitioners. Elaborate submissions were made by the
			<lb />
			learned counsel for the petitioners and the respondents. After hearing all the learned counsel, we
			<lb />
			are of the unanimous opinion that we do not see any reason in law requiring Justice Jagdish Singh
			<lb />
			Khehar to recuse himself from hearing the matter. Reasons will follow.
			<lb />
			Issue rule. &quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			member of the Collegium and the other in his capacity as
			<lb />
			a Judge to examine the constitutional validity of the
			<lb />
			provisions which seek to displace the Collegium system.
			<lb />
			In substance, some of the petitioners are of the opinion
			<lb />
			that Justice Khehar should recuse 103 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			10. It is one of the settled principles of a civilised legal
			<lb />
			system that a Judge is required to be impartial.
			<lb />
			It is
			<lb />
			said that the hallmark of a democracy is the existence of
			<lb />
			an impartial Judge.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			11. It all started with a latin maxim Nemo Judex in Re
			<lb />
			Sua which means literally -that no man shall be a judge
			<lb />
			in his own cause. There is another rule which requires a
			<lb />
			Judge to be impartial. The theoretical basis is explained
			<lb />
			by Thomas Hobbes in his Eleventh Law of Nature. He
			<lb />
			said &quot;If a man be trusted to judge between man and man, it is a precept of the
			<lb />
			law of Nature that he deal equally between them. For without that, the
			<lb />
			controversies of men cannot be determined but by war. He therefore, said that is
			<lb />
			partial in judgment doth what in him lies, to deter men from the use of judges and
			<lb />
			arbitrators; and consequently, against the fundamental law of Nature, is the cause
			<lb />
			of war.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			103 The expression &apos;recuse&apos; according to the New Oxford Dictionary English
			<lb />
			means -(the act of a Judge) to excuse himself from a case because of possible conflict of interest for
			<lb />
			lack of impartiality.

			12. Grant Hammond, a former Judge of the Court of
			<lb />
			Appeal of New Zealand and an academician, in his book
			<lb />
			titled &quot;Judicial Recusal&quot; 104 traced out principles on the
			<lb />
			law of recusal as developed in England in the following
			<lb />
			words :-

			&quot;The central feature of the early English common law on recusal

			was both simple and highly constrained: a judge could only be
			<lb />
			disqualified for a direct pecuniary interest. What would today be
			<lb />
			termed &apos;bias&apos;, which is easily the most controversial ground for
			<lb />
			disqualification, was entirely rejected as a ground for recusal of
			<lb />
			judges, although it was not completely dismissed in relation to
			<lb />
			jurors.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			This was in marked contrast to the relatively sophisticated canon
			<lb />
			law, which provided for recusal if a judge was suspected of
			<lb />
			partiality because of consanguinity, affinity, friendship or enmity
			<lb />
			with a party, or because of his subordinate status towards a party or
			<lb />
			because he was or had been a party&apos;s advocate.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			He also pointed out that in contrast in the United States
			<lb />
			of America, the subject is covered by legislation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			13. Dimes v. Proprietors of Grand Junction Canal,
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(1852) 10 ER 301, is one of the earliest cases where the
			<lb />
			question of disqualification of a Judge was considered.
			<lb />
			The ground was that he had some pecuniary interest in
			<lb />
			the matter. We are not concerned with the details of the
			<lb />
			dispute between the parties to the case. Lord Chancellor
			<lb />
			Cottenham heard the appeal against an order of the
			<lb />
			Vice-Chancellor and confirmed the order. The order went
			<lb />
			in favour of the defendant company. A year later, Dimes
			<lb />
			discovered that Lord Chancellor Cottenham had shares in
			<lb />
			the defendant company. He petitioned the Queen for her
			<lb />
			intervention. The litigation had a long and chequered
			<lb />
			history, the details of which are not material for us.
			<lb />
			Eventually, the matter reached the House of Lords. The
			<lb />
			House dismissed the appeal of Dimes on the ground that
			<lb />
			setting aside of the order of the Lord Chancellor would
			<lb />
			still leave the order of the Vice-Chancellor intact as Lord
			<lb />
			Chancellor had merely affirmed the order of the
			<lb />
			Vice-Chancellor. However, the House of Lords held that
			<lb />
			participation of Lord Cottenham in the adjudicatory
			<lb />
			process was not justified.
			<lb />
			Though Lord Campbell
			<lb />
			observed:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;No one can suppose that Lord Cottenham could be, in the
			<lb />
			remotest degree, influenced by the interest he had in this concern:
			<lb />
			but, my Lords, it is of the last importance that the maxim that no
			<lb />
			man is to be a judge in his own cause be held sacred. And that is
			<lb />
			not to be confined to a cause in which he is a party, but applies to a
			<lb />
			cause in which he has an interest …. This will be a lesson to all
			<lb />
			inferior tribunals to take care not only that in their decrees they are
			<lb />
			not influenced by their personal interest, but to avoid the
			<lb />
			appearance of labouring under such an influence.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			14. Summing up the principle laid down by the
			<lb />
			abovementioned case, Hammond observed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The &apos;no-pecuniary interest&apos; principle as expressed in Dimes
			<lb />
			requires a judge to be automatically disqualified when there is
			<lb />
			neither actual bias nor even an apprehension of bias on the part of
			<lb />
			that judge. The fundamental philosophical underpinning of Dimes
			<lb />
			is therefore predicated on a conflict of interest approach.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			15. The next landmark case on the question of &quot;bias&quot; is
			<lb />
			Regina v. Gough, (1993) AC 646. Gough was convicted
			<lb />
			for an offence of conspiracy to rob and was sentenced to
			<lb />
			imprisonment for fifteen years by the Trial Court. It was
			<lb />
			a trial by Jury. After the conviction was announced, it
			<lb />
			was brought to the notice of the Trial Court that one of
			<lb />
			the jurors was a neighbour of the convict. The convict
			<lb />
			appealed to the Court of Appeal unsuccessfully. One of
			<lb />
			the grounds on which the conviction was challenged was
			<lb />
			that, in view of the fact that one of the jurors being a
			<lb />
			neighbour of the convict presented a possibility of bias on
			<lb />
			her part and therefore the conviction is unsustainable.
			<lb />
			The Court of Appeal noticed that there are two lines of
			<lb />
			authority propounding two different tests for determining
			<lb />
			disqualification of a Judge on the ground of bias:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(1) &quot;real danger&quot; test; and
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(2) &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; test.
			<lb />
			The Court of Appeal confirmed the conviction by applying
			<lb />
			the &quot;real danger&quot; test.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16. The matter was carried further to the House of
			<lb />
			Lords.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			17. Lord Goff noticed that there are a series of
			<lb />
			authorities which are &quot;not only large in number but
			<lb />
			bewildering in their effect&quot;. After analyzing the judgment
			<lb />
			in Dimes (supra), Lord Goff held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;In such a case, therefore, not only is it irrelevant that there was in
			<lb />
			fact no bias on the part of the tribunal, but there is no question of
			<lb />
			investigating, from an objective point of view, whether there was
			<lb />
			any real likelihood of bias, or any reasonable suspicion of bias, on
			<lb />
			the facts of the particular case. The nature of the interest is such
			<lb />
			that public confidence in the administration of justice requires that
			<lb />
			the decision should not stand.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			In other words, where a Judge has a pecuniary interest,
			<lb />
			no further inquiry as to whether there was a &quot;real danger&quot;
			<lb />
			or &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; of bias is required to be
			<lb />
			undertaken.
			<lb />
			But in other cases, such an inquiry is
			<lb />
			required and the relevant test is the &quot;real danger&quot; test.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;But in other cases, the inquiry is directed to the question whether
			<lb />
			there was such a degree of possibility of bias on the part of the
			<lb />
			tribunal that the court will not allow the decision to stand. Such a
			<lb />
			question may arise in a wide variety of circumstances. These
			<lb />
			include …. cases in which the member of the tribunal has an
			<lb />
			interest in the outcome of the proceedings, which falls short of a
			<lb />
			direct pecuniary interest. Such interests may vary widely in their
			<lb />
			nature, in their effect, and in their relevance to the subject matter of
			<lb />
			the proceedings; and there is no rule …. that the possession of such
			<lb />
			an interest automatically disqualifies the member of the tribunal
			<lb />
			from sitting. Each case falls to be considered on its own facts. &quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			18. The learned Judge examined various important
			<lb />
			cases on the subject and finally concluded:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Finally, for the avoidance of doubt, I prefer to state the test in
			<lb />
			terms of real danger rather than real likelihood, to ensure that the
			<lb />
			court is thinking in terms of possibility rather than probability of
			<lb />
			bias. Accordingly, having ascertained the relevant circumstances,
			<lb />
			the court should ask itself whether, having regard to those
			<lb />
			circumstances, there was a real danger of bias on the part of the
			<lb />
			relevant member of the tribunal in question, in the sense that he
			<lb />
			might unfairly regard (or have unfairly regarded) with favour, or
			<lb />
			disfavour, the case of a party to the issue under consideration by
			<lb />
			him.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			19. Lord Woolf agreed with Lord Goff in his separate
			<lb />
			judgment. He held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;There is only one established special category and that exists
			<lb />
			where the tribunal has a pecuniary or proprietary interest in the
			<lb />
			subject matter of the proceedings as in Dimes v. Proprietors of
			<lb />
			Grand Junction Canal, 3 H.L. Case 759. The courts should
			<lb />
			hesitate long before creating any other special category since this
			<lb />
			will immediately create uncertainty as to what are the parameters
			<lb />
			of that category and what is the test to be applied in the case of that
			<lb />
			category. The real danger test is quite capable of producing the
			<lb />
			right answer and ensure that the purity of justice is maintained
			<lb />
			across the range of situations where bias may exist.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			20. In substance, the Court held that in cases where the
			<lb />
			Judge has a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the
			<lb />
			proceedings, his disqualification is automatic. No further
			<lb />
			enquiry whether such an interest lead to a &quot;real danger&quot;
			<lb />
			or gave rise to a &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; is necessary. In
			<lb />
			cases of other interest, the test to determine whether the
			<lb />
			Judge is disqualified to hear the case is the &quot;real danger&quot;
			<lb />
			test.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			21. The Pinochet 105 case added one more category to
			<lb />
			the cases of automatic disqualification for a judge.
			<lb />
			Pinochet, a former Chilean dictator, was sought to be
			<lb />
			arrested and extradited from England for his conduct
			<lb />
			during his incumbency in office. The issue was whether
			<lb />
			Pinochet was entitled to immunity from such arrest or
			<lb />
			extradition.
			<lb />
			Amnesty International, a charitable
			<lb />
			organisation, participated in the said proceedings with
			<lb />
			the leave of the Court. The House of Lords held that
			<lb />
			Pinochet
			<lb />
			did
			<lb />
			not
			<lb />
			enjoy
			<lb />
			any
			<lb />
			such
			<lb />
			immunity.
			<lb />
			Subsequently, it came to light that Lord Hoffman, one of
			<lb />
			the members of the Board which heard the Pinochet case,
			<lb />
			was a Director and Chairman of a company (known as
			<lb />
			A.I.C.L.) which was closely linked with Amnesty
			<lb />
			International. An application was made to the House of
			<lb />
			Lords to set aside the earlier judgment on the ground of
			<lb />
			bias on the part of Lord Hoffman.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			22. The House of Lords examined the following
			<lb />
			questions;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			Whether the connection of Lord Hoffman with Amnesty In-
			<lb />
			ternational required him to be automatic disqualified?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Whether an enquiry into the question whether cause of Lord
			<lb />
			Hoffman&apos;s connection with Amnesty International posed a
			<lb />
			real danger or caused a reasonable apprehension that his
			<lb />
			judgment is biased -is necessary?
			<lb />
			Did it make any difference that Lord Hoffman was only a
			<lb />
			member of a company associated with Amnesty Interna-
			<lb />
			tional which was in fact interested in securing the extradi-
			<lb />
			tion of Senator Pinochet?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			23. Lord Wilkinson summarised the principles on which
			<lb />
			a Judge is disqualified to hear a case. As per Lord
			<lb />
			Wilkinson -
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;The fundamental principle is that a man may not be a judge in his
			<lb />
			own cause. This principle, as developed by the courts, has two
			<lb />
			very similar but not identical implications. First it may be applied
			<lb />
			literally: if a judge is in fact a party to the litigation or has a
			<lb />
			financial or proprietary interest in its outcome then he is indeed
			<lb />
			sitting as a judge in his own cause. In that case, the mere fact that
			<lb />
			he is a party to the action or has a financial or proprietary interest
			<lb />
			in its outcome is sufficient to cause his automatic disqualification.
			<lb />
			The second application of the principle is where a judge is not a
			<lb />
			party to the suit and does not have a financial interest in its
			<lb />
			outcome, but in some other way his conduct or behaviour may give
			<lb />
			rise to a suspicion that he is not impartial, for example because of
			<lb />
			his friendship with a party. This second type of case is not strictly
			<lb />
			speaking an application of the principle that a man must not be
			<lb />
			judge in his own cause, since the judge will not normally be
			<lb />
			himself benefiting, but providing a benefit for another by failing to
			<lb />
			be impartial.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			In my judgment, this case falls within the first category of case, viz.
			<lb />
			where the judge is disqualified because he is a judge in his own
			<lb />
			cause. In such a case, once it is shown that the judge is himself a
			<lb />
			party to the cause, or has a relevant interest in its subject matter, he
			<lb />
			is disqualified without any investigation into whether there was a
			<lb />
			likelihood or suspicion of bias. The mere fact of his interest is
			<lb />
			sufficient to disqualify him unless he has made sufficient
			<lb />
			disclosure.
			<lb />
			And framed the question;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;….the question then arises whether, in non-financial litigation,
			<lb />
			anything other than a financial or proprietary interest in the
			<lb />
			outcome is sufficient automatically to disqualify a man from
			<lb />
			sitting as judge in the cause.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			He opined that although the earlier cases have &quot;all dealt with
			<lb />
			automatic disqualification on the grounds of pecuniary interest, there is no good
			<lb />
			reason in principle for so limiting automatic disqualification.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			24. Lord
			<lb />
			Wilkinson
			<lb />
			concluded
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			Amnesty
			<lb />
			International and its associate company known as
			<lb />
			A.I.C.L., had a non-pecuniary interest established that
			<lb />
			Senator Pinochet was not immune from the process of
			<lb />
			extradition. He concluded that, &quot;….the matter at issue does not
			<lb />
			relate to money or economic advantage but is concerned with the promotion of
			<lb />
			the cause, the rationale disqualifying a judge applies just as much if the judge&apos;s
			<lb />
			decision will lead to the promotion of a cause in which the judge is involved
			<lb />
			together with one of the parties&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			25. After so concluding, dealing with the last question,
			<lb />
			whether the fact that Lord Hoffman was only a member of
			<lb />
			A.I.C.L. but not a member of Amnesty International made
			<lb />
			any difference to the principle, Lord Wilkinson opined
			<lb />
			that even though a judge may not have financial interest in the outcome of a
			<lb />
			case, but in some other way his conduct or behaviour may give rise to a suspicion
			<lb />
			that he is not impartial and held that if the absolute impartiality of the
			<lb />
			judiciary is to be maintained, there must be a rule which automatically disqualifies
			<lb />
			a judge who is involved, whether personally or as a director of a company, in
			<lb />
			promoting the same causes in the same organisation as is a party to the suit. There
			<lb />
			is no room for fine distinctions. This aspect of the matter was
			<lb />
			considered in P.D. Dinakaran case 106 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			26. From the above decisions, in our opinion, the
			<lb />
			following principles emerge;
			<lb />
			1.
			<lb />
			If a Judge has a financial interest in the outcome
			<lb />
			of a case, he is automatically disqualified from
			<lb />
			hearing the case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			2.
			<lb />
			In cases where the interest of the Judge in the
			<lb />
			case is other than financial, then the disqualifica-
			<lb />
			tion is not automatic but an enquiry is required
			<lb />
			whether the existence of such an interest disqual-
			<lb />
			ifies the Judge tested in the light of either on the
			<lb />
			principle of &quot;real danger&quot; or &quot;reasonable appre-
			<lb />
			hension&quot; of bias.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3.
			<lb />
			The Pinochet case added a new category i.e that
			<lb />
			the Judge is automatically disqualified from hear-
			<lb />
			ing a case where the Judge is interested in a
			<lb />
			cause which is being promoted by one of the par-
			<lb />
			ties to the case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			27. It is nobody&apos;s case that, in the case at hand, Justice
			<lb />
			Khehar had any pecuniary interest or any other interest
			<lb />
			falling under the second of the above-mentioned cate-
			<lb />
			gories. By the very nature of the case, no such interest
			<lb />
			can arise at all.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			28. The question is whether the principle of law laid
			<lb />
			down in Pinochet case is attracted.
			<lb />
			In other words,
			<lb />
			whether Justice Khehar can be said to be sharing any in-
			<lb />
			terest which one of the parties is promoting. All the par-
			<lb />
			ties to these proceedings claim to be promoting the cause
			<lb />
			of ensuring the existence of an impartial and independent
			<lb />
			judiciary.
			<lb />
			The only difference of opinion between the
			<lb />
			parties is regarding the process by which such a result is
			<lb />
			to be achieved. Therefore, it cannot be said that Justice
			<lb />
			Khehar shares any interest which any one of the parties
			<lb />
			to the proceeding is seeking to promote.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			29. The implication of Shri Nariman&apos;s submission is
			<lb />
			that Justice Khehar would be pre-determined to hold the
			<lb />
			impugned legislation to be invalid. We fail to understand
			<lb />
			the stand of the petitioners. If such apprehension of the
			<lb />
			petitioners comes true, the beneficiaries would be the pe-
			<lb />
			titioners only. The grievance, if any, on this ground
			<lb />
			should be on the part of the respondents.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			30. The learned Attorney General appearing for the
			<lb />
			Union of India made an emphatic statement that the
			<lb />
			Union of India has no objection for Justice Khehar
			<lb />
			hearing the matter as a presiding Judge of the Bench.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			31. No precedent has been brought to our notice, where
			<lb />
			courts ruled at the instance of the beneficiary of bias on
			<lb />
			the part of the adjudicator, that a judgment or an
			<lb />
			administrative decision is either voidable or void on the
			<lb />
			ground of bias.
			<lb />
			On the other hand, it is a well
			<lb />
			established principle of law that an objection based on
			<lb />
			bias of the adjudicator can be waived. Courts generally
			<lb />
			did not entertain such objection raised belatedly by the
			<lb />
			aggrieved party.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The right to object to a disqualified adjudicator may be waived,
			<lb />
			and this may be so even where the disqualification is statutory. 107
			<lb />
			The court normally insists that the objection shall be taken as soon
			<lb />
			as the party prejudiced knows the facts which entitle him to object.
			<lb />
			If, after he or his advisers know of the disqualification, they let the
			<lb />
			proceedings continue without protest, they are held to have waived
			<lb />
			their objection and the determination cannot be challenged.&quot; 108
			<lb />
			In our opinion, the implication of the above principle is
			<lb />
			that only a party who has suffered or likely to suffer an
			<lb />
			adverse adjudication because of the possibility of bias on
			<lb />
			the part of the adjudicator can raise the objection.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			32. The significant power as described by Shri Nariman
			<lb />
			does not inhere only to the members of the Collegium,
			<lb />
			but inheres in every Judge of this Court who might be
			<lb />
			called upon to express his opinion regarding the
			<lb />
			proposals of various appointments of the High Court
			<lb />
			Judges, Chief Justices or Judges of this Court, while the
			<lb />
			members of the Collegium are required to exercise such
			<lb />
			&quot;significant power&quot; with respect to each and every
			<lb />
			appointment of the above-mentioned categories, the other
			<lb />
			Judges of this Court are required to exercise such
			<lb />
			&quot;significant power&quot;, at least with respect to the
			<lb />
			appointments to or from the High Court with which they
			<lb />

			v. Antrim Justices [1895] 2 I.R. 603; Tolputt (H.) &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Mole [1911] 1 K.B. 836; Corrigan
			<lb />
			v. Irish Land Commission [1977] I.R. 317.
			<lb />
			Page 461
			<lb />
			were earlier associated with either as judges or Chief
			<lb />
			Justices. The argument of Shri Nariman, if accepted
			<lb />
			would render all the Judges of this Court disqualified
			<lb />
			from hearing the present controversy. A result not legally
			<lb />
			permitted by the &quot;doctrine of necessity&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			33. For the above-mentioned reasons, we reject the
			<lb />
			submission that Justice Khehar should recuse from the
			<lb />
			proceedings.

			We the members of the judiciary exult and frolic in our
			<lb />
			emancipation from the other two organs of the State. But have
			<lb />
			we developed an alternate constitutional morality to
			<lb />
			emancipate us from the theory of checks and balances, robust
			<lb />
			enough to keep us in control from abusing such
			<lb />
			independence? Have we acquired independence greater than

		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;124A (1) There shall be a Commission to be known as the
			<lb />
			National Judicial Appointments Commission consisting of the
			<lb />

		<item>
			(2) No act or proceedings of the National Judicial
			<lb />

			<lb />
			invalidated merely on the ground of the existence of any
			<lb />
			vacancy or defect in the constitution of the Commission.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			124B. It shall be the duty of the National Judicial Appointments
			<lb />
			Commission to -
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(a) recommend persons for appointment as Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, Judges of the Supreme Court, Chief Justices of High
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(c) ensure that the person recommended is of ability and

			<lb />

		<p>
			124C. Parliament may, by law, regulate the procedure for the
			<lb />
			appointment of Chief Justice of India and other Judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court and Chief Justices and other Judges of High Courts
			<lb />
			and empower the Commission to lay down by regulations the
			<lb />
			procedure for the discharge of its functions, the manner of selection
			<lb />
			of persons for appointment and such other matters as may be
			<lb />
			considered necessary by it.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Consequent amendments to other Articles are also made,
			<lb />
			details are not necessary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			The crux of the AMENDMENT is that the institutional
			<lb />
			mechanism by which selection and appointment process of the
			<lb />
			Judges of CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS was undertaken came to be
			<lb />
			substituted by a new body called the National Judicial
			<lb />
			Appointments Commission (hereinafter referred to as NJAC). It
			<lb />
			consists of six members. The CJI is its ex-officio Chairperson.
			<lb />
			Two senior Judges of the Supreme Court next to the CJI and
			<lb />
			the Union Law Minister are also ex-officio members, apart from
			<lb />
			two eminent persons to be nominated by a Committee contemplated
			<lb />
			in Article 124A (1)(d).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			Under Article 124B, the NJAC is charged with the duty of
			<lb />
			recommending persons of ability and integrity for appointment as Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, Judges of the Supreme Court, Chief Justices of High Courts and other
			<lb />
			Judges of High Courts and of recommending transfer of Chief Justices and other
			<lb />
			Judges of High Courts from one High Court to any other High Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			Article 124C authorizes Parliament to regulate by law, the
			<lb />
			procedure for the appointment of Chief Justice and other
			<lb />
			Judges of the Supreme Court etc. It also empowers the NJAC
			<lb />
			to make regulations laying down the procedure for the
			<lb />
			discharge of its functions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			Pursuant to the mandate of Article 124C, Parliament
			<lb />
			made the ACT. For the present, suffice it to note that though
			<lb />
			the amended text of the Constitution does not so provide,
			<lb />
			Section 6(6) 110 of the ACT provides that the NJAC shall not
			<lb />
			recommend a person for appointment, if any two members of
			<lb />
			the Commission do not agree for such recommendation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			10. The AMENDMENT made far reaching changes in the
			<lb />
			scheme of the Constitution, insofar as it relates to the selection
			<lb />
			process of Judges of the CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			110 Section 6 (6). &quot;The Commission shall not recommend a person for appointment under this section if
			<lb />
			any two members of the Commission do not agree for such recommendation.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Page 469
			<lb />
			President is no more obliged for making appointments to
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS to consult the CJI, the Chief Justices
			<lb />
			of High Courts and Governors of the States but is obliged to
			<lb />
			consult the NJAC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			11. The challenge to the AMENDMENT is principally on the
			<lb />
			ground that such substitution undermines the independence
			<lb />
			of the judiciary. It is contended that independence of judiciary
			<lb />
			is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution and the
			<lb />
			AMENDMENT is subversive of such independence. Hence, it is
			<lb />
			beyond the competence of the Parliament in view of the law
			<lb />
			declared by this Court in His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati
			<lb />
			Sripadagalvaru v. State of Kerala &amp; Another, (1973) 4 SCC 225
			<lb />
			(hereinafter referred to as Bharati case).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			12. Fortunately there is no difference of opinion between the
			<lb />
			parties to this lis regarding the proposition that existence of an
			<lb />
			independent judiciary is an essential requisite of a democratic
			<lb />
			Republic. Nor is there any difference of opinion regarding the
			<lb />
			proposition that an independent judiciary is one of the basic
			<lb />
			features of the Constitution of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			13. The only issue is what is the permissible procedure or
			<lb />
			mechanism which would ensure establishment of an
			<lb />
			independent judiciary. The resolution of the issue requires
			<lb />
			examination of the following questions;
			<lb />
			Whether the mechanism established by the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly for the appointment of Judges of the
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS is the only permissible mode for
			<lb />
			securing an independent judiciary or can there be
			<lb />
			alternatives?
			<lb />
			If there can be alternatives, whether the mechanism (NJAC)
			<lb />
			sought to be established by the AMENDMENT transgresses
			<lb />
			the boundaries of the constituent power?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			14. In the last few weeks, after the conclusion of hearing in
			<lb />
			this batch of matters, I heard many a person -say that the
			<lb />
			whole country is awaiting the judgment. Some even said the
			<lb />
			whole world is awaiting. There is certainly an element of
			<lb />
			hyperbole in those statements. Even those who are really
			<lb />
			waiting, I am sure, have concerns which vary from person to
			<lb />
			person. Inquisitiveness regarding the jurisprudential and
			<lb />
			political correctness, impact on the future of the judiciary,
			<lb />
			assessment of political and personal fortunes etc. could be
			<lb />
			some of those concerns. I am only reminded of Justice Fazal
			<lb />
			Ali&apos;s view in S.P. Gupta v. Union of India &amp; Ors. 111 AIR 1982 SC
			<lb />
			149 (for short S.P. Gupta case) that the issue is irrelevant for
			<lb />
			the masses and litigants. They only want that their cases should be
			<lb />
			decided quickly by judges who generate confidence. The question is -what
			<lb />
			is the formula by which judges -who can decide cases quickly
			<lb />
			and also generate confidence in the masses and litigants -be
			<lb />
			produced. What are the qualities which make a Judge decide
			<lb />
			cases quickly and also generate confidence?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			15. Deep learning in law, incisive and alert mind to quickly
			<lb />
			grasp the controversy, energy and commitment to resolve the
			<lb />
			problem are critical elements which make a Judge efficient and
			<lb />
			enable him to decide cases quickly. However, every Judge who
			<lb />
			has all the above-mentioned qualities need not automatically
			<lb />
			111 &quot;Para 520. There is another fact of life which, however unpleasant, cannot be denied and this is that
			<lb />
			precious little are our masses or litigants concerned with which Judge is appointed or not appointed or
			<lb />
			which one is continued or not continued. The high sounding concept of independence of judiciary or
			<lb />
			primacy of one or the other of the Constitutional functionaries or the mode of effective consultation are
			<lb />
			matters of academic interest in which our masses are least interested. On the other hand, they are mainly
			<lb />
			concerned with dangerous forces at work and evils reflected in economic-pressures, inflationary
			<lb />
			tendencies, gruelling poverty, emancipation of women, maintenance of law and order, food and clothing,
			<lb />
			bread and butter, and above all the serious problem of unemployment,
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			521. It is only a sizeable section of the intellectuals consisting of the press and the lawyers who
			<lb />
			have made a prestigious issue of the independence of judiciary. I can fully understand that lawyers or other
			<lb />
			persons directly connected with the administration of justice may have a grievance however ill-founded that
			<lb />
			proper selection of Judges or interference with the appointment of Judges strictly according to constitutional
			<lb />
			provisions may mar the institution of judiciary and therefore they may to some extent be justified in
			<lb />
			vindicating their rights. But at the same time, however biting or bitter, distasteful and diabolical it may seem
			<lb />
			to be, the fact remains that the masses in general are not at all concerned with these legal niceties and so
			<lb />
			far as administration of justice is concerned they merely want that their cases should be decided quickly
			<lb />
			by Judges who generate confidence.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Page 472
			<lb />
			be a Judge who can generate confidence in the litigants unless
			<lb />
			the litigant believes that the Judge is absolutely fair and
			<lb />
			impartial.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16. Belief regarding the impartiality of a Judge depends upon
			<lb />
			the fact that Judge shares no relationship with either of the
			<lb />
			parties to the litigation. Relationship in the context could be
			<lb />
			personal, financial, political or even philosophical etc. When
			<lb />
			one of the parties to the litigation is either the State or one of
			<lb />
			its instrumentalities, necessarily there is a relationship.
			<lb />
			Because, it is the State which establishes the judiciary.
			<lb />
			Funds required to run the judicial system including the
			<lb />
			salaries and allowances of Judges necessarily flow from the
			<lb />
			State exchequer.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			17. Democratic societies believe that the State not only has
			<lb />
			authority to govern but also certain legally enforceable
			<lb />
			obligations to its subjects. The authority of judicial fora to
			<lb />
			command the State to discharge its obligations flows from the
			<lb />
			existence of such enforceable obligations. To generate
			<lb />
			confidence that the judicial fora decide controversies brought
			<lb />
			to their consideration impartially, they are required to be
			<lb />
			independent.
			<lb />
			Notwithstanding the fact that they are
			<lb />
			established and organized by the State as a part of its larger
			<lb />
			obligation to govern.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			18. Judiciary is the watchdog of the Constitution and its
			<lb />
			fundamental values.
			<lb />
			It is also said to be the lifeblood of
			<lb />
			constitutionalism in democratic societies.
			<lb />
			At least since Marbury v.
			<lb />
			Madison 112 the authority of courts functioning under a written
			<lb />
			democratic constitution takes within its sweep the power to
			<lb />
			declare unconstitutional even laws made by the legislature. It
			<lb />
			is a formidable authority necessarily implying an awesome
			<lb />
			responsibility. A wise exercise of such power requires an
			<lb />
			efficient and independent Judge (Judicial System). In the
			<lb />
			context, wisdom is to perceive with precision whether the
			<lb />
			legislative action struck the constitutionally demanded balance
			<lb />
			between the larger interests of society and liberties of subjects.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19. Independence of such fora rests on two integers -
			<lb />
			independence of the institution and of individuals who man
			<lb />
			the institution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;(Judicial independence) connotes not merely a state of mind or
			<lb />
			attitude in the actual exercise of judicial functions, but a status or
			<lb />
			relationship to others, particularly to the executive branch of
			<lb />
			government, that rests on objective conditions or guarantees.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			*
			<lb />
			*
			<lb />
			*
			<lb />
			It is generally agreed that judicial independence involves both
			<lb />
			individual and institutional relationships: the individual
			<lb />
			independence of a judge, as reflected in such matters as security of
			<lb />
			tenure, and the institutional independence of the court or tribunal
			<lb />
			over which he or she presides, as reflected in its institutional or
			<lb />
			administrative relationships to the executive and legislative
			<lb />
			branches of Government.&quot; 113
			<lb />
			20. It is not really necessary for me to trace the entire history
			<lb />
			of development of the concept independence of the judiciary in
			<lb />
			democratic societies. It can be said without any fear of
			<lb />
			contradiction that all modern democratic societies strive to
			<lb />
			establish an independent judiciary. The following are among
			<lb />
			the most essential safeguards to ensure the independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary -Certainty of tenure, protection from removal
			<lb />
			from office except by a stringent process in the cases of Judges
			<lb />
			found unfit to continue as members of the judiciary, protection
			<lb />
			of salaries and other privileges from interference by the
			<lb />
			executive and the legislature, immunity from scrutiny either by
			<lb />
			the Executive or the Legislature of the conduct of Judges with
			<lb />
			respect to the discharge of judicial functions except in cases of
			<lb />
			alleged misbehaviour, immunity from civil and criminal
			<lb />
			liability for acts committed in discharge of duties, protection
			<lb />
			against criticism to a great degree. Such safeguards are
			<lb />
			provided with a fond hope that so protected, a Judge would be
			<lb />
			absolutely independent and fearless in discharge of his duties.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			21. Democratic societies by and large recognize the necessity
			<lb />
			of the abovementioned protections for the judiciary and its
			<lb />
			members.
			<lb />
			Such protections are either entrenched in the
			<lb />
			Constitution or provided by legislation. A brief survey of the
			<lb />
			constitutions of a few democratic Republics to demonstrate the
			<lb />
			point;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			22. Prior to 1701, the British Crown had the power to
			<lb />
			dismiss the judges at will. The Act of Settlement, 1701 114
			<lb />
			removed from the Crown the power to dismiss Judges of the
			<lb />
			Superior Courts at will. It enabled the Monarch to remove
			<lb />
			Judges from office upon address of both Houses of Parliament.
			<lb />
			Interestingly till 1720 Judges ceased to hold office on the
			<lb />
			death of the Monarch who issued Commissions. A 1720
			<lb />
			enactment provided that Judges should continue in office for
			<lb />
			six months after demise of the monarch. In 1761 a statute
			<lb />
			provided that commissions of the Judges shall remain in full force and effect during
			<lb />
			good behaviour notwithstanding the demise of His Majesty or of any of his heirs and
			<lb />
			114 &quot;… judges commissions be made quamdiu se bene gesserint, and their salaries ascertained and
			<lb />
			established; but upon the address of both houses of parliament it may be lawful to remove them.&quot;
			<lb />
			This clause has been repealed by ____
			<lb />
			successors -thus granting a life tenure.
			<lb />
			According to
			<lb />
			Blackstone,
			<lb />
			&quot;(I) In this distinct and separate existence of the judicial power in a
			<lb />
			peculiar body of men, nominated indeed, but not removable at
			<lb />
			pleasure by the Crown, consists one main preservative of the public
			<lb />
			liberty which cannot subsist long in any State unless the
			<lb />
			administration of common justice be in some degree separated
			<lb />
			both from the legislative and from the executive power.&quot; 115
			<lb />
			23. Article III (1) 116 of the American Constitution stipulates
			<lb />
			that Judges of the Supreme Court and also the inferior Courts
			<lb />
			established by Congress shall hold their office during good
			<lb />
			behavior and they cannot be removed except through the
			<lb />
			process of impeachment 117 . It also stipulates that they shall
			<lb />
			receive a compensation for their services which shall not be
			<lb />
			diminished during their continuance in office.

		<p>
			24. Section 72 118 of the Constitution of Australia stipulates
			<lb />
			that Judges of the High Court and other Courts created by

			<lb />
			116 Article III Section I. The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and
			<lb />
			in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the
			<lb />
			supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behaviour, and shall, at stated times,
			<lb />
			receive for their services, a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in
			<lb />
			office.
			<lb />
			117 Article II Section 4. The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be

			25. When India became a Sovereign Republic, we did not
			<lb />
			adopt the British Constitutional system in its entirety -though
			<lb />
			India had been a part of the British Empire Ever since, the
			<lb />
			British Crown started asserting sovereignty over the territory of
			<lb />
			India, the British Parliament made Acts which provided legal
			<lb />
			framework for the governance of India from time to time known
			<lb />
			as Government of India Acts. The last of which was of 1935.
			<lb />
			Canada 119 and Australia 120 which were also part of the British
			<lb />
			Empire continue to be governed by Constitutions enacted by
			<lb />
			the British Parliament.
			<lb />
			We framed a new Constitution
			<lb />
			through a Constituent Assembly.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			26. Members of the Constituent Assembly in general and the
			<lb />
			Drafting Committee in particular were men and women of
			<lb />
			great political experience, deep insight into human nature, and
			<lb />
			a profound comprehension of the complex problems of Indian
			<lb />
			Society. They spearheaded the freedom movement. They were

			well versed in history, law, political sciences and democratic
			<lb />
			practices. They examined the various constitutional systems in
			<lb />
			vogue in different democratic societies inter alia American,
			<lb />
			Australian, British and Canadian and adopted different
			<lb />
			features from different constitutional systems after suitably
			<lb />
			modifying them to the needs of Indian society.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			27. Framers of the Constitution had the advantage of an
			<lb />
			intimate knowledge of the functioning of the Federal Court, the
			<lb />
			High Courts and the Subordinate Courts of this country under
			<lb />
			the Government of India Act, 1935 121 . Though there several
			<lb />
			distinctions in the architecture of the judicial systems under
			<lb />
			each of the above-mentioned regimes, one feature common to
			<lb />
			all of them is that appointment of Judges is by the Executive.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			121 The existing constitution and organization of constitutional courts in this country is discussed in some
			<lb />
			detail by Justice Verma in the Second Judges case at paras 444, 445, 446.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			444. The Government of India Act, 1919 provided in Section 101 for the Constitution of High
			<lb />
			Courts; and the appointment of the Chief Justice and the permanent Judges was in the absolute discretion of
			<lb />
			the Crown, subject only the prescribed conditions of eligibility. The tenure of their office, according to
			<lb />
			Section 102, was dependent entirely on the Crown&apos;s pleasure.

			<lb />

			<lb />
			445. Then, in the Government of India Act, 1935, provision for the establishment and Constitution
			<lb />
			of the Federal Court was made in Section 200, while the Constitution of High Courts was provided for in
			<lb />
			Section 220.
			<lb />
			xxxxx
			<lb />

			<lb />
			446. Thus, even under the Government of India Act, 1935, appointments of Judges of the Federal
			<lb />
			Court and the High Courts were in the absolute discretion of the Crown or, in other words, of the executive,
			<lb />
			with no specific provision for consultation with the Chief Justice in the appointment process.
			<lb />
			Page 479
			<lb />
			Such constitutional design is essentially a legacy of the British
			<lb />
			constitutional system where the Executive had (till 2006) the
			<lb />
			absolute authority to appoint Judges.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			28. Judges, in any country, are expected to maintain a higher
			<lb />
			degree of rectitude compared to the other public office holders.
			<lb />
			The expectation with respect to the Indian Judiciary is no
			<lb />
			different. The Constitution therefore provides extraordinary
			<lb />
			safeguards and privileges for Judges of CONSTITUTIONAL
			<lb />
			COURTS to insulate them substantially from the possibility of
			<lb />
			interference by the political-executive as well as elected
			<lb />
			majorities of the people&apos;s representatives 122 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			I.
			<lb />
			a Judge&apos;s appointment and continuance in office is not
			<lb />
			subject to any election process;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			II.
			<lb />
			the termination of judicial appointment (during
			<lb />
			subsistence of the tenure) is made virtually impossible.
			<lb />
			The Constitution prescribes that a Judge of
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTIONAL COURT shall not be removed from office
			<lb />
			except by following an elaborate procedure of
			<lb />
			impeachment prescribed under Article 124(4) 123 which is

			29. Unscrupulous litigants constantly keep searching for
			<lb />
			ways to influence judges.
			<lb />
			Attitude of the State or its
			<lb />
			instrumentalities (largest litigants in modern democracies)
			<lb />
			would be no different 129 . Such temptation coupled with the
			<lb />
			fact that the State has the legal authority to make laws
			<lb />
			including the laws that determine the process of selection of
			<lb />
			judges and their service conditions can pose the greatest
			<lb />
			threat to the independence of the judiciary if such law making
			<lb />
			authority is without any limitations. Therefore, extraordinary
			<lb />
			safeguards to protect the tenure and service conditions of the
			<lb />
			members of the judiciary are provided in the Constitution; with
			<lb />
			a fond hope that men and women, who hold judicial offices so
			<lb />
			protected will be able to discharge their functions with
			<lb />
			absolute independence and efficiency.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			30. However, any amount of legal and institutional protection
			<lb />
			will not supply the necessary independence and efficiency to
			<lb />
			individuals if inherently they are lacking in them. Where every

			<lb />
			&quot;I once knew a fine, independent judge in South Africa during the days of apartheid -Judge-
			<lb />
			President John Milne of the Natal Supreme Court. We used to correspond, and Milne said something
			<lb />
			similar. Milne wrote to me on one occasion (in despair) :
			<lb />
			It seems that however much they may pay lip service to the idea that the Judiciary
			<lb />
			is totally independent of the Executive, politicians throughout the ages and throughout the
			<lb />
			world would actually much prefer to have executive minded lackeys and are considerably
			<lb />
			irritated by independent Judges functioning in an independent manner.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Page 482
			<lb />
			aspect of judge&apos;s service is protected by the Constitution, the
			<lb />
			only way governments can think of gaining some control over
			<lb />
			the judiciary is by making an effort to appoint persons who are
			<lb />
			inherently pliable. There are various factors which make a
			<lb />
			Judge pliable. Some of the factors are -individual ambition,
			<lb />
			loyalty-based on political, religious or sectarian considerations,
			<lb />
			incompetence and lack of integrity.
			<lb />
			Any one of the
			<lb />
			above-mentioned factors is sufficient to make a Judge pliable.
			<lb />
			A combination of more than one of them makes a Judge more
			<lb />
			vulnerable. Combination of incompetence and ambition is the
			<lb />
			worst. The only way an ambitious incompetent person can
			<lb />
			ascend a high public office is by cringing before men in power.
			<lb />
			It is said that men in power promote the least of mankind with
			<lb />
			a fond hope that those who lack any accomplishment would be
			<lb />
			grateful to their benefactor. History is replete with examples -
			<lb />
			though proof of the expected loyalty is very scarce. Usually
			<lb />
			such men are only loyal to power but not to the benefactor.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			31. In order to ensure that at least in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges, such aberrations are avoided,
			<lb />
			democracies all over the world have adopted different
			<lb />
			strategies for choosing the &apos;right people&apos; as Judges.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			procedures adopted for making such a choice are widely
			<lb />
			different. To demonstrate the same, it is useful to examine
			<lb />
			the judicial systems of some of the English speaking countries.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			32. The Constitution of the United States of America
			<lb />
			empowers the President to appoint Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court 130 with the advice and consent of the Senate 131 . Insofar as the
			<lb />
			appointment of the Judges of the highest court in United
			<lb />
			States is concerned, neither the Chief Justice of America nor
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court is assigned any role. The Head of the
			<lb />
			Executive is conferred with exclusive power to make the choice
			<lb />
			of the Judges of the highest court subject to the advice and consent
			<lb />
			of the Senate. A check on the possibility of arbitrary exercise
			<lb />
			of the power by the President.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			33. The Canadian legal system depicts another interesting
			<lb />
			model. The Supreme Court of Canada is not established by
			<lb />
			the Constitution i.e. the Constitution Act of 1867. Chapter VII
			<lb />
			of the Act deals with the judicature. Section 101 132 only
			<lb />
			130 Article II Section 2
			<lb />
			The President &quot;shall have power … to .. nominate and by and with the advise and consent of the
			<lb />
			Senate .. appoint .. Judges of the Supreme Court ..&quot;
			<lb />
			In the case of the appointment of Judges of the other Statutory Federal Courts, the Congress
			<lb />
			can by law entrust the power to the Supreme Court itself.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			131 The Federal Legislature of America is called the Congress of the United States consisting of two
			<lb />
			chambers -Senate and House of Representatives.
			<lb />
			132 Section 101. The Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from Time to Time
			<lb />
			provide for the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada, and
			<lb />
			for the Establishment of any additional Courts for the better Administration of the Laws of Canada.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>

			<lb />
			authorises the Parliament of Canada to provide for the
			<lb />
			constitution, maintenance and organisation of a general court of appeal of Canada and
			<lb />
			for the establishment of any additional courts for the better
			<lb />
			administration of the laws of Canada. It is in exercise of such
			<lb />
			power, the Parliament of Canada in 1875 by a statute, (the
			<lb />
			Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, 1875 133 ) established the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada&apos;s
			<lb />
			existence, its composition and jurisdiction depend upon an
			<lb />
			ordinary federal statute and these underwent many changes
			<lb />
			over time.
			<lb />
			In theory, the Court could be abolished by
			<lb />
			unilateral action of the Federal Parliament.
			<lb />
			Judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court are appointed by the Governor in Council (the
			<lb />
			federal cabinet) in exercise of the power conferred under
			<lb />
			Section 2 of the Supreme Court Act (supra). There is no
			<lb />
			requirement in Canada that such appointments be ratified by
			<lb />
			the Senate or the House of Commons.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			34. In Australia, the highest Federal Court is called the High
			<lb />
			Court of Australia established under Section 71 134 of the
			<lb />
			133 Now replaced by Supreme Court Act, 1985.
			<lb />
			134
			<lb />
			Section 71. Judicial power and Courts
			<lb />
			The judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Supreme Court, to
			<lb />
			be called the High Court of Australia, and in such other federal courts as the Parliament creates, and in such
			<lb />
			other courts as it invests with federal jurisdiction. The High Court shall consist of a Chief Justice, and so
			<lb />
			many other Justices, not less than two, as the Parliament prescribes.
			<lb />
			Page 485
			<lb />
			Australian Constitution. It consists of a Chief Justice and
			<lb />
			other Judges not less than two as the Parliament prescribes.
			<lb />
			Judges of the High Court are appointed by the Governor
			<lb />
			General in Council.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			35. Neither Canada nor Australia provide the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			or Judges of the highest court any role in the choice of Judges
			<lb />
			of the Constitutional Courts. In Australia, unlike the American
			<lb />
			model, there is no provision in the Constitution requiring
			<lb />
			consent of the federal legislature for such appointments.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			36. England is unique in these matters. It has no written
			<lb />
			constitution as understood in India, US, Canada and
			<lb />
			Australia.
			<lb />
			Till 2006, appointments of Judges were made
			<lb />
			exclusively by the Lord Chancellor of the Exchequer who is a
			<lb />
			member of the Cabinet.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			37. The makers of the Indian Constitution after a study of the
			<lb />
			various models mentioned above among others, provided that
			<lb />
			in making appointment of the Judges of the CONSTITUTIONAL
			<lb />
			COURTS, the CJI and the Chief Justices of the concerned High
			<lb />
			Court are required to be consulted by the President who is the
			<lb />
			appointing authority of Judges of these Courts. The text of
			<lb />
			the Constitution clearly excluded any role either for the
			<lb />
			Parliament or for the State Legislatures.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			38. Dr. Ambedkar explained the scheme of the Constitution
			<lb />
			insofar as it pertains to appointment of Judges of the
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS and the competing concerns which
			<lb />
			weighed with the drafting committee for adopting such model:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;There can be no difference of opinion in the House that our
			<lb />
			judiciary must both be independent of the executive and
			<lb />
			must also be competent in itself. And the question is how
			<lb />
			these two objects could be secured. There are two different
			<lb />
			ways in which this matter is governed in other countries. In Great
			<lb />
			Britain the appointments are made by the Crown, without any
			<lb />
			kind of limitation whatsoever, which means by the executive
			<lb />
			of the day. There is the opposite system in the United States
			<lb />
			where, for instance, officers of the Supreme Court as well as
			<lb />
			other offices of the State shall be made only with the
			<lb />
			concurrence of the Senate in the United States. It seems to
			<lb />
			me in the circumstances in which we live today, where the
			<lb />
			sense of responsibility has not grown to the same extent to
			<lb />
			which we find it in the United States, it would be
			<lb />
			dangerous to leave the appointments to be made by the
			<lb />
			President, without any kind of reservation or limitation,
			<lb />
			that is to say, merely on the advice of the executive of the
			<lb />
			day. Similarly, it seems to me that to make every
			<lb />
			appointment which the executive wishes to make subject to
			<lb />
			the concurrence of the Legislature is also not a very
			<lb />
			suitable provision. Apart from its being cumbrous, it also
			<lb />
			involves the possibility of the appointment being influenced
			<lb />
			by
			<lb />
			political
			<lb />
			pressure
			<lb />
			and political
			<lb />
			considerations.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The draft article, therefore, steers a middle course. It does not
			<lb />
			make the President the supreme and the absolute authority in
			<lb />
			the matter of making appointments. It does not also
			<lb />
			import the influence of the Legislature. The provision in the
			<lb />
			article is that there should be consultation of persons who are
			<lb />
			ex hypothesi, well qualified to give proper advice in matters
			<lb />
			of this sort, and my judgment is that this sort of provision
			<lb />
			may be regarded as sufficient for the moment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			With regard to the question of the concurrence of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice, it seems to me that those who advocate that
			<lb />
			proposition seem to rely implicitly both on the impartiality of
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice and the soundness of his judgment. I
			<lb />
			personally feel no doubt that the Chief Justice is a very
			<lb />
			eminent person. But after all the Chief Justice is a man with
			<lb />
			all the failings, all the sentiments and all the prejudices
			<lb />
			which we as common people have; and I think, to allow the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice practically a veto upon the appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges is really to transfer the authority to the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice which we are not prepared to vest in the President
			<lb />
			or the Government of the day. I therefore, think that that
			<lb />
			is also a dangerous proposition 135 .&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
			The following are salient features of Dr. Ambedkar&apos;s statement:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			1.
			<lb />
			That the judiciary must be both independent
			<lb />
			and competent.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			2.
			<lb />
			It is dangerous to confer an unchecked power
			<lb />
			of choosing or appointing Judges on the
			<lb />
			executive. The concurrence of the legislature
			<lb />
			is also not desirable as it leads to a possibility
			<lb />
			of appointments being influenced by political
			<lb />
			considerations or under political pressure.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) Requiring concurrence of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice is also a dangerous proposition.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) That, the Chief Justice is also a human
			<lb />
			being and is a man with all the failings,
			<lb />
			sentiments and prejudices which common
			<lb />
			people are supposed to have 136 .

			135 Constituent Assembly Debates, 24th May 1949 (Vol. VIII)
			<lb />
			136 Recall the words of Jackson, J. in Sacher v. United States 343 US 1 (1952) &quot;Men who make their way to
			<lb />
			the Bench sometimes exhibit vanity, irascibility, narrowness, arrogance, and other weaknesses to which
			<lb />
			human flesh is heir.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Page 488
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(c) Providing for the concurrence of CJI
			<lb />
			would be conferring a power of veto on the CJI
			<lb />
			which in substance means transferring the
			<lb />
			power of appointment to the CJI without any
			<lb />
			limitation, which the Constituent Assembly
			<lb />
			thought it imprudent to confer on the
			<lb />
			President.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			That, the Drafting Committee thought the
			<lb />
			arrangements, specified under Articles 124 and
			<lb />
			217 (as they stood prior to the AMENDMENT),
			<lb />
			would ensure requisite independence and
			<lb />
			competence of the judiciary and such
			<lb />
			arrangements would be sufficient for the
			<lb />
			&quot;moment&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			39.
			<lb />
			Till 1977, the true meaning and amplitude of the
			<lb />
			expression consultation occurring in Articles 124 and 217 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution of India troubled neither the executive nor the
			<lb />
			judiciary. There had always been a consultation between the
			<lb />
			constitutional functionaries. Appointments were made without
			<lb />
			much
			<lb />
			controversy.
			<lb />
			This
			<lb />
			Court

			Supreme

			Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of India, (1993) 4
			<lb />
			SCC 441 (hereinafter referred to as the Second Judges case)
			<lb />
			recorded so 137 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			40. Article 222 138 authorises the President to transfer High
			<lb />
			Court Judges in consultation with the CJI. Till 1975, that
			<lb />
			power was very rarely exercised by the President. In 1976 139 ,
			<lb />
			the power under Article 222 was invoked to make a mass transfer of
			<lb />
			16 High Court Judges 140 . One of the 16 Judges, though complied
			<lb />
			with the order of transfer but challenged the transfer by filing
			<lb />
			a petition pro bono publico to assert and vindicate the independence of the Judiciary 141 .
			<lb />

			<lb />
			meaning of the expression consultation occurring under Article
			<lb />
			222(1) fell for the consideration of this Court. The matter,
			<lb />
			Union of India v. Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth &amp; Anr., (1977) 4
			<lb />
			SCC 193 (for short Sankalchand case) was heard by five
			<lb />
			Judges.
			<lb />
			Four separate judgments were delivered by
			<lb />
			Chandrachud, Bhagwati, Krishna Iyer, and Untwalia, JJ.
			<lb />
			Justice Chandrachud opined that &quot;consultation&quot; in the context
			<lb />
			means an effective consultation and sharing of complete data
			<lb />
			on the basis of which transfer is sought to be effected but
			<lb />
			concluded that -After an effective consultation with the Chief Justice of India, it
			<lb />
			is open to the President to arrive at a proper decision of the question whether a Judge
			<lb />
			should be transferred to another High Court because, what the Constitution requires is
			<lb />
			consultation with the Chief Justice, not his concurrence with the proposed transfer 142 .
			<lb />
			After recording such a conclusion, His Lordship went on to
			<lb />
			observe as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;41. …….. But it is necessary to reiterate what Bhagwati and
			<lb />
			Krishna Iyer JJ. said in Shamsher Singh (supra) that in all
			<lb />
			conceivable cases, consultation with the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			should be accepted by the Government of India and that the Court
			<lb />
			will have an opportunity to examine if any other extraneous
			<lb />
			circumstances have entered into the verdict of the executive if it
			<lb />
			departs from the counsel given by the Chief Justice of India. &quot;In
			<lb />
			practice the last word in such a sensitive subject must belong to the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India, the rejection of his advice being ordinarily
			<lb />
			regarded as prompted by oblique considerations vitiating the
			<lb />
			order.&quot; (page 873). It is hoped that these words will not fall on deaf
			<lb />
			ears and since normalcy has now been restored, the differences, if
			<lb />
			any, between the executive and the judiciary will be resolved by
			<lb />
			mutual deliberation each, party treating the views of the other with
			<lb />
			respect and consideration.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			41. Justice Bhagwati, was entirely in agreement with what has been said by
			<lb />
			Krishna Iyer in his judgment. 143
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			42. Justice Krishna Iyer spoke for himself and for Justice
			<lb />
			Fazal Ali. Justice Krishna Iyer, while reiterating the views
			<lb />
			expressed by this Court in two earlier judgments, i.e.
			<lb />
			Chandramouleshwar Prasad v. Patna High Court and Ors. ,
			<lb />
			(1969) 3 SCC 56 and Samsher Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR
			<lb />
			1974 SC 2192, opined that although the opinion of the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			may not be binding on the Government it is entitled to great weight and is normally to be
			<lb />
			accepted by the Government ………. 144 with a caveat:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;115. ……. It must also be borne in mind that if the Government
			<lb />
			departs from the opinion of the Chief Justice of India it has to
			<lb />
			justify its action by giving cogent and convincing reasons for the
			<lb />
			same and, if challenged, to prove to the satisfaction of the Court
			<lb />
			that a case was made out for not accepting the advice of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India. It seems to us that the word &apos;consultation&apos; has been
			<lb />
			used in Article 222 as a matter of constitutional courtesy in view of
			<lb />
			the fact that two very high dignitaries are concerned in the matter,
			<lb />
			namely, the President and the Chief Justice of India. Of course, the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice has no power of veto, as Dr. Ambedkar explained in
			<lb />
			the Constituent Assembly.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Justice Untwalia agreed with the views expressed by Justice
			<lb />
			Chandrachud on the question of consultation with the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India and added:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;125. ……… The Government, however, as rightly conceded by
			<lb />
			Mr. Seervai, is not bound to accept and act upon the advice of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice. It may differ from him and for cogent reasons may
			<lb />
			take a contrary view. In other words, as held by this Court in the
			<lb />
			case of Chandramouleshwar Prasad v. Patna High Court and Ors.
			<lb />
			[1970]2SCR666 , the advice is not binding on the Government
			<lb />
			invariably and as a matter of compulsion in law. Although the
			<lb />
			decision of this Court in Chandramouleshwar Prasad&apos;s case was
			<lb />
			with reference to the interpretation of Articles 233 and 235 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, on principle there is hardly any difference.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			43. One interesting factor that is required to be noted from
			<lb />
			the abovementioned case is that all the 16 transfers were made
			<lb />
			in consultation with the then CJI. Within a year thereafter, in
			<lb />
			March 1977, general elections took place and a new political
			<lb />
			party came to power. The Government on a re-examination of
			<lb />
			the matter opined that there was no justification for
			<lb />
			transferring Justice Sheth from Gujarat. It is a matter of
			<lb />
			history that all 16 Judges who were transferred during
			<lb />
			emergency, were sent back to their parent High Courts along
			<lb />
			with Justice Sheth 145 . This fact is significant in the context of
			<lb />
			the argument that permitting the executive to have any say in
			<lb />
			the matter of appointment of Judges to Constitutional Courts
			<lb />
			would be destructive of independence of the judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			44. Within three years thereafter, another significant event in
			<lb />
			the constitutional history of this country occurred. The then
			<lb />
			Law Minister of the Government of India sent a circular dated
			<lb />
			145 Per Fazal Ali, J. -S.P. Gupta case, p.403 -&quot;It is true that there were, quite a few transfers during the
			<lb />
			emergency which were not in consonance with the spirit of Article 222 and that is why the Government had
			<lb />
			conceded this fact and took steps to revoke the transfers by retransferring, almost all the Judges to the High
			<lb />
			Courts from where they had been transferred.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Page 493
			<lb />
			18 th March 1981 to Chief Ministers of various States. Chief
			<lb />
			Ministers were requested to obtain from all the Additional
			<lb />
			Judges (working in the concerned High Courts) consent to be
			<lb />
			appointed as permanent Judges in any other High Court in the
			<lb />
			country. It also advised Chief Ministers to obtain similar
			<lb />
			consent letters from persons who have already been or may in
			<lb />
			future be proposed for initial appointment as Judges of the
			<lb />
			High Court. The said letter was challenged in S.P. Gupta case
			<lb />
			on the ground it was a direct attack on the independence of the judiciary which
			<lb />
			is a basic feature of the Constitution 146 (Para 2). The matter was heard by
			<lb />
			seven Judges of this Court. Seven separate judgments were
			<lb />
			delivered. One of the questions before this Court was whether
			<lb />
			the opinion of CJI be given primacy over the opinion of other
			<lb />
			constitutional functionaries. Substantially, this Court took the
			<lb />
			same view as was taken in Sankalchand case 147 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			45. Growth of population, increasing awareness of legal
			<lb />
			rights in the population, expansion of the scope of judicial
			<lb />
			review as a consequence of a change in the understanding of
			<lb />
			the amplitude of various fundamental rights and their
			<lb />
			inter-relationship, a sea change in the law on the procedural
			<lb />
			146 Para 2 of S.P. Gupta case -Bhagwati, J.
			<lb />
			147 See paras 30 &amp; 31 -Bhagwati, J.; Para 134 -Gupta, J., Para 632 -Tulzapurkar, J.; Para 726 -Desai, J.
			<lb />
			Paras 890 &amp; 891 -Pathak, J.; Paras 1031 &amp; 1032 -E S Venkataramaiah,J
			<lb />
			limitations in the exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 32
			<lb />
			and 226 led to the explosion of dockets of the CONSTITUTIONAL
			<lb />
			COURTS of this country. But, the Judge strength remained
			<lb />
			relatively stagnant. By 80s, the problem became more acute
			<lb />
			and complex.
			<lb />
			Government of India did not undertake the
			<lb />
			requisite exercise to make a periodic assessment of the need to
			<lb />
			increase the judge strength. In the case of some High Courts,
			<lb />
			there was even a reduction 148 . Even, the appointment process
			<lb />
			of High Court Judges was taking unreasonably long periods on
			<lb />
			legally untenable grounds 149 . A three Judge Bench of this
			<lb />
			Court in Subhash Sharma v. Union of India (1991) Supp.1 SCC
			<lb />
			574 (for short Subhash Sharma case) took note of such a
			<lb />
			situation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			46. There was a turmoil with regard to appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges of CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS in 1970s and 1980s. Senior
			<lb />
			Judges were superceded for appointment to the office of CJI.
			<lb />
			Perhaps, emboldened by judgments of this Court in
			<lb />
			148 Subhash Sharma v. Union of India, 1991 Supp (1) SCC 574, at page 586 :
			<lb />
			Para 18. &quot;We gather that the Kerala High Court where the sanctioned strength has been reduced
			<lb />
			by 2, has a sanctioned strength of 22 while its pendency as on January 1, 1990 being 34,330 cases justifies a
			<lb />
			Judge strength of almost 50 on the basis of the measure of 650 cases per Judge per year. We intend to
			<lb />
			indicate that there was no justification for reduction of the sanctioned strength.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			149 Para 19. &quot;For the present we suggest to government that the matter should be reviewed from time to
			<lb />
			time and steps should be taken for determining the sanctioned strength in a pragmatic way on the basis of
			<lb />
			the existing need. If there be no correlation between the need and the sanctioned strength and the provision
			<lb />
			of Judge-manpower is totally inadequate, the necessary consequence has to be backlog and sluggish
			<lb />
			enforcement of the Rule of Law. ……&quot;
			<lb />
			Page 495
			<lb />
			Sankalchand and S.P. Gupta the executive (at the National as
			<lb />
			well as the State level) resorted to unhealthy manipulation of
			<lb />
			the system. The Informal Constitution : Unwritten Criteria in
			<lb />
			Selecting Judges for the Supreme Court of India 150 records some
			<lb />
			instances of such manipulations based on news items
			<lb />
			published in print media of some reputation by Commentators
			<lb />
			of well established credentials on Contemporary issues and
			<lb />
			scholars. It appears that out of 53 appointments of Judges to
			<lb />
			some High Courts made in 1984-85, 32 were made on the
			<lb />
			recommendations of acting Chief Justices. It is believed that
			<lb />
			the senior most Judges of some High Courts (from where the
			<lb />
			said 32 recommendations had originated) who initiated those
			<lb />
			recommendations as acting Chief Justices, were made
			<lb />
			permanent Chief Justices only after they agreed to recommend
			<lb />
			names suggested by the Executive. A particular Additional
			<lb />
			Judge was not confirmed as a permanent Judge for several
			<lb />
			years notwithstanding the recommendations for his
			<lb />
			confirmation by three successive Chief Justices of the High
			<lb />
			Court and three CJIs allegedly on the ground that the Judge
			<lb />
			had delivered a judgment not palatable to the State
			<lb />
			Government. It appears that the Government headed by Prime
			<lb />
			150 Abhinav Chandrachud, The Informal Constitution : Unwritten Criteria in Selecting
			<lb />
			Judges for the Supreme Court of India, (Oxford University Press, United Kingdom 2014)
			<lb />
			See Pages 113 to 120
			<lb />
			Page 496
			<lb />
			Minister V.P. Singh had stalled appointments of 67 persons
			<lb />
			recommended by the Chief Justices of various High Courts.
			<lb />
			Charges were freely traded against each other by the
			<lb />
			constitutional functionaries who are part of the appointment
			<lb />
			process of the CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS. It appears that a Law
			<lb />
			Minister for the Union of India complained that State
			<lb />
			Governments were trying to pack High Courts with their &apos;own
			<lb />
			men&apos; 151 . The basic facts are verifiable, inferences therefrom are
			<lb />
			perhaps contestable.
			<lb />
			Unfortunately, the correspondence
			<lb />
			between the Government and the CJI and the record of the
			<lb />
			consultation process are some of the best guarded secrets of
			<lb />
			this country.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			47. The question is not whether the various statements made
			<lb />
			in the above-mentioned book are absolutely accurate. The
			<lb />
			observations made by this Court in Subhash Sharma case can
			<lb />
			lead to a safe conclusion, that there must be some truth in the
			<lb />
			various statements made in the book. The above scenario
			<lb />
			whether true or partially true formed the backdrop of the
			<lb />
			observations made in Subhash Sharma case (supra). As a
			<lb />
			151 From 1978, Governments at the State level and the Union level ceased to be necessarily of the same
			<lb />
			political party. Regional parties in parts of the country had captured power putting an end to one party rule
			<lb />
			at both the levels.
			<lb />
			consequence, the Bench thought it fit that the correctness of
			<lb />
			S.P. Gupta case should be considered by a larger Bench.
			<lb />
			&quot;49. …….. majority view in S.P. Gupta&apos;s case should be
			<lb />
			considered by a larger Bench we direct the papers of W.P. No. 1303
			<lb />
			of 1987 to be placed before the learned Chief Justice for
			<lb />
			constituting a Bench of nine Judges to examine the two questions
			<lb />
			we have referred to above, namely, the position of the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India with reference to primacy and, secondly, justiciability of
			<lb />
			fixation of Judge strength…….&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			48. This led to the Second Judges case. The matter was
			<lb />
			heard by nine Judges.
			<lb />
			Five separate judgments were
			<lb />
			delivered. Justice Verma spoke for five of them. Justice
			<lb />
			Pandian and Justice Kuldip Singh wrote separate judgments
			<lb />
			but agreed with the conclusions of Justice Verma, but Justice
			<lb />
			Ahmadi and Justice Punchhi did not. One proposition on
			<lb />
			which all nine Judges were unanimous is that under the
			<lb />
			scheme of the Constitution, independence of judiciary is
			<lb />
			indispensable. Justice Verma categorically held that it is a part
			<lb />
			of the basic structure of the Constitution 152 . The point of
			<lb />
			disagreement between the majority and minority is only
			<lb />
			152 Para 421 -These questions have to be considered in the context of the independence of the judiciary, as
			<lb />
			a part of the basic structure of the Constitution, to secure the &apos;rule of law&apos;, essential for the preservation of
			<lb />
			the democratic system. The broad scheme of separation of powers adopted in the Constitution, together with
			<lb />
			the directive principle of &apos;separation of judiciary from executive&apos; even at the lowest strata, provides some
			<lb />
			insight to the true meaning of the relevant provisions in the Constitution relating to the composition of the
			<lb />
			judiciary. The construction of these provisions must accord with these fundamental concepts in the
			<lb />
			constitutional scheme to preserve the vitality and promote the growth essential for retaining the Constitution
			<lb />
			as a vibrant organism.
			<lb />
			Page 498
			<lb />
			regarding the mode by which the establishment and
			<lb />
			continuance of such an independent judiciary can be achieved.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			49. Textually, provisions which indicate that the judiciary is
			<lb />
			required to be independent of the executive are Article 50 153
			<lb />
			and the form of oath required to be taken by the Judges of
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS prescribed in Forms IV 154 and VIII 155
			<lb />
			under the Third Schedule to the Constitution of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			50. However, structurally there are many indications in the
			<lb />
			scheme of the Constitution which lead to an unquestionable
			<lb />
			inference that the Framers of the Constitution desired to have
			<lb />
			a judiciary which is absolutely independent of the Executive
			<lb />
			and insulated from vagaries of transient and shifting
			<lb />
			majoritarian dynamics. Under the scheme of the Constitution,
			<lb />
			State Legislatures have absolutely no role in matters
			<lb />
			pertaining to the establishment of CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS of
			<lb />
			153
			<lb />
			Article 50. Separation of judiciary from executive -&quot;The State shall take steps to separate the
			<lb />
			judiciary from the executive in the public services of the State.&quot;

			this country.
			<lb />
			Parliament alone is authorized to deal with
			<lb />
			certain aspects of the establishment of the CONSTITUTIONAL
			<lb />
			COURTS and their administration such as fixation of the
			<lb />
			strength of the courts, salaries and other service conditions of
			<lb />
			the judges etc. Termination of an appointment made to a
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTIONAL COURT can be done only through the process
			<lb />
			of impeachment by Parliament, the only legislative body
			<lb />
			authorised to impeach by following a distinct legislative
			<lb />
			process only on the ground of &apos;proved misbehaviour or incapacity&apos;. Such
			<lb />
			a process is made more stringent by a constitutional
			<lb />
			stipulation under Article 124(5) 156 that the procedure for
			<lb />
			investigation and proof of misbehaviour or incapacity of a
			<lb />
			Judge must be regulated by law. Even after misbehaviour or
			<lb />
			incapacity is established removal of a Judge is not automatic
			<lb />
			but subject to voting and approval by a special majority of the
			<lb />
			Parliament specified under Article 124(4) 157 . Prior to the
			<lb />
			AMENDMENT, the power to appoint Judges of CONSTITUTIONAL
			<lb />
			COURTS vested in the President to be exercised in consultation
			<lb />
			with the various constitutional functionaries mentioned under
			<lb />
			156 Article 124(5). Parliament may by law regulate the procedure for the presentation of an address and for
			<lb />
			the investigation and proof of the misbehaviour or incapacity of a Judge under clause (4).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			157 Article 124(4). A Judge of the Supreme Court shall not be removed from his office except by an order of
			<lb />
			the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total
			<lb />
			membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two thirds of the members of that House
			<lb />
			present and voting has been presented to the President in the same session for such removal on the ground
			<lb />
			of proved misbehaviour or incapacity.
			<lb />
			Articles 124 and 217, as the case may be. Consultation with
			<lb />
			the CJI was mandatory for the appointment of Judges of all
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS. Consultation with the Chief Justices
			<lb />
			of High Courts was mandatory for appointment of Judges of
			<lb />
			High Courts.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			51. In the backdrop of such scheme, a question arose
			<lb />
			whether the appointment process, in any way, impacts
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary, which, admittedly, formed a
			<lb />
			part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Majority of the
			<lb />
			Judges opined that it does 158 . Their Lordships drew support for
			<lb />
			158 (per Hon. Pandian, J.) -Para 49. &quot;one other basic and inseparable vital condition is absolutely
			<lb />
			necessary for timely securing the independence of judiciary; and that concerns the methodology followed in
			<lb />
			the matter of sponsoring, selecting and appointing a proper and fit candidate to the (Supreme Court or High
			<lb />
			Court) higher judiciary. The holistic condition is a major component that goes along with other
			<lb />
			constitutionally guaranteed service conditions in securing a complete independence of judiciary. To say
			<lb />
			differently, a healthy independent judiciary can be said to have been firstly secured by accomplishment of
			<lb />
			the increasingly important condition in regard to the method of appointment of judges and, secondly,
			<lb />
			protected by the fulfilment of the rights, privileges and other service conditions. The resultant inescapable
			<lb />
			conclusion is that only the consummation or totality of all the requisite conditions beginning with the
			<lb />
			method and strategy of selection and appointment of judges will secure and protect the independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary. Otherwise, not only will the credibility of the judiciary stagger and decline but also the entire
			<lb />
			judicial system will explode which in turn may cripple the proper functioning of democracy and the
			<lb />
			philosophy of this cherished concept will be only a myth rather than a reality.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(per Hon. Kuldip Singh, J.) -Para 335. &quot;Then the question which comes up for consideration is,
			<lb />
			can there be an independent judiciary when the power of appointment of judges vests in the
			<lb />
			executive? To say yes, would be illogical. The independence of judiciary is inextricably linked and
			<lb />
			connected with the constitutional process of appointment of judges of the higher judiciary. &apos;Independence of
			<lb />
			Judiciary&apos; is the basic feature of our Constitution and if it means what we have discussed above, then the
			<lb />
			Framers of the Constitution could have never intended to give this power to the executive. Even otherwise
			<lb />
			the Governments -Central or the State -are parties before the Courts in large number of cases. The
			<lb />
			Union Executive have vital interests in various important matters which come for adjudication before the
			<lb />
			Apex Court. The executive -in one form or the other -is the largest single litigant before the courts. In
			<lb />
			this view of the matter the judiciary being the mediator -between the people and the executive -the
			<lb />
			Framers of the Constitution could not have left the final authority to appoint the Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court and of the High Courts in the hands of the executive.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(per Hon. Verma, J.) -Para 447. &quot;When the Constitution was being drafted, there was
			<lb />
			general agreement that the appointments of Judges in the superior judiciary should not be left to the
			<lb />
			absolute discretion of the executive, and this was the reason for the provision made in the Constitution
			<lb />
			imposing the obligation to consult the Chief Justice of India and the Chief Justice of the High Court. This
			<lb />
			was done to achieve independence of the Judges of the superior judiciary even at the time of their
			<lb />
			appointment, instead of confining it only to the provision of security of tenure and other conditions of
			<lb />
			Page 501
			<lb />
			such conclusion from history and debates in the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly apart from the observations made in the cases of
			<lb />
			Sankalchand and S.P. Gupta. Their Lordships also took note of
			<lb />
			the fact that the Constituent Assembly consciously excluded
			<lb />
			any role to the Parliament in the process of appointments, a
			<lb />
			conscious departure from the American Constitutional model
			<lb />
			where Federal Judicial appointments are subject to consent of
			<lb />
			the Senate.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			52. In the background of such an analysis, consultation with the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India in Articles 124 and 217 was interpreted as
			<lb />
			conferring primacy to the opinion of CJI. Consultation with
			<lb />
			the CJI was part of a design of the Constituent Assembly to
			<lb />
			deny unfettered authority (to the union executive) to appoint
			<lb />
			Judges of the CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS.
			<lb />
			The Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly did not choose to vest such controlling power in the
			<lb />
			Parliament to which the Executive is otherwise accountable
			<lb />
			service after the appointment was made. It was realised that the independence of the judiciary had to be
			<lb />
			safeguarded not merely by providing security of tenure and other conditions of service after the
			<lb />
			appointment, but also by preventing the influence of political considerations in making the
			<lb />
			appointments, if left to the absolute discretion of the executive as the appointing authority. It is this reason
			<lb />
			which impelled the incorporation of the obligation of consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of the High Court in Articles 124(2) and 217(1). The Constituent Assembly Debates disclose
			<lb />
			this purpose in prescribing for such consultation, even though the appointment is ultimately an executive
			<lb />
			act.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Page 502
			<lb />
			under the scheme of the Constitution. This Court, therefore,
			<lb />
			concluded that without primacy to the opinion of CJI the
			<lb />
			whole consultation process contemplated under Articles 124
			<lb />
			and 217 would only become ornamental enabling the executive
			<lb />
			to make appointments in its absolute discretion, most likely
			<lb />
			based on considerations of political expediency.
			<lb />
			Such a
			<lb />
			process would be antithetical to the constitutional goal of
			<lb />
			establishing an independent judiciary.
			<lb />
			However, Justice
			<lb />
			Verma categorically declared-
			<lb />
			&quot;438. The debate on primacy is intended to determine, who
			<lb />
			amongst the constitutional functionaries involved in the integrated
			<lb />
			process of appointments is best equipped to discharge the greater
			<lb />
			burden attached to the role of primacy, of making the proper
			<lb />
			choice; and this debate is not to determine who between them is
			<lb />
			entitled to greater importance or is to take the winner&apos;s prize at
			<lb />
			the end of the debate. The task before us has to be performed with
			<lb />
			this perception.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			450. …………. The indication is, that in the choice of a
			<lb />
			candidate suitable for appointment, the opinion of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India should have the greatest weight; the selection
			<lb />
			should be made as a result of a participatory consultative process
			<lb />
			in which the executive should have power to act as a mere check
			<lb />
			on the exercise of power by the Chief Justice of India, to
			<lb />
			achieve the constitutional purpose. Thus, the executive element
			<lb />
			in the appointment process is reduced to the minimum and any
			<lb />
			political influence is eliminated. It was for this reason that the
			<lb />
			word &apos;consultation&apos; instead of &apos;concurrence&apos; was used, but that was
			<lb />
			done merely to indicate that absolute discretion was not given to
			<lb />
			any one, not even to the Chief Justice of India as individual,
			<lb />
			much less to the executive, which earlier had absolute discretion
			<lb />
			under the Government of India Acts.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			[emphasis supplied]
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			53. This Court also indicated the circumstances on which the
			<lb />
			President of India would be constitutionally justified in not
			<lb />
			acting in accordance with the opinion expressed by the CJI.
			<lb />
			This Court never held that consultation means concurrence as is
			<lb />
			sought to be interpreted in some quarters and I regret to say
			<lb />
			even in the stated objects and reasons for the AMENDMENT.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;As regards the appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court and
			<lb />
			High Courts, the Supreme Court, in the matters of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of India and its
			<lb />
			Advisory Opinion 1998 in Third Judges case, had interpreted
			<lb />
			articles 124(2) and 217(1) of the Constitution with respect to the
			<lb />
			meaning of &quot;consultation&quot; as &quot;concurrence&quot;. It was also held
			<lb />
			that the consultation of the Chief Justice of India means collegium
			<lb />
			consisting of the Chief Justice and two or four Judges, as the case
			<lb />
			may be. This has resulted in a Memorandum of Procedure laying
			<lb />
			down the process which is being presently followed for
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to both the High Courts and the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court. The Memorandum of Procedure confers upon the Judiciary

		</p>
		<p>
			55. After some 20 years of the working of the regime created
			<lb />
			under the Second Judges case, serious questions arose
			<lb />
			whether the regime emanating as a consequence of the
			<lb />
			interpretation placed by this Court in the Second Judges case,
			<lb />
			yielded any constitutionally aspired result of the establishment
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			an
			<lb />
			independent
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			efficient
			<lb />
			judiciary
			<lb />
			-
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTINONAL COURTS. Answer regarding the independence
			<lb />
			159 See the articles of Lord Templeman&apos;s favourable opinion and the critical view of Lord Cooke of
			<lb />
			Thorndon published in the book titled Supreme but not Infallible -Oxford University Press -
			<lb />
			2000 A.D.
			<lb />
			&quot;Article 124 of the Constitution empowers the President (acting on the advice of the
			<lb />
			Prime Minister and Cabinet) to appoint the judges of the Supreme Court. The President is given a
			<lb />
			discretion about consulting judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts but in the case of
			<lb />
			appointments of a Judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of India shall always be
			<lb />
			consulted. Similarly, Article 217 requires the Chief Justice of India to be consulted concerning the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge of the High Court of a state. In 1993, in the Supreme Court Advocates on
			<lb />
			Record Association case the Supreme Court by a majority held that, having regard to the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers which the Court held to be implicit in
			<lb />
			the Constitution, the views of the Chief Justice of India expressed when he was consulted must be
			<lb />
			supreme. The Court also laid down guidelines governing the appointment and duration of office of
			<lb />
			temporary acting judges. The majority decision has been criticized as an extension of the meaning
			<lb />
			of the word &apos;consultation&apos;. However, having regard to the earlier experience in India of attempts by
			<lb />
			the executive to influence the personalities and attitudes of members of the judiciary, and having
			<lb />
			regard to the successful attempts made in Pakistan to control the judiciary and having regard to the
			<lb />
			unfortunate results of the appointment of Supreme Court judges of the United States by the
			<lb />
			President subject to approval by Congress, the majority decision of te Supreme Court of India in the
			<lb />
			Advocates on Record case marks a welcome assertion of the independence of the judiciary and is
			<lb />
			the best method of obtaining appointments of integrity and quality, a precedent method which the
			<lb />
			British could follow such advantage.&quot;

			<lb />
			&quot;All in all, the opinion of the Supreme Court in the third Judges case must be one of the
			<lb />
			most remarkable rulings ever issued by a supreme national appellate court in the coomon law world.
			<lb />
			Since, in some respects, I have had to voice respectful doubts about the soundness of the
			<lb />
			constitutional foundations of that opinion….&quot;
			<lb />

			can be subjective, and efficiency perhaps may not be very
			<lb />
			pleasant.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			56. Within a few years doubts arose regarding the true
			<lb />
			purport of the Second Judges case. The President of India
			<lb />
			invoked Article 143 and sought certain clarifications on the
			<lb />
			judgment of the Second Judges case leading to the opinion of
			<lb />
			this Court reported in Special Reference No.1 of 1998, (1998) 7
			<lb />
			SCC 739 (hereinafter referred to as &apos;Third Judges case&apos;).
			<lb />
			Unfortunately, the factual matrix on which doubts were
			<lb />
			entertained by the Government of India are not recorded in the
			<lb />
			opinion. But para 41 of the Third Judges case records:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;41. …We take the optimistic view that successive Chief
			<lb />
			Justices of India shall henceforth act in accordance with the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case and this opinion.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			57. No wonder, gossip and speculations gather momentum
			<lb />
			and currency in such state of affairs. If a nine-Judge Bench of
			<lb />
			this Court takes an optimistic view that successive Chief Justices of India shall
			<lb />
			henceforth act in accordance with the Second Judges case, the only logical
			<lb />
			inference that can be drawn is that the law laid down by the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case was not faithfully followed by the
			<lb />
			successive Chief Justices, if not in all at least in some cases
			<lb />
			attracting
			<lb />
			comments.
			<lb />
			Instead
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			Ministers,
			<lb />
			Judges
			<lb />
			patronised. 160
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			58. In the next one and a half decade, this nation has
			<lb />
			witnessed many unpleasant events connected with judicial
			<lb />
			appointments -events which lend credence to the speculation
			<lb />
			that the system established by the Second and Third Judges
			<lb />
			cases in its operational reality is perhaps not the best system
			<lb />
			for securing an independent and efficient judiciary. 161
			<lb />
			59. Two events are part of the record of this Court and can be
			<lb />
			quoted without attracting the accusation of being irresponsible
			<lb />
			and unconcerned about the sanctity of the institution. These
			<lb />
			events led to the decisions reported in Shanti Bhushan &amp;
			<lb />
			Another v. Union of India &amp; Another, (2009) 1 SCC 657, P.D.
			<lb />

			<lb />
			&quot;As I have said elsewhere &apos;the process by which a judge is appointed to a superior court is one of
			<lb />
			the best kept secrets in this country. The very secrecy of the process leads to an inadequate input of
			<lb />
			information as to the abilities and suitability of a possible candidate for appointment as a judge. A chance
			<lb />
			remark, a rumour or even third-hand information may be sufficient to damn a judge&apos;s prospects.
			<lb />
			Contrariwise a personal friendship or unspoken obligation may colour a recommendation. Consensus
			<lb />
			within the collegium is sometimes resolved through a trade-off resulting in dubious appointments with
			<lb />
			disastrous consequences for the litigants and the credibility of the judicial system. Besides, institutional
			<lb />
			independence has also been compromised by growing sycophancy and &apos;lobbying&apos; within the system.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Page 507
			<lb />
			While the 1 st of the said two events pertains to the
			<lb />
			appointment of a Judge of the Madras High Court, the 2 nd
			<lb />
			pertains to the recommendation made by the CJI (Collegium)
			<lb />
			regarding elevation of the Chief Justice of a High Court to this
			<lb />
			Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			60. The dispute in Shanti Bhushan case (supra) was
			<lb />
			regarding appointment of a permanent Judge to the Madras
			<lb />
			High Court. The allegation appears to be that the procedure
			<lb />
			indicated in the Second and Third Judges cases had not been
			<lb />
			followed. I use the expression appears to be because it is difficult
			<lb />
			to identify what was the exact pleading in the case 162 . It is only
			<lb />
			by inference such a conclusion can be reached. Even the
			<lb />
			conclusion recorded by this Court does not really throw any
			<lb />
			light. In para 22 of the judgment of this Court it is recorded as
			<lb />
			follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;22. The position is almost undisputed that on 17.3.2005 the then
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India recommended for extension of term of 8 out of
			<lb />
			9 persons named as Additional Judges for a further period of four
			<lb />
			months w.e.f. 3.4.2005. On 29.4.2005 the collegium including the
			<lb />
			then Chief Justice of India was of the view that name of Respondent
			<lb />
			2 cannot be recommended along with another Judge for confirmation
			<lb />
			as permanent Judge. Since it is crystal clear that the Judges are not
			<lb />
			concerned with any political angle if there be any in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment as Additional Judge or permanent Judge; the then Chief
			<lb />
			162 Shanti Bhushan (supra) -Para 2. The primary ground urged is that the opinion of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India has to be formed collectively after taking into account the views of his senior colleagues who are
			<lb />
			required to be consulted by him for the formation of opinion and no appointment can be made unless it is in
			<lb />
			conformity with the final opinion of the Chief Justice of India formed in the aforesaid manner. …. It is,
			<lb />
			therefore, submitted that the appointment of Respondent No.2 as a permanent Judge as notified on 2.2.2007
			<lb />
			has no sanctity in law.
			<lb />
			Page 508
			<lb />
			Justice should have stuck to the view expressed by the collegium and
			<lb />
			should not have been swayed by the views of the Government to
			<lb />
			recommend extension of the term of Respondent 2 for one year; as it
			<lb />
			amounts to surrender of primacy by jugglery of words.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			[emphasis supplied]
			<lb />
			Even if I choose to ignore the controversial statements made
			<lb />
			(in the recent past) with regard to the appointment in question
			<lb />
			in the case, by persons who held high constitutional offices
			<lb />
			and played some role in the appointment process including
			<lb />
			former Members of this Court, the judgment leaves sufficient
			<lb />
			scope for believing that all did not go well with the
			<lb />
			appointment. It appears to have been a joint venture in the
			<lb />
			subversion of the law laid down by the Second and Third
			<lb />
			Judges cases by both the executive and the judiciary which
			<lb />
			neither party is willing to acknowledge.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			61. The grievance of the petitioners in that case appears to be
			<lb />
			that &quot;…. Collegium was not consulted. … .&quot; Unfortunately, there is no
			<lb />
			precise finding in this regard in the said judgment. On the
			<lb />
			other hand, the content of para 22 of the judgment leaves me
			<lb />
			with an uncomfortable feeling that there was some departure
			<lb />
			from the law perhaps under some political pressure. I wish
			<lb />
			that I were wrong.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			62. The second event is a recommendation made by the then
			<lb />
			CJI apparently with the concurrence of the Collegium for
			<lb />
			elevation of the petitioner. [See: P.D. Dinakaran (1) (supra); P.D.
			<lb />
			Dinakaran (2) (supra)]. The recommendation did not fructify.
			<lb />
			Serious allegations of unsuitability of the candidate whose
			<lb />
			name was recommended surfaced leading to a great deal of
			<lb />
			public debate. It is unpleasant to recount those allegations.
			<lb />
			They are recorded in the abovementioned two judgments.
			<lb />
			There is no allegation of any failure on the part of the
			<lb />
			Collegium to comply with the procedure laid down in Second
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			Third Judges
			<lb />
			cases in
			<lb />
			making
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			ill-fated
			<lb />
			recommendation. But, the recommendation certainly exposed
			<lb />
			the shallowness (at least for once) of the theory propounded by
			<lb />
			this Court in the trilogy of cases commencing from S.P. Gupta
			<lb />
			and ending with the Third Judges case that the CJI and the
			<lb />
			Collegium are the most appropriate authorities to make an
			<lb />
			assessment of the suitability of candidates for appointment as
			<lb />
			Judges of CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS in this country. A few more
			<lb />
			instances were mentioned at the bar during the course of
			<lb />
			hearing to demonstrate not only the shallowness of the theory
			<lb />
			but also the recommendations by the Collegium have not
			<lb />
			necessarily always been in the best interests of the institution
			<lb />
			and the nation. It is not really necessary to place on record
			<lb />
			all the details but it is sufficient to mention that the earlier
			<lb />
			mentioned two cases are not certainly the only examples of the
			<lb />
			inappropriate exercise of the power of the Collegium.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			63. I am aware that a few bad examples of the improper
			<lb />
			exercise of the power does not determine the character of the
			<lb />
			power. Such inappropriate exercise of the power was resorted
			<lb />
			to also by the Executive already noticed earlier. Both branches of
			<lb />
			government are accusing each other of not being worthy of trust. 163
			<lb />
			At least a
			<lb />
			section of the civil society believes that both are right. The
			<lb />
			impugned AMENDMENT came in the backdrop of the
			<lb />
			above-mentioned experience.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			64. Independence of the judiciary is one of the basic features
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. A seven-Judge Bench of this Court in L
			<lb />
			Chandra Kumar v. Union of India &amp; Ors., (1997) 3 SCC 261
			<lb />
			already held that the power of judicial review of legislative
			<lb />
			action by the CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS is part of the basic
			<lb />
			163 Mehta, Pratap Bhanu, &apos;Whom do you trust&apos;, The Indian Express, May 14, 2015 -&quot;The implicit constitutional
			<lb />
			accusation is this. The judiciary had, through improvisation, created a method of appointing judges that effectively
			<lb />
			sidelined other branches of government. This arrangement was tolerated, not because it conformed to a constitutional
			<lb />
			text or some hallowed principle, but because it seemed to maintain judicial independence. The experience of the 1970s
			<lb />
			made the prospect of political packing of the judiciary a live fear. This arrangement is being challenged, not because we
			<lb />
			have discovered a new principle, but because the credibility of the judiciary has declined. We are, in effect, saying that
			<lb />
			any arrangement that relies solely on the judiciary has proved untrustworthy. Those challenging the NJAC are relying
			<lb />
			on the ghost of the 1970s: Do you really want the political class to have a greater say in appointments? Both branches of
			<lb />
			government are accusing each other of not being worthy of trust. In the process, they have dragged each other down.
			<lb />
			The problem is that both are right.&quot;
			<lb />
			Page 511
			<lb />
			structure of the constitution and the exercise of such
			<lb />
			important function demands the existence of an independent
			<lb />
			judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;78. The legitimacy of the power of courts within constitutional
			<lb />
			democracies to review legislative action has been questioned since
			<lb />
			the time it was first conceived. The Constitution of India, being
			<lb />
			alive to such criticism, has, while conferring such power upon the
			<lb />
			higher judiciary, incorporated important safeguards. An analysis
			<lb />
			of the manner in which the Framers of our Constitution
			<lb />
			incorporated provisions relating to the judiciary would indicate that
			<lb />
			they were very greatly concerned with securing the independence
			<lb />
			of the judiciary. These attempts were directed at ensuring that the
			<lb />
			judiciary would be capable of effectively discharging its wide powers
			<lb />
			of judicial review. While the Constitution confers the power to
			<lb />
			strike down laws upon the High Courts and the Supreme Court, it
			<lb />
			also contains elaborate provisions dealing with the tenure,
			<lb />
			salaries, allowances, retirement age of Judges as well as the
			<lb />
			mechanism for selecting Judges to the superior courts. The
			<lb />
			inclusion of such elaborate provisions appears to have been
			<lb />
			occasioned by the belief that, armed by such provisions, the
			<lb />
			superior courts would be insulated from any executive or
			<lb />
			legislative attempts to interfere with the making of their
			<lb />
			decisions. The Judges of the superior courts have been entrusted with
			<lb />
			the task of upholding the Constitution and to this end, have been
			<lb />
			conferred the power to interpret it. It is they who have to ensure that
			<lb />
			the balance of power envisaged by the Constitution is maintained and
			<lb />
			that the legislature and the executive do not, in the discharge of their
			<lb />
			functions, transgress constitutional limitations. It is equally their duty
			<lb />
			to oversee that the judicial decisions rendered by those who man the
			<lb />
			subordinate courts and tribunals do not fall foul of strict standards of
			<lb />
			legal correctness and judicial independence. The constitutional
			<lb />
			safeguards which ensure the independence of the Judges of the
			<lb />
			superior judiciary, are not available to the Judges of the subordinate
			<lb />
			judiciary or to those who man tribunals created by ordinary
			<lb />
			legislations. Consequently, Judges of the latter category can never be
			<lb />
			considered full and effective substitutes for the superior judiciary in
			<lb />
			discharging the function of constitutional interpretation. We,
			<lb />
			therefore, hold that the power of judicial review over legislative
			<lb />
			action vested in the High Courts under Article 226 and in this
			<lb />
			Court under Article 32 of the Constitution is an integral and
			<lb />
			essential feature of the Constitution, constituting part of its basic
			<lb />
			structure. Ordinarily, therefore, the power of High Courts and
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court to test the constitutional validity of
			<lb />
			legislations can never be ousted or excluded.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			[emphasis supplied]
			<lb />
			This aspect of the matter is not in issue. None of the
			<lb />
			respondents contested that proposition. The text of the
			<lb />
			Constitution bears ample testimony for the proposition that
			<lb />
			the Constitution seeks to establish and nurture an
			<lb />
			independent judiciary. The makers of the Constitution were
			<lb />
			eloquent about it. Various Articles of the Constitution seek to
			<lb />
			protect independence of the judiciary by providing appropriate
			<lb />
			safeguards against unwarranted interference either by the
			<lb />
			Legislature or the Executive, with the Judges conditions of
			<lb />
			service and privileges incidental to the membership of the
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS, such as, salary, pension, security of
			<lb />
			tenure of the office etc. The scheme of the Constitution in that
			<lb />
			regard is already noticed. 164
			<lb />
			Such protections are felt
			<lb />
			necessary not only under our Constitution, but also several
			<lb />
			other democratic Constitutions (the details of some of them are
			<lb />
			already noticed in paras 25 to 27). Such protections are
			<lb />
			incorporated in the light of the experience and knowledge of
			<lb />
			history. Various attempts made by Governments to subvert
			<lb />
			the independence of the judiciary were known to the makers of
			<lb />
			those Constitutions and also the makers of our Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			65. Articles 124 and 217 deal with one of the elements
			<lb />
			necessary to establish an independent judiciary -the
			<lb />
			appointment process.
			<lb />
			The Constituent Assembly was fully
			<lb />
			conscious of the importance of such an element in establishing
			<lb />
			and nurturing an independent judiciary. It examined various
			<lb />
			models in vogue in other countries. Dr. Ambedkar&apos;s speech
			<lb />
			dated 24 th May 1949 165 (quoted supra) is proof of such
			<lb />
			awareness. The Constituent Assembly was fully appraised of
			<lb />
			the dangers of entrusting the power of appointment of
			<lb />
			members of the CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS exclusively to the
			<lb />
			Executive. At the same time, the Constituent Assembly was
			<lb />
			also sensitised to the undesirability of entrusting such a power
			<lb />
			exclusively to the CJI or allowing any role to the Parliament in
			<lb />
			the matter of the judicial appointments. The probable
			<lb />
			consequences of assigning such a role were also mentioned by
			<lb />
			Dr. Ambedkar.
			<lb />
			The Constituent Assembly was informed of
			<lb />
			the various models and institutional mechanisms in vogue
			<lb />
			under various democratic Constitutions for appointment of the
			<lb />
			members of the superior judiciary. The Constituent Assembly
			<lb />
			was told by Dr. Ambedkar that the model, such as the one
			<lb />
			contained in Articles 124 and 217 (as they stood prior to the
			<lb />
			AMENDMENT) -may be regarded as sufficient for the moment. Various
			<lb />
			alternative models suggested by the members were not
			<lb />
			accepted. 166 The legislative history clearly indicates that the
			<lb />
			members of the Constituent Assembly clearly refused to vest
			<lb />
			an absolute and unfettered power to appoint Judges of the
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS in any one of the 3 branches of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly declined to assign any
			<lb />
			role to the Parliament. It declined to vest an unbridled power
			<lb />
			in the executive.
			<lb />
			At the same time did not agree with the
			<lb />
			166 On 24 th May 1949 while draft Article 103 of the draft Constitution was being discussed corresponding to
			<lb />
			present Article 124, four members, Prof. Shibban Lal Saksena and Prof. K.T. Shah, who represented the
			<lb />
			United Provinces of Bihar and Mr. B. Pocker Sahib and Mr. Mahboob Ali Beig Sahib, who represented
			<lb />
			Madras Provinces suggested amendments to Article 103, the relevant portions of which read as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Prof. Shibban Lal Saksena:
			<lb />
			That for clause (2) of article 103, the following clauses be substituted-
			<lb />
			(2)
			<lb />
			The Chief Justice of Bharat, who shall be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, shall be
			<lb />
			appointed by the President subject to confirmation by two-thirds majority of Parliament assembled in a joint
			<lb />
			session of both the Houses of Parliament.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Prof. K.T. Shah:
			<lb />
			Every judge of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand
			<lb />
			and seal after consultation with the Council of States and such of the judges of the Supreme Court and of
			<lb />
			the High Courts in the States as may be necessary for the purpose and shall hold office until he attains the
			<lb />
			age of sixty-five years.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Mr. B. Pocker Sahib:
			<lb />
			That for clause (2) and the first proviso of clause (2) of article 103, the following be substituted-
			<lb />
			(2)
			<lb />
			Every judge of the Supreme Court other than the Chief Justice of India shall be appointed
			<lb />
			by the President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with the concurrence of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India; and the Chief Justice of India shall be appointed by the President by a warrant under his
			<lb />
			hand and seal after consultation with the judges of the Supreme Court and the Chief Justices of the High
			<lb />
			Court in the States and every judge of the Supreme Court.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Mr. Mahboob Ali Beig Sahib:
			<lb />
			That in the first proviso to clause (2) of article 103, for the words &apos;the Chief Justice of India shall
			<lb />
			always be consulted&apos; the words &apos;it shall be made with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India&apos; be
			<lb />
			substituted.&quot;

			<lb />
			proposal that the CJI&apos;s concurrence is required for any

			appointment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			66. The system of Collegium the product of an interpretative
			<lb />
			gloss on the text of Articles 124 and 217 undertaken in the
			<lb />
			Second and Third Judges case may or may not be the best to
			<lb />
			establish and nurture an independent and efficient judiciary.
			<lb />
			There are seriously competing views expressed by eminent
			<lb />
			people 167 , both on the jurisprudential soundness of the
			<lb />
			judgments and the manner in which the Collegium system
			<lb />
			operated in the last two decades.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			67. Neither the jurisprudential correctness of the concept of
			<lb />
			Collegium nor how well or ill the Collegium system operated in
			<lb />
			the last two decades is the question before us. The question is
			<lb />
			-whether such a system is immutable or is Parliament
			<lb />
			competent to amend the Constitution and create an alternative
			<lb />
			mechanism for selection and appointment of the members of
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS of this country.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			68. The basic objection for the impugned AMENDMENT is that
			<lb />
			it is destructive of the Constitutional objective of establishment
			<lb />
			of an independent judiciary, and consequently the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution. Therefore, it falls foul of the law
			<lb />
			laid down by this Court in Bharati case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			69. To decide the correctness of the submission, it is
			<lb />
			necessary:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(1) to identify the ratio decidendi of Bharati case where the
			<lb />
			theory of &quot;basic structure&quot; and &quot;basic features&quot;
			<lb />
			originated.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(2) Whether the expressions &quot;basic features&quot; and &quot;basic
			<lb />
			structure&quot; of the Constitution are synonyms or do they
			<lb />
			convey different ideas or concepts? If so, what are the
			<lb />
			ideas they convey?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(3) Have they been clearly identified by earlier decisions of
			<lb />
			this Court?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(4) Are there any principles of law laid down by this Court to
			<lb />
			identify the basic features of the Constitution?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(5) If the two expressions &quot;basic features&quot; and &quot;basic
			<lb />
			structure&quot; mean two different things, is it the destruction
			<lb />
			of any one of them which renders any Constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment void or should such an amendment be
			<lb />
			destructive of both of them to become void.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(6) When can a Constitutional amendment be said to destroy
			<lb />
			or abrogate either a &quot;basic feature&quot; of the Constitution or
			<lb />
			the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			70. In Bharati case, one of the questions was -whether
			<lb />
			Article 368 confers unbridled power on the Parliament to
			<lb />
			amend the Constitution.
			<lb />
			That question arose in the
			<lb />
			background of an earlier decision of this Court in I.C. Golak
			<lb />
			Nath &amp; Others v. State of Punjab &amp; Another, (1967) 2 SCR
			<lb />
			762 168 wherein it was held that Article 368 conferred on
			<lb />
			Parliament a limited power to amend the Constitution. A
			<lb />
			Constitutional amendment is &apos;law&apos; within the meaning of
			<lb />
			Article 13(3)(a) 169 . Any Constitutional amendment which seeks
			<lb />
			to take away or even abridge any one of the rights guaranteed
			<lb />
			under Part-III of the Constitution would be violative of the
			<lb />
			mandate contained under Article 13(2) 170 and therefore illegal.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			71. The correctness of I.C. Golak Nath was one of the
			<lb />
			questions which fell for consideration of the larger Bench of
			<lb />
			this Court in Bharati case. Eleven opinions were rendered.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			168 Heard by a Bench of 11 Judges and decided by a majority of 6:5
			<lb />
			169 Article 13(3)(a). &quot;law&quot; includes any Ordinance, order, bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or
			<lb />
			usage having in the territory of India the force of law.
			<lb />
			170 Article 13(2). The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by
			<lb />
			this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void.
			<lb />
			Page 518
			<lb />
			This Court by majority held that every Article of the
			<lb />
			Constitution including the articles incorporating fundamental
			<lb />
			rights are amenable to the amendatory power of the
			<lb />
			Parliament 171 under Article 368 which is a constituent power
			<lb />
			171
			<lb />
			(Per Sikri, CJ) -Para 292, &quot;fundamental rights cannot be abrogated but reasonable abridgements
			<lb />
			of fundamental rights can be effected in public interest&quot;. … &quot;That every provision of the Constitution can
			<lb />
			be amended provided in the result the basic foundation and structure of the Constitution remains the
			<lb />
			same. The basic structure may be said to consist of the following features:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(1)
			<lb />
			Supremacy of the Constitution;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2)
			<lb />
			Republican and Democratic form of Government;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(3)
			<lb />
			Secular character of the Constitution;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(4)
			<lb />
			Separation of powers between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(5)
			<lb />
			Federal character of the Constitution.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(Per Shelat, J. who spoke for himself and Grover, J.) -Paras 582, 583, &quot;there can be no difficulty
			<lb />
			in discerning that the following can be regarded as the basic elements of the constitutional structure. These
			<lb />
			cannot be catalogued but can only be illustrated:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(1)
			<lb />
			The supremacy of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2)
			<lb />
			Republican and Democratic form of government and sovereignty of the country.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(3)
			<lb />
			Secular and federal character of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(4)
			<lb />
			Demarcation of power between the Legislature, the executive and the judiciary.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(5)
			<lb />
			The dignity of the individual secured by the various freedoms and basic rights in
			<lb />
			Part III and the mandate to build a welfare State contained in Part IV.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(6)
			<lb />
			The unity and the integrity of the Nation.&quot;
			<lb />
			and, therefore, &quot;the power under Article 368 is wide enough to permit amendment of each and
			<lb />
			every article … so long as its basic elements are not abrogated or denuded of their identity&quot;.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(Per Hegde, J, who also spoke for Mukherjea, J.) -Para 666, &quot;Parliament has no power to abrogate
			<lb />
			or emasculate the basic elements or fundamental features of the Constitution such as the sovereignty of
			<lb />
			India, the democratic character of our polity, the unity of the country, the essential features of the individual
			<lb />
			freedoms secured to the citizens.&quot; … and &quot;mandate to build a welfare State and egalitarian society.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(Per P. Jaganmohan Reddy, J.) -paras 1159, 1162, &quot;A sovereign democratic republic.
			<lb />
			Parliamentary democracy, the three organs of the State … constitute the basic structure.&quot; He further
			<lb />
			held that &quot;without either the fundamental rights or directive principles it cannot be democratic
			<lb />
			republic. Therefore, the power of amendment under Article 368 ….. is not wide enough to totally abrogate
			<lb />
			….. any one of the fundamental rights or other essential elements of the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution and destroy its identity&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(Per Khanna, J.) -para 1426,, &quot;the power under Article 368 does not take within its sweep the
			<lb />
			power to destroy the old Constitution&quot; … means &quot;the retention of the basic structure or framework of
			<lb />
			the old Constitution&quot; … &quot;it is not permissible to touch the foundation or to alter the basic institutional
			<lb />
			pattern.&quot; According to Justice Khanna, &quot;such limitations are inherent and implicit in the word
			<lb />
			&quot;amendment&quot;.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Page 519
			<lb />
			but such power does not enable Parliament to alter the basic structure or
			<lb />
			framework of the Constitution. 172
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			72. That is the origin of the theory of basic structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Justice Shelat and Grover, J. used the expression basic elements
			<lb />
			and held that they cannot be abrogated or denuded of their identity.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Justice Hegde and Mukherjea, J. used the expression basic
			<lb />
			elements or fundamental features and held that they cannot be
			<lb />
			abrogated or emasculated. Justice Jaganmohan Reddy used
			<lb />
			the expression essential elements of the basic structure and held that they
			<lb />
			cannot be abrogated thereby destroying the identity of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. Justice Sikri and Khanna, J. employed the
			<lb />
			expressions basic structure or framework, foundation, the basic institutional pattern,
			<lb />
			which is beyond the power of the Parliament under Article 368
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. Some of the learned Judges mentioned
			<lb />
			certain features which according to them constitute basic or
			<lb />
			essential features etc. of the Constitution. All of them were
			<lb />
			cautious to make it explicit that such features or elements
			<lb />
			mentioned by them are only illustrative but not exhaustive. In
			<lb />
			Minerva Mills Ltd. &amp; Ors. v. Union of India &amp; Ors., (1980) 3 SCC
			<lb />
			625, Justice Chandrachud, speaking for the majority of the
			<lb />
			Constitution Bench, observed that para No.2 of the summary
			<lb />
			signed by the nine Judges correctly reflects the majority view.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			12. The summary of the various judgments in Kesavananda
			<lb />
			Bharati (Supra) was signed by nine out of the thirteen Judges.
			<lb />
			Paragraph 2 of the summary reads to say that according to the
			<lb />
			majority, &quot;Article 368 does not enable Parliament to alter the
			<lb />
			basic structure or framework of the Constitution&quot;. Whether or
			<lb />
			not the summary is a legitimate part of the judgment, or is per
			<lb />
			incuriam for the scholarly reasons cited by authors, it is undeniable
			<lb />
			that it correctly reflects the majority view.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			[emphasis supplied]
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			73. Again in Waman Rao &amp; Ors. etc. etc. v. Union of India &amp;
			<lb />
			Ors., (1981) 2 SCC 362, Chief Justice Chandrachud speaking
			<lb />
			for another Constitution Bench observed:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The judgment of the majority to which seven out of the thirteen
			<lb />
			Judges were parties, struck a bridle path by holding that in the
			<lb />
			exercise of the power conferred by Article 368, the Parliament
			<lb />
			cannot amend the Constitution so as to damage or destroy the
			<lb />
			basic structure of the Constitution.&quot; (Para 15)
			<lb />
			[emphasis supplied]
			<lb />
			By then Justice Chandrachud had already expressed his
			<lb />
			opinion in Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain, (1975) Supp SCC
			<lb />
			1 as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;663. There was some discussion at the Bar as to which features
			<lb />
			of the Constitution form the basic structure of the Constitution
			<lb />
			according to the majority decision in the Fundamental Rights case.
			<lb />
			That, to me, is an inquiry both fruitless and irrelevant. The ratio of
			<lb />
			the majority decision is not that some named features of the
			<lb />
			Constitution are a part of its basic structure but that the power
			<lb />
			of amendment cannot be exercised so as to damage or destroy
			<lb />
			the essential elements or the basic structure of the Constitution,
			<lb />
			whatever these expressions may comprehend.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			[emphasis supplied]
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			The above passages, indicate that it is not very clear from
			<lb />
			Bharati case whether the expression basic structure, basic features and
			<lb />
			essential elements convey the same idea or different ideas.
			<lb />
			Therefore, it is necessary to examine some decisions where the
			<lb />
			legality of the constitutional amendments was considered by
			<lb />
			this Court subsequent to Bharati case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			74. The earliest of them is Indira Nehru Gandhi case (supra).
			<lb />
			By the Constitution 39 th Amendment Article 329A was
			<lb />
			inserted. Clauses (4) and (5) of the said Article sought to
			<lb />
			exclude the complaints of violation of the provisions of The
			<lb />
			Representation of the People Act, 1951 from scrutiny of any
			<lb />
			forum whatsoever in so far as such complaints pertain to the
			<lb />
			election of the Prime Minister or the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.
			<lb />
			The question whether such an amendment violated any one of
			<lb />
			the basic features of the Constitution arose. It was argued
			<lb />
			that the amendment was violative of four basic features of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. They are : (1) Democratic form of Government;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(2) Separation of Powers between the legislature, the executive
			<lb />
			and the judiciary; (3) the principle of Equality of all before the
			<lb />
			law; and (4) the concept of the rule of law. A Constitution
			<lb />
			Bench of this Court held that the impugned clauses were
			<lb />
			beyond the competence of the Parliament&apos;s power under Article
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			368. 173
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			75. Four out of the five Judges agreed upon the conclusion
			<lb />
			that the impugned amendment was destructive of the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution. Each one of the Judges opined
			<lb />
			that the impugned provision violated a distinct basic feature of
			<lb />
			the Constitution leading to the destruction of the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			76. In Minerva Mills case (supra), this Court once again was
			<lb />
			confronted with the problem of &quot;basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution&quot;. 174 By the Constitution (42 nd Amendment) Act
			<lb />
			among other things, Clauses (4) and (5) came to be added in
			<lb />
			Article 368 and Article 31-C came to be amended by
			<lb />
			173 The judgment in Indira Nehru Gandhi case (supra) is neatly summarised by Chandrachud, J. in Waman
			<lb />
			Rao case at para 15:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;15.……… in Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain Article 329-A(4) was held by the Court to be
			<lb />
			beyond the amending competence of the Parliament since, by making separate and special
			<lb />
			provisions as to elections to Parliament of the Prime Minister and the speaker, it destroyed the
			<lb />
			basic structure of the Constitution. Ray, C.J. based his decision on the ground that the 39th
			<lb />
			Amendment by which Article 329-A was introduced violated the Rule of Law (p. 418) (SCC p.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			44); Khanna, J. based his decision on the ground that democracy was a basic feature of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, that democracy contemplates that elections should be free and fair and that the clause
			<lb />
			in question struck at the basis of free and fair elections (pp. 467 and 471) (SCC pp. 87 and 91);
			<lb />
			Mathew, J. struck down the clause on the ground that it was in the nature of legislation ad
			<lb />
			hominem (p. 513) (SCC p. 127) and that it damaged the democratic structure of the Constitution
			<lb />
			(p. 515) (SCC p. 129); while one of us, Chandrachud, J., held that the clause was bad because it
			<lb />
			violated the Rule of Law and was an outright negation of the principle of equality which is a basic
			<lb />
			feature of the Constitution (pp. 663-65) (SCC p. 257).&quot;
			<lb />
			174 Para
		</item>
		<p>
			13. The question which we have to determine on the basis of the majority view in Kesavananda
			<lb />
			Bharati is whether the amendments introduced by Sections 4 and 55 of the Constitution (42nd Amendment)
			<lb />
			Act, 1976 damage the basic structure of the Constitution by destroying any of its basic features or
			<lb />
			essential elements.
			<lb />
			substituting certain words in the original Article. Chief Justice
			<lb />
			Chandrachud spoke for the majority of the Court and declared
			<lb />
			Sections 4 and 55 of the Constitution (42 nd Amendment) Act to
			<lb />
			be violative of the basic structure of the Constitution. Dealing
			<lb />
			with the amendment to Article 368, this Court held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Para 16. ….. The majority (in Bharati case) conceded to the
			<lb />
			Parliament the right to make alterations in the Constitution so long
			<lb />
			as they are within its basic framework. And what fears can that
			<lb />
			judgment raise or misgivings generate if it only means this and no
			<lb />
			more. The preamble assures to the people of India a polity whose
			<lb />
			basic structure is described therein as a Sovereign Democratic
			<lb />
			Republic; Parliament may make any amendments to the
			<lb />
			Constitution as it deems expedient so long as they do not damage
			<lb />
			or destroy India&apos;s sovereignty and its democratic, republican
			<lb />
			character. Democracy is not an empty dream. It is a meaningful
			<lb />
			concept whose essential attributes are recited in the preamble itself:
			<lb />
			Justice -social, economic and political; Liberty of thought,
			<lb />
			expression, belief, faith and worship; and Equality of status and
			<lb />
			opportunity. Its aim, again as set out in the preamble, is to promote
			<lb />
			among the people an abiding sense of &quot;fraternity assuring the
			<lb />
			dignity of the individual and the unity of the nation&quot;. The newly
			<lb />
			introduced clause (5) of Article 368 demolishes the very pillars on
			<lb />
			which the preamble rests by empowering the Parliament to exercise
			<lb />
			its constituent power without any &quot;limitation whatever&quot;. No
			<lb />
			constituent power can conceivably go higher than the sky-high
			<lb />
			power conferred by clause (5), for it even empowers the Parliament
			<lb />
			to &quot;repeal the provisions of this Constitution&quot;, that is to say, to
			<lb />
			abrogate the democracy and substitute for it a totally antithetical
			<lb />
			form of Government. That can most effectively be achieved,
			<lb />
			without calling a democracy by any other name, by a total denial of
			<lb />
			social, economic and political justice to the people, by
			<lb />
			emasculating liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and
			<lb />
			worship and by abjuring commitment to the magnificent ideal of a
			<lb />
			society of equals. The power to destroy is not a power to amend.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			[emphasis supplied]
			<lb />
			The issue arising from the amendment to Article 31-C was
			<lb />
			identified to be -whether the directive principles of the State Policy contained in
			<lb />
			Part-IV can have primacy over the fundamental rights contained in Part-III of the
			<lb />
			Constitution -because the 42 nd amendment sought to subordinate the
			<lb />
			fundamental rights conferred by Articles 14 and 19 to the directive principles. This
			<lb />
			Court formulated the question -whether such an amendment
			<lb />
			was within the amendatory power of the Parliament in view of
			<lb />
			the law laid down by this Court in Bharati case. The Court
			<lb />
			propounded that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;41. ….. It is only if the rights conferred by these two Articles are
			<lb />
			not a part of the basic structure of the Constitution that they can be
			<lb />
			allowed to be abrogated by a constitutional amendment. If they are
			<lb />
			a part of the basic structure, they cannot be obliterated out of
			<lb />
			existence in relation to a category of laws described in Article 31-C
			<lb />
			or, for the matter of that, in relation to laws of any description
			<lb />
			whatsoever, passed in order to achieve any object or policy
			<lb />
			whatsoever. This will serve to bring out the point that a total
			<lb />
			emasculation of the essential features of the Constitution is, by the
			<lb />
			ratio in Kesavananda Bharati, not permissible to the Parliament.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The Court finally reached the conclusion that the Parts III and
			<lb />
			IV of the Constitution are like two wheels of a chariot both
			<lb />
			equally important and held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;56.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			….. To give absolute primacy to one over the other is to
			<lb />
			disturb the harmony of the Constitution. This harmony and
			<lb />
			balance between the fundamental rights and directive principles
			<lb />
			is an essential feature of the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			[emphasis supplied]
			<lb />
			This Court concluded that the amendment to Article 31C is
			<lb />
			destructive of the basic structure as it abrogated the protection
			<lb />
			of Article 14 &amp; 19 against laws which fall within the ambit of
			<lb />
			the description contained in Article 31C.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			77. In Waman Rao case (supra), Article 31-A(1)(a) which came
			<lb />
			to be introduced by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act
			<lb />
			was challenged on the ground that it damages the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution. The said Article made a
			<lb />
			declaration that no law providing for acquisition by the State of
			<lb />
			any &apos;estate&apos; or of &apos;any rights therein&apos; etc. shall be deemed to be
			<lb />
			void on the ground that such law violated Articles 14, 19 and
			<lb />
			31 of the Constitution. In other words, though Articles 14, 19
			<lb />
			and 31 remain on the statute book, the validity of the category
			<lb />
			of laws described in Article 31-A(1)(a) cannot be tested on the
			<lb />
			anvil of Articles 14, 19 and 31. Dealing with the permissibility
			<lb />
			of such an amendment, the Court held as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;In any given case, what is decisive is whether, insofar as the
			<lb />
			impugned law is concerned, the rights available to persons affected
			<lb />
			by that law under any of the articles in Part III are totally or
			<lb />
			substantially withdrawn and not whether the articles, the
			<lb />
			application of which stands withdrawn in regard to a defined
			<lb />
			category of laws, continue to be on the statute book so as to be
			<lb />
			available in respect of laws of other categories. We must therefore
			<lb />
			conclude that the withdrawal of the application of Articles 14, 19
			<lb />
			and 31 in respect of laws which fall under clause (a) is total and
			<lb />
			complete, that is to say, the application of those Articles stands
			<lb />
			abrogated, not merely abridged, in respect of the impugned
			<lb />
			enactments which indubitably fall within the ambit of clause (a).
			<lb />
			We would like to add that every case in which the protection of a
			<lb />
			fundamental right is withdrawn will not necessarily result in
			<lb />
			damaging or destroying the basic structure of the Constitution. The
			<lb />
			question as to whether the basic structure is damaged or
			<lb />
			destroyed in any given case would depend upon which
			<lb />
			particular Article of Part III is in issue and whether what is
			<lb />
			withdrawn is quintessential to the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.&quot; (Para 14)
			<lb />
			[emphasis supplied]
			<lb />
			But this Court finally reached the conclusion that the
			<lb />
			Amendment did not damage or destroy the basic structure
			<lb />
			and, therefore, upheld the Amendment 175 . Such a conclusion
			<lb />
			was reached on the basis of the logic -
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;29. The First Amendment is aimed at removing social and
			<lb />
			economic disparities in the agricultural sector. It may happen that
			<lb />
			while existing inequalities are being removed, new inequalities
			<lb />
			may arise marginally and incidentally. Such marginal and
			<lb />
			incidental inequalities cannot damage or destroy the basic structure
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. It is impossible for any government, howsoever
			<lb />
			expertly advised, socially oriented and prudently managed, to
			<lb />
			remove every economic disparity without causing some hardship or
			<lb />
			injustice to a class of persons who also are entitled to equal
			<lb />
			treatment under the law. …..&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			This Court held that though the protection of Articles 14 and
			<lb />
			19 is totally abrogated, the withdrawal or abrogation of such
			<lb />
			protection does not necessarily result in damage or destruction
			<lb />
			of the basic structure of the Constitution. In other words, this
			<lb />
			Court held that if in the process of seeking to achieve a larger
			<lb />
			constitutional goal of removing social and economic disparities in the
			<lb />
			agricultural sector and effectuating the twin principles contained in
			<lb />
			Article 39(b) and (a) if new inequalities result marginally and
			<lb />
			incidentally they cannot be said to be destructive of the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			175 Para 31. For these reasons, we are of the view that the Amendment introduced by Section 4 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951 does not damage or destroy the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. The Amendment must, therefore, be upheld on its own merits.

			78. Both Minerva Mills and Waman Rao dealt with the
			<lb />
			abrogation of Articles 14 and 19 or absolute withdrawal of the
			<lb />
			protection of those fundamental rights with reference to
			<lb />
			certain classes of legislation. This Court held in the first of the
			<lb />
			above mentioned cases that such withdrawal amounted to
			<lb />
			abrogation of a basic feature and, therefore, destructive of the
			<lb />
			basic structure of the Constitution and in the second case this
			<lb />
			Court carved out an exception to the rule enunciated in
			<lb />
			Minerva Mills and held that such abrogation insofar as the law
			<lb />
			dealing with agrarian reforms did not destroy the basic
			<lb />
			structure. These cases only indicate that; (i) the expressions
			<lb />
			&apos;basic structure&apos; and &apos;basic features&apos; convey two different ideas,
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii) the basic features are COMPONENTS of basic structure. It
			<lb />
			also follows from these cases that either a particular Article or
			<lb />
			set of Articles can constitute a basic feature of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
			Amendment of one or some of the Articles
			<lb />
			constituting a basic feature may or may not result in the
			<lb />
			destruction of the basic structure of the Constitution. It all
			<lb />
			depends on the context.

			79. This Court in S.R. Bommai v. Union of India, (1994) 3 SCC
			<lb />
			1, recognised the concept of secularism as one of the basic
			<lb />
			features of the Constitution not because any one of the Articles
			<lb />
			of the Constitution made any express declaration to that effect
			<lb />
			but such a conclusion followed from the scheme of the various
			<lb />
			provisions of the Constitution. 176
			<lb />
			80. This Court in M. Nagaraj &amp; Others v. Union of India &amp;
			<lb />
			Others 177 , (2006) 8 SCC 212, deduced the principle that the
			<lb />
			process of identifying the basic features of the Constitution
			<lb />
			lies in the identification of some concepts which are beyond
			<lb />
			the words of any particular provision but pervade the scheme
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. Some of these concepts may be so
			<lb />
			important and fundamental as to qualify to be called essential
			<lb />
			features of the Constitution or part of the basic structure of
			<lb />
			the Constitution therefore not open to the amendment.
			<lb />
			This Court specified the process by which the basic features of
			<lb />
			the Constitution are to be identified. The Court held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;23. …. Therefore, it is important to note that the recognition
			<lb />
			of a basic structure in the context of amendment provides an
			<lb />
			insight that there are, beyond the words of particular provisions,
			<lb />
			systematic principles underlying and connecting the provisions
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. These principles give coherence to the
			<lb />
			Constitution and make it an organic whole. These principles are
			<lb />
			176 See paras 25 to 29 -Ahmadi, J., para 145 -Sawant, J., paras 183 to 186 -Ramaswamy, J., para 304 -

		<p>
			177 In this case, this Court had to decide the validity of the Constitution (Eighty Fifth) Amendment Act 2001
			<lb />
			by which Article 16(4A) was amended in the Constitution with retrospective effect. It provided a rule of
			<lb />
			reservation in the context of the promotion in the Government service. Such an amendment was challenged
			<lb />
			to be violative of the basic structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			part of constitutional law even if they are not expressly stated in the
			<lb />
			form of rules. An instance is the principle of reasonableness which
			<lb />
			connects Articles 14, 19 and 21. Some of these principles may be
			<lb />
			so important and fundamental, as to qualify as &quot;essential features&quot;
			<lb />
			or part of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution, that is to say,
			<lb />
			they are not open to amendment. However, it is only by linking
			<lb />
			provisions to such overarching principles that one would be able to
			<lb />
			distinguish essential from less essential features of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			24.
			<lb />
			The point which is important to be noted is that principles
			<lb />
			of federalism, secularism, reasonableness and socialism, etc. are
			<lb />
			beyond the words of a particular provision. They are systematic
			<lb />
			and structural principles underlying and connecting various
			<lb />
			provisions of the Constitution. They give coherence to the
			<lb />
			Constitution. They make the Constitution an organic whole. They
			<lb />
			are part of constitutional law even if they are not expressly stated in
			<lb />
			the form of rules.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			25.
			<lb />
			For a constitutional principle to qualify as an essential
			<lb />
			feature, it must be established that the said principle is a part of the
			<lb />
			constitutional law binding on the legislature. Only thereafter, is the
			<lb />
			second step to be taken, namely, whether the principle is so
			<lb />
			fundamental as to bind even the amending power of Parliament i.e.
			<lb />
			to form a part of the basic structure. The basic structure concept
			<lb />
			accordingly limits the amending power of Parliament. To sum up:
			<lb />
			in order to qualify as an essential feature, a principle is to be
			<lb />
			first established as part of the constitutional law and as such
			<lb />
			binding on the legislature. Only then, can it be examined whether
			<lb />
			it is so fundamental as to bind even the amending power of
			<lb />
			Parliament i.e. to form part of the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. This is the standard of judicial review of
			<lb />
			constitutional amendments in the context of the doctrine of basic
			<lb />
			structure.&quot;

			81. In I.R. Coelho (Dead) By LRs v. State of T.N. (2007) 2 SCC
			<lb />
			1, this Court ruled;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;129. Equality, rule of law, judicial review and separation of
			<lb />
			powers form parts of the basic structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			Each of these concepts are intimately connected. There can be no
			<lb />
			rule of law, if there is no equality before the law. These would be
			<lb />
			meaningless if the violation was not subject to the judicial review.
			<lb />
			All these would be redundant if the legislative, executive and
			<lb />
			judicial powers are vested in one organ. Therefore, the duty to
			<lb />
			decide whether the limits have been transgressed has been placed
			<lb />
			on the judiciary.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			130. Realising that it is necessary to secure the enforcement of
			<lb />
			the fundamental rights, power for such enforcement has been
			<lb />
			vested by the Constitution in the Supreme Court and the High
			<lb />
			Courts. Judicial Review is an essential feature of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			It gives practical content to the objectives of the Constitution
			<lb />
			embodied in Part III and other parts of the Constitution. It may be
			<lb />
			noted that the mere fact that equality, which is a part of the basic
			<lb />
			structure, can be excluded for a limited purpose, to protect certain
			<lb />
			kinds of laws, does not prevent it from being part of the basic
			<lb />
			structure. Therefore, it follows that in considering whether any
			<lb />
			particular feature of the Constitution is part of the basic
			<lb />
			structure -rule of law, separation of powers -the fact that limited
			<lb />
			exceptions are made for limited purposes, to protect certain kind of
			<lb />
			laws, does not mean that it is not part of the basic structure.&quot;

			<lb />
			cases commencing from Bharati case yields the following
			<lb />
			propositions:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Article 368 enables the Parliament to amend
			<lb />
			any provision of the Constitution;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) The power under Article 368 however does not
			<lb />
			enable the Parliament to destroy the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii) None of the cases referred to above specified or
			<lb />
			declared what is the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iv) The expressions &quot;basic structure&quot; and &quot;basic
			<lb />
			features&quot; convey different ideas though some of
			<lb />
			the learned Judges used those expressions
			<lb />
			interchangeably.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(v) The basic structure of the Constitution is the
			<lb />
			sum total of the basic features of the
			<lb />
			Constitution;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(vi) Some of the basic features identified so far by
			<lb />
			this Court are democracy, secularism, equality
			<lb />
			of status, independence of judiciary, judicial
			<lb />
			review and some of the fundamental rights;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(vii) The abrogation of any one of the basic features
			<lb />
			results normally in the destruction of the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution subject to some
			<lb />
			exceptions;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(viii) As to when the abrogation of a particular basic
			<lb />
			feature can be said to destroy the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution depends upon the
			<lb />
			nature of the basic feature sought to be
			<lb />
			amended and the context of the amendment.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			There is no universally applicable test vis-à-vis
			<lb />
			all the basic features.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			83. Most of the basic features identified so far in the various
			<lb />
			cases referred to earlier are not emanations of any single
			<lb />
			Article of the Constitution. They are concepts emanating from
			<lb />
			a combination of a number of Articles each of them creating
			<lb />
			certain rights or obligations or both (for the sake of easy
			<lb />
			reference I call them &quot;ELEMENTS&quot;). For example,
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) when it is said that the democracy is a basic feature of
			<lb />
			our Constitution, such a feature, in my opinion, emerges
			<lb />
			from the various articles of the Constitution which
			<lb />
			provide for the establishment of the legislative bodies 178
			<lb />
			(Parliament and the State Legislatures) and the Articles
			<lb />
			which prescribe a periodic election to these bodies 179
			<lb />
			based on adult franchise 180 ; the role assigned to these
			<lb />
			bodies, that is, to make laws for the governance of this
			<lb />
			Country in their respective spheres 181 ; and
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			establishment of an independent machinery 182 for
			<lb />
			conducting the periodic elections etc.;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) the concept of secularism emanates from various
			<lb />
			articles contained in the fundamental rights chapter like
			<lb />
			Articles 15 and 16 which prohibits the State from
			<lb />
			practicing any kind of discrimination on the ground of
			<lb />
			religion and Articles 25 to 30 which guarantee certain
			<lb />
			fundamental rights regarding the freedom of religion to
			<lb />
			every person and the specific mention of such rights with
			<lb />
			reference to minorities.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			84. The abrogation of a basic feature may ensue as a
			<lb />
			consequence of the amendment of a single Article in the
			<lb />
			cluster of Articles constituting the basic feature as it happened
			<lb />
			in Minerva Mills case and Indira Nehru Gandhi case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			85. On the other hand, such a result may not ensue in the
			<lb />
			context of some basic features. For
			<lb />
			example,
			<lb />
			Article
			<lb />
			326
			<lb />
			prescribes that election to Lok Sabha and the Legislative
			<lb />
			Assemblies shall be on the basis of adult suffrage. Adult
			<lb />
			suffrage is explained in the said Article as:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;… that is to say, every person who is a citizen of India and who is
			<lb />
			not less than eighteen years of age on such date as may be fixed in
			<lb />
			that behalf by or under any law made by the appropriate
			<lb />
			Legislature and is not otherwise disqualified under this
			<lb />
			Constitution or any law made by the appropriate Legislature on the
			<lb />
			ground of non-residence, unsoundness of mind, crime or corrupt or
			<lb />
			illegal practice, shall be entitled to be registered as a voter at any
			<lb />
			such election.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			One of the components is that the prescription of the
			<lb />
			minimum age limit of 18 years. Undoubtedly, the right created
			<lb />
			under Article 326 in favour of citizens of India to participate in
			<lb />
			the election process of the Lok Sabha and the Legislative
			<lb />
			Assemblies is an integral part (for the sake of convenience, I
			<lb />
			call it an ELEMENT) of the basic feature i.e. democracy.
			<lb />
			However, for some valid reasons, if the Parliament were to
			<lb />
			amend Article 326 fixing a higher minimum age limit, it is
			<lb />
			doubtful whether such an amendment would be abrogative of
			<lb />
			the basic feature of
			<lb />
			democracy thereby resulting in the
			<lb />
			destruction of the basic structure of the Constitution. It is
			<lb />
			worthwhile remembering that the minimum age of 18 years
			<lb />
			occurring under Article 326 as on today came up by way of the
			<lb />
			Constitution (Sixty-first Amendment) Act, 1988. Prior to the
			<lb />
			amendment, the minimum age limit was 21 years.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			86. As held by this Court in Minerva Mills case, the
			<lb />
			amendment of a single article may result in the destruction of
			<lb />
			the basic structure of the Constitution depending upon the
			<lb />
			nature of the basic feature and the context of the abrogation of
			<lb />
			that article if the purpose sought to be achieved by the Article
			<lb />
			constitutes the quintessential to the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			87. In my opinion, these cases also are really of no help for
			<lb />
			determining the case on hand as they do not lay down any
			<lb />
			general principle by which it can be determined as to when can
			<lb />
			a constitutional amendment be said to destroy the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution. In the case on hand, the
			<lb />
			identity of the basic feature is not in dispute. The question is
			<lb />
			whether the AMENDMENT is abrogative of the independence of
			<lb />
			judiciary -(a basic feature) resulting in the destruction of the
			<lb />
			basic structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			88. By the very nature of the basic feature with which we are
			<lb />
			dealing, it does not confer any fundamental or constitutional
			<lb />
			right in favour of individuals. It is only a means for securing to
			<lb />
			the people of India, justice, liberty and equality. It creates a
			<lb />
			collective right in favour of the polity to have a judiciary which
			<lb />
			is free from the control of the Executive or the Legislature in its
			<lb />
			essential function of decision making.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			89. The challenge to the AMENDMENT is required to be
			<lb />
			examined in the light of the preceding discussion.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			petitioners argued that (i) Independence of the judiciary is a
			<lb />
			basic feature (COMPONENT) of the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution; (ii) the process of appointment of members of
			<lb />
			constitutional courts is an essential ingredient (ELEMENT) of
			<lb />
			such COMPONENT; (iii) the process prescribed under unamended
			<lb />
			Articles 124 and 217, as interpreted by this Court in the
			<lb />
			Second and Third Judges cases, is a basic feature and was so
			<lb />
			designed by framers of the Constitution for ensuring
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary, by providing for primacy of the
			<lb />
			opinion of the CJI (Collegium); and not of the opinion of the
			<lb />
			President (the Executive); (iv) the AMENDMENT dilutes such
			<lb />
			primacy and tilts the balance in favour of the Executive,
			<lb />
			thereby abrogating a basic feature, leading to destruction of
			<lb />
			the basic structure.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			90. The prime target of attack by the petitioners is Section
			<lb />
			2(a) of the AMENDMENT by which the institutional mechanism
			<lb />
			for appointment of judges of constitutional courts is replaced.
			<lb />
			According to the petitioners, the AMENDMENT is a brazen
			<lb />
			attempt by the Executive branch to grab the power of
			<lb />
			appointing Judges to CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS. Such shift of
			<lb />
			power into the hands of Executive would enable packing of the
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS with persons who are likely to be less
			<lb />
			independent.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			91. It is further argued that the principles laid down in the
			<lb />
			Second and Third Judges cases are not based purely on the
			<lb />
			interpretation of the text of the Constitution as it stood prior to
			<lb />
			the impugned AMENDMENT but also on the basis of a
			<lb />
			fundamental Constitutional principle that an independent
			<lb />
			judiciary is one of the basic features of the Constitution. The
			<lb />
			procedure for appointment of the Judges of the
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS is an important element in the
			<lb />
			establishment and nurturing of an independent judiciary.
			<lb />
			Such conclusion not only flows from the text of the Articles
			<lb />
			124 and 217 as they stood prior to the impugned AMENDMENT
			<lb />
			but flow from a necessary implication emanating from the
			<lb />
			scheme of the Constitution as evidenced by Articles 32, 50,
			<lb />
			112(3)(d), 113(1), 203(1), 125(2), 221(2) etc.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			92. Mr. Nariman, learned Senior Counsel appearing for one of
			<lb />
			the petitioners emphatically submitted that he is not against
			<lb />
			change of the mechanism provided under Articles 124 and
			<lb />
			217.
			<lb />
			He submitted that this aspect of the matter fell for
			<lb />
			consideration of Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah Commission 183 ,
			<lb />
			which also recommended creation of a National Judicial
			<lb />
			Appointments Commission but with a slightly different
			<lb />
			composition 184 . If really Parliament wanted to change in the
			<lb />
			183 The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC), 2002 chaired by
			<lb />
			Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah
			<lb />
			184 7.3.7 &quot;The matter relating to manner of appointment of judges had been debated over a decade. The
			<lb />
			Constitution (Sixty-seventh Amendment) Bill, 1990 was introduced on 18 th May, 1990 (9 th Lok Sabha)
			<lb />
			providing for the institutional frame work of National Judicial Commission for recommending the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges to the Supreme Court and the various High Courts. Further, it appears that latterly
			<lb />
			there is a movement throughout the world to move this function away from the exclusive fiat of the
			<lb />
			executive and involving some institutional frame work whereunder consultation with the judiciary at some
			<lb />
			level is provided for before making such appointments. The system of consultation in some form is already
			<lb />
			Page 538
			<lb />
			mechanism for the selection of the members of the superior
			<lb />
			judiciary, the model recommended by the Justice M.N.
			<lb />
			Venkatachaliah Commission could well have been adopted.
			<lb />
			According to Mr. Nariman the model identified by
			<lb />
			Venkatachaliah Commission is more suitable for preservation
			<lb />
			of independence of the judiciary than the model adopted in the
			<lb />
			AMENDMENT. Mr. Nariman further argued that no reasons
			<lb />
			are given by the Union of India explaining why
			<lb />
			recommendations of the Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah
			<lb />
			Commission were not accepted.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			93. On the other hand, it is submitted by the learned
			<lb />
			Attorney General and other senior counsel appearing for
			<lb />
			various respondents;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Parliament&apos;s power to amend the Constitution
			<lb />
			is plenary subject only to the limitation that it
			<lb />
			available in Japan, Israel and the UK. The Constitution (Sixty-seventh Amendment) Bill, 1990 provided for
			<lb />
			a collegium of the Chief Justice of India and two other judges of the Supreme Court for making
			<lb />
			appointment to the Supreme Court. However, it would be worthwhile to have a participatory mode with the
			<lb />
			participation of both the executive and the judiciary in making such recommendations. The Commission
			<lb />
			proposes the composition of the Collegium which gives due importance to and provides for the effective
			<lb />
			participation of both the executive and the judicial wings of the State as an integrated scheme for the
			<lb />
			machinery for appointment of judges. This Commission, accordingly, recommends the establishment of a
			<lb />
			National Judicial Commission under the Constitution.
			<lb />
			The National Judicial Commission for appointment of judges of the Supreme Court shall
			<lb />
			comprise of:
			<lb />
			1.
			<lb />
			The Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			Chairman
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			2.
			<lb />
			Two senior most judges of the Supreme Court:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Member
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3
			<lb />
			The Union Minister for Law and Justice:
			<lb />
			Member
			<lb />
			4
			<lb />
			One eminent person nominated by the President after consulting the CJI
			<lb />
			Member
			<lb />
			The recommendation for the establishment of a National Judicial Commission and its
			<lb />
			composition are to be treated as integral in view of the need to preserve the independence of the judiciary.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Page 539
			<lb />
			cannot abrogate the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
			The AMENDMENT in no way
			<lb />
			abrogates the basic structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii) Independence of judiciary is not the only
			<lb />
			objective envisaged by the Constitution, it also
			<lb />
			envisages an efficient judiciary. To achieve such
			<lb />
			twin objects, Parliament in its wisdom thought that
			<lb />
			the selection process of the members of the
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS as it existed prior to the
			<lb />
			AMENDMENT required modification. The wisdom of
			<lb />
			Parliament is not amenable to the scrutiny of this
			<lb />
			Court, even in the context of ordinary legislation.
			<lb />
			Logically, a constitutional amendment therefore
			<lb />
			should enjoy a greater degree of immunity.
			<lb />
			In other words, where the goal sought to be achieved
			<lb />
			by Parliament is constitutionally legitimate, the
			<lb />
			legislation by which such a goal is sought to be
			<lb />
			achieved can be questioned only on limited grounds.
			<lb />
			They are (i) lack of legislative competence, (ii) the
			<lb />
			legislation violates any one of the fundamental
			<lb />
			rights enumerated in Part III of the Constitution, or
			<lb />
			is in contravention of some other express
			<lb />
			prohibition of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			Absent such
			<lb />
			objectionable features, the possibility that the goal
			<lb />
			sought to be achieved by the legislation can be
			<lb />
			achieved through modes other than the one chosen
			<lb />
			by the legislation can never be a ground for
			<lb />
			invalidating even an ordinary legislation as has been
			<lb />
			consistently held by this Court.
			<lb />
			In the case of a
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment question of legislative
			<lb />
			competence in the above-mentioned sense and
			<lb />
			conflict with the other provisions of the Constitution
			<lb />
			are irrelevant and does not arise.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii) Checks and balances of powers conferred by the
			<lb />
			Constitution on the three great branches of
			<lb />
			governance -Legislature, Executive and Judiciary is
			<lb />
			the most basic feature of all democratic
			<lb />
			constitutions. Absolute independence of any one of
			<lb />
			the three branches is inconsistent with core
			<lb />
			democratic values and the scheme of our
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
			This Court by an interpretative
			<lb />
			process of the Constitution as it stood prior to the
			<lb />
			AMENDMENT disturbed such balance.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			AMENDMENT only seeks to restore such balance and
			<lb />
			therefore cannot be said to be destructive of the
			<lb />
			basic structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv) That the law laid down by this Court in Second
			<lb />
			and Third Judges case is no more relevant in view of
			<lb />
			the fact that the text of the Constitution which was
			<lb />
			the subject matter of interpretation in the said cases
			<lb />
			stands amended.
			<lb />
			In the light of well settled
			<lb />
			principles of interpretation of statutes the law laid
			<lb />
			down in those two cases is no more a good law. It is
			<lb />
			further argued that in the event this Court comes to
			<lb />
			the conclusion that the law laid down in the
			<lb />
			abovementioned two judgments has some relevance
			<lb />
			for determining the constitutional validity of the
			<lb />
			AMENDMENT and also the correctness of the
			<lb />
			principles laid down in those judgments requires
			<lb />
			reconsideration by a Bench of appropriate strength.
			<lb />
			According to the Attorney General and other learned
			<lb />
			counsel for respondents, the abovementioned two
			<lb />
			judgments are contrary to the text of the
			<lb />
			Constitution as it stood then and in complete
			<lb />
			disregard of the constitutional history and
			<lb />
			background of the relevant provisions. It is further
			<lb />
			submitted that under the scheme of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, neither this Court nor High Courts are
			<lb />
			conferred unqualified autonomy though a large
			<lb />
			measure of autonomy is conferred under various
			<lb />
			provisions. For example the salaries, privileges and
			<lb />
			allowances, pension etc. could still be regulated by
			<lb />
			law made by Parliament under Article 125 and 221,
			<lb />
			137, 140, 145 etc.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(v) It is submitted that independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary is indisputably a basic feature of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. An essential element of this basic
			<lb />
			feature is that the President (Executive) should not
			<lb />
			have an unfettered discretion in such appointment
			<lb />
			process but not that the opinion of the CJI
			<lb />
			(Collegium) should have primacy or dominance. The
			<lb />
			judgments of this Court in the Second and Third
			<lb />
			Judges cases are not only counter textual but also
			<lb />
			plainly contrary to the intent of the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly and clearly beyond limits of judicial
			<lb />
			power, it is an exercise of constituent authority in
			<lb />
			the disguise of interpretation.
			<lb />
			Under the
			<lb />
			AMENDMENT, the President has no discretion in the
			<lb />
			matter of appointment of Judges of CONSTITUTIONAL
			<lb />
			COURTS. He is bound by the recommendation of the
			<lb />
			NJAC wherein members of the judiciary constitute
			<lb />
			the single largest group.
			<lb />
			Parliament exercising
			<lb />
			constituent power (under Article 368) considered it
			<lb />
			appropriate that representatives of the Civil Society
			<lb />
			should be accorded a participatory role in the
			<lb />
			process of appointments to CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS
			<lb />
			and that their presence would be a check on
			<lb />
			potential and consequently ruinous &apos;trade offs&apos;; (i)
			<lb />
			between and amongst the three members
			<lb />
			representing the judiciary and (ii) between the
			<lb />
			judiciary and the executive; and would accentuate
			<lb />
			transparency to what had hitherto been an opaque
			<lb />
			process. Such wisdom of the Parliament in not open
			<lb />
			to question.
			<lb />
			It is an established and venerated
			<lb />
			principle that the Court would not sit in judgment
			<lb />
			over the wisdom of Parliament even in respect of an
			<lb />
			ordinary legislation; a constitutional amendment
			<lb />
			invites a greater degree of deference.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vi) Even under the scheme of the AMENDMENT,
			<lb />
			judiciary has a pre-dominant role. The apprehension
			<lb />
			that, under the new dispensation, Executive would
			<lb />
			have
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			opportunity
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			packing
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS of this country with
			<lb />
			cronies is illogical and baseless. The presence of
			<lb />
			three senior most Judges of this Court in the NJAC
			<lb />
			is a wholesome safeguard against such possibility.
			<lb />
			Any two of the three Judges can stall such an effort,
			<lb />
			if ever attempted by the Executive.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vii) The fact that a Commission headed by Justice
			<lb />
			M.N.Venkatachaliah made certain recommendations
			<lb />
			need not necessarily mean that the model suggested
			<lb />
			by the Commission is the only model for securing
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary or the best model. At
			<lb />
			any rate, the choice of the appropriate model
			<lb />
			necessarily involves a value judgment. The model
			<lb />
			chosen by the Parliament in exercise of its
			<lb />
			constituent powers cannot be held to be
			<lb />
			unconstitutional only on the ground that in the
			<lb />
			opinion of some, there are better models or
			<lb />
			alternatives. Such a value judgment is exclusively
			<lb />
			in the realm of the Parliament&apos;s constituent powers.
			<lb />
			It is also argued that the mechanism for selection of
			<lb />
			members
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			the constitutional courts
			<lb />
			as
			<lb />
			expounded in the Second and the Third Judges
			<lb />
			cases, even according to Mr. Nariman&apos;s opinion is
			<lb />
			not the best. Mr. Nariman is on record stating so in
			<lb />
			one of the books authored by him &quot;Before Memory
			<lb />
			Fades : An Autobiography&quot; 185 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			94. Any appointment process established under the
			<lb />
			Constitution must necessarily be conducive for establishment
			<lb />
			of not only an independent judiciary but also ensure its
			<lb />
			efficiency. Two qualities essential for preservation of liberty.
			<lb />
			&quot;In order to lay a due foundation for that separate and
			<lb />
			distinct exercise of the different powers of government,
			<lb />
			which to a certain extent is admitted on all hands to be
			<lb />
			essential to the preservation of liberty, it is evident that
			<lb />
			each department should have a will of its own, and
			<lb />
			185 Fali S. Nariman, Before Memory Fades -An Autobiography,
			<lb />
			p. 389 -&quot;If there is one important case decided by the Supreme Court of India in which I appeared
			<lb />
			and won, and which I have lived to regret, it is the decision that goes by the title -Supreme Court
			<lb />
			Advocates-on-Record Association vs Union of India. It is a decision of the year 1993 and is better known as
			<lb />
			the Second Judges Case.&quot;
			<lb />
			p.400 -&quot;I don&apos;t see what is so special about the first five judges of the Supreme Court. They are
			<lb />
			only the first five in seniority of appointment -not necessarily in superiority of wisdom or competence. I
			<lb />
			see no reason why all the judges in the highest court should not be consulted when a proposal is made for
			<lb />
			appointment of a high court judge (or an eminent advocate) to be a judge of the Supreme Court. I would
			<lb />
			suggest that the closed-circuit network of five judges should be disbanded. They invariably hold their
			<lb />
			&apos;cards&apos; close to their chest. They ask no one. They consult no one but themselves.&quot;
			<lb />
			consequently should be so constituted that the members
			<lb />
			of each should have as little agency as possible in the
			<lb />
			appointment of the members of the others. Were this
			<lb />
			principle rigorously adhered to, it would require that all
			<lb />
			the appointments for the supreme executive, legislative,
			<lb />
			and judiciary magistracies should be drawn from the
			<lb />
			same fountain of authority, the people, through channels
			<lb />
			having no communication whatever with one another.
			<lb />
			Some difficulties, and some additional expense would
			<lb />
			attend the execution of it. Some deviations, therefore, from
			<lb />
			the principle must be admitted. In the constitution of the
			<lb />
			judiciary department in particular, it might be
			<lb />
			inexpedient to insist rigorously on the principle: first,
			<lb />
			because peculiar qualifications being essential in the
			<lb />
			members, the primary consideration ought to be to
			<lb />
			select that mode of choice which best secures these
			<lb />
			qualifications.&quot; 186
			<lb />
			[emphasis supplied]
			<lb />
			Judges who could decide causes brought before them
			<lb />
			expeditiously and consistent with applicable principles of
			<lb />
			jurisprudence, generate confidence, in litigants and the polity
			<lb />
			that they indeed dispense justice. Whether the appointment
			<lb />
			process prior to the AMENDMENT yielded such appointments
			<lb />
			has been deeply contentious. As submitted by the learned
			<lb />
			Attorney
			<lb />
			General,
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			history
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			appointments
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS in our Republic could be divided into
			<lb />
			two phases -pre and post Second Judges case. No doubt
			<lb />
			during both phases, the appointment process yielded mixed
			<lb />
			results, on the index of both independence and efficiency.
			<lb />
			Some outstanding and some not so outstanding persona came
			<lb />
			to be appointed in both phases. Allegations of seriously
			<lb />
			unworthy appointments abound but our system provides for
			<lb />
			no mechanism for audit or qualitative analysis. Such systemic
			<lb />
			deficit has pathological consequences.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			95. Parliament representing the majoritarian will was
			<lb />
			satisfied that the existing process warrants change and acted
			<lb />
			in exercise of its constituent power and concomitant
			<lb />
			discretion. Such constituent assessment of the need is clearly
			<lb />
			off limits to judicial review. Whether curative ushered in by
			<lb />
			the AMENDMENT transgresses the permissible limits of
			<lb />
			amendatory power is certainly amenable to Judicial Review
			<lb />
			because of the law declared in Bharati case and followed
			<lb />
			consistently thereafter.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			96. The text and scheme of the AMENDMENT excludes
			<lb />
			discretion to the President in making appointments to
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS and the President is required to accept
			<lb />
			recommendations by the NJAC.
			<lb />
			The amended Articles
			<lb />
			stipulate that judges of CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS shall be appointed by
			<lb />
			the President ……. on the recommendation of the NJAC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			97. Prior to the AMENDMENT, there were only two parties to
			<lb />
			the appointment process, the Executive and the Judiciary.
			<lb />
			The relative importance of their roles varied from time to time.
			<lb />
			The AMENDMENT makes three important changes -(i) primacy
			<lb />
			of judiciary is whittled down; (ii) role of the executive is also
			<lb />
			curtailed; and (iii) representatives of civil society are made
			<lb />
			part of the mechanism.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			98. Primacy of the opinion of judiciary in the matter of
			<lb />
			judicial appointments is not the only means for the
			<lb />
			establishment of an independent and efficient judiciary. There
			<lb />
			is abundance of opinion (in discerning and responsible
			<lb />
			quarters of the civil society in the legal fraternity, jurists,
			<lb />
			political theorists and scholars) that primacy to the opinion of
			<lb />
			judiciary is not a normative or constitutional fundamental for
			<lb />
			establishment of an independent and efficient judiciary. Such
			<lb />
			an assumption has been proved to be of doubtful accuracy. It
			<lb />
			is Parliament&apos;s asserted assumption that induction of civil
			<lb />
			society representation will bring about critically desirable
			<lb />
			transparency, commitment and participation of the ultimate
			<lb />
			stakeholders -the people. The fountain of all constitutional
			<lb />
			authority, to ensure appointment of the most suitable persons
			<lb />
			with due regard to legitimate aspirations of the several
			<lb />
			competing interests. Various democratic societies have and
			<lb />
			are experimenting with models involving association of civil
			<lb />
			society representation in such selection process. Assessment
			<lb />
			of the product of such experiments are however inconclusive.
			<lb />
			The question is not whether the model conceived by the
			<lb />
			AMENDMENT would yield a more independent and efficient
			<lb />
			judiciary. The question is whether Parliament&apos;s wisdom and
			<lb />
			authority to undertake such an experiment by resort to
			<lb />
			constituent power is subject to curial audit.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			99. As rightly pointed out by the Attorney General, the basic
			<lb />
			feature of the Constitution is not primacy of the opinion of the
			<lb />
			CJI (Collegium) but lies in non investiture of absolute power in
			<lb />
			the President (Executive) to choose and appoint judges of
			<lb />
			CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS. That feature is not abrogated by the
			<lb />
			AMENDMENT. The Executive may at best only make a proposal
			<lb />
			through its representative in the NJAC, i.e. the Law Minister.
			<lb />
			Such proposal, if considered unworthy, can still be rejected by
			<lb />
			the other members of the NJAC. The worth of a candidate
			<lb />
			does not depend upon who proposes the name nor the
			<lb />
			candidate&apos;s political association, if any, should be a
			<lb />
			disqualification.
			<lb />
			&quot;………, even party men can be fiercely independent after being
			<lb />
			appointed judges, as has been proved by some judges who were
			<lb />
			active in politics. Justice K.S.
		</p>
		<item>
			Hegde served as a member of Rajya
			<lb />
			Sabha from 1952 to 1957 and was elevated as a High Court judge
			<lb />
			directly from Rajya Sabha. Though he was a congress MP, he
			<lb />
			proved to be so independent that he was superseded in 1973 in the
			<lb />
			appointment of the CJI by his own party&apos;s government. Justice
			<lb />
			Tekchand was also a member of Rajya Sabha before becoming a
			<lb />
			judge. He was appointed when he was a sitting MP, but he proved
			<lb />
			to be a fine judge whose report on prohibition is a landmark.
			<lb />
			Another prominent example is Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer who was
			<lb />
			made a judge of the Kerala High Court in 1968, though he had not
			<lb />
			only been an MLA but also a minister in the Namboodiripad
			<lb />
			government (1957-59) in Kerala. In 1973, Justice S.M. Sikri, the
			<lb />
			CJI, was totally opposed to the elevation of Justice Iyer to the apex
			<lb />
			court on the ground that he had been a politician who held the
			<lb />
			office of a cabinet minister in Kerala. It was A.N. Ray who cleared
			<lb />
			his elevation, and Justice Iyer proved to be a luminous example of
			<lb />
			what a judge ought to be. He was one of the finest judges who ever
			<lb />
			sat on the bench of the Supreme Court who tried to bridge the gap
			<lb />
			between the Supreme Court and the common people. There is also
			<lb />
			the example of Justice Bahrul Islam who served as a member of
			<lb />
			Rajya Sabha for 10 years before being appointed a High Court
			<lb />
			judge. He was subsequently elevated to the Supreme Court. He
			<lb />
			absolved Jagannath Mishra, the Chief Minister of Bihar, in the
			<lb />
			urban cooperative bank scandal, and immediately thereafter
			<lb />
			resigned to contest the Lok Sabha election as a Congress(I)
			<lb />
			candidate from Barpeta -he never enjoyed a clean reputation. So,
			<lb />
			it is not proper to make any generalization. People of impeccable
			<lb />
			rectitude have to be handpicked.&quot; 187
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			100. Critical analysis of Articles 124, 217 and 124-A and
			<lb />
			124-B leads to the position that the Executive Branch of
			<lb />
			Government cannot push through an &apos;undeserving candidate&apos;
			<lb />
			so long as at least two members representing the Judicial
			<lb />
			Branch are united in their view as to unsuitability of that
			<lb />
			candidate. Even one eminent person and a single judicial
			<lb />
			member of NJAC could effectively stall entry of an unworthy
			<lb />
			appointment. Similarly, the judicial members also cannot
			<lb />
			push through persons of their choice unless at least one other
			<lb />
			member belonging to the non-judicial block supports the
			<lb />
			candidate proposed by them.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			101. A democratic form of government is perhaps the best
			<lb />
			institution invented for preservation of liberties. At least that
			<lb />
			is the belief of societies which adopt this model of governance.
			<lb />
			True, there are many variants of democracy. Analysis of the
			<lb />
			variants is outside the scope of this judgment. Under any
			<lb />
			constitutional model, primary responsibility to preserve
			<lb />
			liberties of the people is entrusted to the legislative and
			<lb />
			executive branches. Such entrustment is predicated on the
			<lb />
			structural and empirical assumption that legislators chosen
			<lb />
			periodically would strive to protect the liberties of their &quot;only
			<lb />
			masters -the people&quot;. This is for two reasons operating in
			<lb />
			tandem.
			<lb />
			They are the obligation to discharge the trust
			<lb />
			reposed and the fear of losing the glory of being the chosen
			<lb />
			representative. An in built possibility in the system of periodic
			<lb />
			elections.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			102. To assume or assert that judiciary alone is concerned
			<lb />
			with the preservation of liberties and does that job well, is an
			<lb />
			assumption that is dogmatic, bereft of evidentiary basis and
			<lb />
			historically disproved. Eminent constitution jurist and teacher
			<lb />
			Laurence H. Tribe has the following to say in the context of the
			<lb />
			American experience.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;No one should assume that the Supreme Court need always
			<lb />
			strike down laws and executive actions in order to protect our
			<lb />
			liberties. On the contrary, sometimes the Court best guarantees
			<lb />
			our rights by deferring to, rather than overruling, the political
			<lb />
			branches. When the Supreme Court, from 1900 to 1937, struck
			<lb />
			down dozens of child labor laws, minimum wage laws, working
			<lb />
			condition regulations, and laws protecting workers; rights to
			<lb />
			organize unions, on the ground that such rules infringed on
			<lb />
			property rights and violated &quot;liberty of contract,&quot; the only rights
			<lb />
			the Court really vindicated were the rights to be overworked,
			<lb />
			underpaid, or unemployed. The Court eventually reversed itself
			<lb />
			on these issues when it recognized that, in twentieth-century
			<lb />
			America, such laws are not intrusions upon human freedom in
			<lb />
			any meaningful sense, but are instead entirely reasonable and just
			<lb />
			ways of combating economic subjugation.
			<lb />
			In upholding a
			<lb />
			minimum wage law in the watershed case of West Coast Hotel v.
			<lb />
			Parrish, the Supreme Court concluded in 1937 that, in the light
			<lb />
			of &quot;recent economic experience&quot;, such statutes were justified
			<lb />
			because they prevent &quot;the exploitation of a class of workers in
			<lb />
			ways detrimental to their health and well being.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Naturally, in this imperfect world, the Supreme Court has
			<lb />
			not always guarded our liberties as jealously as it should.
			<lb />
			During the First World War and again in the McCarthy era, the
			<lb />
			Court often shrank from the affirmation of our rights to think and
			<lb />
			speak as we believe. And in the war hysteria following bombing
			<lb />
			of Pearl Harbor, the Supreme Court in Korematsu v. United
			<lb />
			States upheld the imprisonment of thousands of Americans of
			<lb />
			Japanese ancestry who had committed no crime. In light of such
			<lb />
			lapses, some have argued that when it comes to protecting
			<lb />
			fundamental rights, the Supreme Court is essentially redundant:
			<lb />
			on most occasions the Congress and the President will adequately
			<lb />
			safeguard our rights, and in those difficult times when the
			<lb />
			political branches cannot be counted on, neither can the Court.&quot; 188
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			103. Our experience is not dissimilar. Judgments in A.K.
			<lb />
			Gopalan 189 , Sankalchand 190 and ADM Jabalpur 191 (to mention a
			<lb />
			few) should lead to an identical inference that in difficult times
			<lb />
			when political branches cannot be counted upon, neither can
			<lb />
			the Judiciary.
			<lb />
			The point sought to be highlighted is that
			<lb />
			judiciary is not the ONLY constitutional organ which protects
			<lb />
			liberties of the people. Accordingly, primacy to the opinion of
			<lb />
			the judiciary in the matter of judicial appointments is not the
			<lb />
			only mode of securing independence of judiciary for protection
			<lb />
			of liberties. Consequently, the assumption that primacy of the
			<lb />
			Judicial Branch in the appointments process is an essential
			<lb />
			element and thus a basic feature is empirically flawed without
			<lb />
			any basis either in the constitutional history of the Nation or
			<lb />
			any other and normatively fallacious apart from being contrary
			<lb />
			to political theory.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			104. I now deal with the submission that presence of the law
			<lb />
			minister in the NJAC undermines independence of judiciary.
			<lb />
			According to the petitioners, the presence of a member of the
			<lb />
			Executive invariably has the effect of shifting the power
			<lb />
			dynamics. The presence of the Law Minister in the NJAC
			<lb />
			which confers 1/6 of the voting power per se undermines the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary. The submission is untenable.
			<lb />
			The Executive with a vast administrative machinery under its
			<lb />
			control is capable of making enormous and valuable
			<lb />
			contribution to the selection process. The objection is justified
			<lb />
			to some extent on the trust deficit in the Executive Branch in

			the constitutional sense 192 , to be a component of the NJAC.
			<lb />
			The same logic applies a fortiari to the Judicial branch,
			<lb />
			notwithstanding the belief that it is the least dangerous
			<lb />
			branch. The Constituent Assembly emphatically declined to
			<lb />
			repose exclusive trust even in the CJI. To wholly eliminate
			<lb />
			the Executive from the process of selection would be
			<lb />
			inconsistent with the foundational premise that government in
			<lb />
			a democracy is by chosen representatives of the people. Under
			<lb />
			the scheme of our Constitution, the Executive is chartered

			clear authority to administer critical areas such as defence of
			<lb />
			the realm, internal security, maintenance of public order,
			<lb />
			taxation, management of fiscal policies and a host of other
			<lb />
			192 Laurence H. Tribe (American Constitutional Law) Second Edition, Page 2 of Chapter 1 &quot;Approaches to
			<lb />
			Constitutional Analysis&quot; -&quot;That all lawful power derives from the people and must be held in check to
			<lb />
			preserve their freedom is the oldest and most central tenet of American constitutionalism. At the
			<lb />
			outset, only a small number of explicit substantive limitations on the exercise of governmental authority
			<lb />
			were thought essential; in the main, it was believed that personal freedom could be secured more effectively
			<lb />
			by decentralization than by express command. From the thought of seventeenth century English liberals,
			<lb />
			particularly, as elaborated in eighteenth century France by Montesquieu, the Constitution&apos;s framers had
			<lb />
			derived the conviction that human rights could best be preserved by inaction and indirection-shielded
			<lb />
			behind the lay of deliberately fragmented centers of countervailing power, in a vision almost
			<lb />
			Newtonian in its inspiration. In this first model, the centralized accumulation of power in any man or
			<lb />
			single group of men meant tyranny; the division and separation of powers, both vertically (along the
			<lb />
			axis of federal, state and local authority) and horizontally (along the axis of legislative, executive and
			<lb />
			judicial authority) meant liberty. It was thus essential that no department, branch, or level of
			<lb />
			government be empowered to achieve dominance on its own. If the legislature would punish, it must
			<lb />
			enlist the cooperation of the other branches-the executive to prosecute, the judicial to try and convict. So
			<lb />
			too with each other center of governmental power; exercising the mix of functions delegated to it by the
			<lb />
			people in the social compact that was the Constitution, each power center would remain dependent
			<lb />
			upon the others for the final efficacy of the social designs.&quot;

			aspects, touching every aspect of the administration of the
			<lb />
			Nation and lives of its people. In this context, to hold that it
			<lb />
			should be totally excluded from the process of appointing
			<lb />
			judges would be wholly illogical and inconsistent with the
			<lb />
			foundations of the theory of democracy and a doctrinal heresy.
			<lb />
			Such exclusion has no parallel in any other democracy whose
			<lb />
			models were examined by the Constituent Assembly and none
			<lb />
			other were brought to our notice either. Established principles
			<lb />
			of constitutional government, practices in other democratic
			<lb />
			constitutional arrangements and the fact that the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly provided a role for the Executive clearly prohibit the
			<lb />
			inference that Executive participation in the selection process
			<lb />
			abrogates a basic feature. The Attorney General is right in his
			<lb />
			submission that exclusion of the Executive Branch is
			<lb />
			destructive of the basic feature of checks and balances -a
			<lb />
			fundamental principle in constitutional theory.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			105. That takes me to the second provision which is under
			<lb />
			challenge. Article 124A.(1)(d) which stipulates that the NJAC
			<lb />
			should consist of two eminent persons 193 . Considerable debate
			<lb />
			193 Article 124A. National Judicial Appointments Commission.-(1) There shall be a Commission to be
			<lb />
			known as the National Judicial Appointments Commission consisting of the following, namely-
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			(d)
			<lb />
			two eminent persons to be nominated by the committee consisting of the Prime Minister,
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India and the Leader of Opposition in the House of the People or where there is no such
			<lb />
			Leader of Opposition, then, the Leader of single largest Opposition Party in the House of the
			<lb />
			People-Members.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Page 556
			<lb />
			took place during the course of hearing regarding validity of
			<lb />
			this provision, the gist of which is captured in the judgment of
			<lb />
			Khehar, J. The attack is again on the ground that the
			<lb />
			provision is utterly without guidance regarding the choice of
			<lb />
			eminent persons. Petitioners argued that (i) there could be
			<lb />
			bipartisan compromise between the party in power and the
			<lb />
			opposition, resulting in sharing the two slots earmarked for
			<lb />
			eminent persons. Such possibility would eventually enable
			<lb />
			political parties to make appointments purely on political
			<lb />
			considerations, thereby destroying independence of judiciary;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii) even assuming that the two eminent persons nominated are
			<lb />
			absolute political neutrals, but are strangers to the judicial
			<lb />
			system, they would not be able to make any meaningful
			<lb />
			contribution to the selection process, as they would have no
			<lb />
			resources to collect appropriate data relevant for the decision
			<lb />
			making process; (iii) the possibility of two eminent persons
			<lb />
			vetoing the candidature of a person approved unanimously by
			<lb />
			the three judicial members of the NJAC itself is destructive of
			<lb />
			the basic structure.
			<lb />
			Provided that one of the eminent person shall be nominated from amongst the persons belonging to
			<lb />
			the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, Minorities or Women.
			<lb />
			Provided further that an eminent person shall be nominated for a period of three years and shall not
			<lb />
			be eligible for renomination.

			106. Transparency is a vital factor in constitutional
			<lb />
			governance. This Court in innumerable cases noted that
			<lb />
			constitutionalism demands rationality in every sphere of State
			<lb />
			action. In the context of judicial proceedings, this Court held
			<lb />
			in Naresh Shridhar Mirajkar &amp; Ors. v. State of Maharashtra &amp;
			<lb />
			Anr. 194 :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;20. ……………….Public trial in open court is undoubtedly essential
			<lb />
			for the healthy, objective and fair administration of justice. Trial held
			<lb />
			subject to the public scrutiny and gaze naturally acts as a check against
			<lb />
			judicial caprice or vagaries, and serves as a powerful instrument for
			<lb />
			creating confidence of the public in the fairness, objectivity, and
			<lb />
			impartiality of the administration of justice. Public confidence in the
			<lb />
			administration of justice is of such great significance that there can be
			<lb />
			no two opinions on the broad proposition that in discharging their
			<lb />
			functions as judicial tribunals, courts must generally hear causes in
			<lb />
			open and must permit the public admission to the court-room. As
			<lb />
			Bentham has observed:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;In the darkness of secrecy sinister interest, and evil in
			<lb />
			every shape, have full swing. Only in proportion as publicity
			<lb />
			has place can any of the checks applicable to judicial injustice
			<lb />
			operate. Where there is no publicity there is no justice.
			<lb />
			Publicity is the very soul of justice. It is the keenest spur to
			<lb />
			exertion, and surest of all guards against improbity. It keeps the
			<lb />
			Judge himself while trying under trial (in the sense that) the
			<lb />
			security of securities is publicity.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Transparency is an aspect of rationality.
			<lb />
			The need for
			<lb />
			transparency is more in the case of appointment process.
			<lb />
			Proceedings of the collegium were absolutely opaque and
			<lb />
			inaccessible both to public and history, barring occasional
			<lb />
			leaks. Ruma Pal , J. is on record -
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Consensus within the collegium is sometimes resolved through a
			<lb />
			trade-off resulting in dubious appointments with disastrous
			<lb />
			consequences for the litigants and the credibility of the judicial
			<lb />
			system.
			<lb />
			Besides, institutional independence has also been
			<lb />
			compromised by growing sycophancy and &apos;lobbying&apos; within the
			<lb />
			system.&quot; 195
			<lb />
			One beneficial purpose the induction of representatives of civil
			<lb />
			society would hopefully serve is that it acts as a check on
			<lb />
			unwholesome trade-offs within the collegium and incestuous
			<lb />
			accommodations between Judicial and Executive branches.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			To believe that members of the judiciary alone could bring
			<lb />
			valuable inputs to the appointment process requires great
			<lb />
			conceit and disrespect for the civil society. Iyer, J. cautioned -
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;74. ………… And when criteria for transfers of Judges are put
			<lb />
			forward by the President which may upset past practices we must,
			<lb />
			as democrats, remember Learned Hand who once said that the
			<lb />
			spirit of liberty is &quot;the spirit which is not too sure that it is right&quot;.
			<lb />
			That great Judge was fond of recalling Cromwell&apos;s statement : &quot;I
			<lb />
			beseech ye in the bowels of Christ, think that ye may be mistaken.&quot;
			<lb />
			He told a Senate Committee. &quot;I should like to have that written
			<lb />
			over the portals of every church, every school and every
			<lb />
			court-house, any may I say, of every legislative body in the
			<lb />
			United States. I should like to have every court begin &quot;I
			<lb />
			beseech ye in the bowels of Christ, think that we may be
			<lb />
			mistaken.&quot;

			<lb />
			Replace &quot;transfers&quot; and &quot;President&quot; with &quot;appointments&quot; and
			<lb />
			&quot;Parliament&quot; and Iyer, J&apos;s admonition is custom made to answer
			<lb />
			the objections (ii) and (iii) of the petitioners.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			107. There is a possibility that the apprehension expressed by
			<lb />
			the petitioners might come true. The possibility of abuse of a
			<lb />
			power conferred by the Constitution is no ground for denying
			<lb />
			the authority to confer such power.
			<lb />
			Bachawat, J. in I.C.
			<lb />
			Golak Nath (supra) opined as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;235. It is said that the Parliament is abusing its power of
			<lb />
			amendment by making too many frequent changes. If the
			<lb />
			Parliament has the power to make the amendments, the choice of
			<lb />
			making any particular amendment must be left to it. Questions of
			<lb />
			policy cannot be debated in this Court. The possibility of abuse of a
			<lb />
			power is not the test of its existence. In Webb v. Outrim [1907]
			<lb />
			A.C. 81, Lord Hobhouse said, &quot;If they find that on the due
			<lb />
			construction of the Act a legislative power falls within S. 92, it
			<lb />
			would be quite wrong of them to deny its existence because by
			<lb />
			some possibility it may of be abused, or limit the range which
			<lb />
			otherwise would be open to the Dominion Parliament&quot;. With
			<lb />
			reference to the doctrine of implied prohibition against the exercise
			<lb />
			of power ascertained in accordance with ordinary rules of
			<lb />
			construction, Knox C.J., in the Amalgamated Society of Engineers
			<lb />
			v. The Adelaide Steamship Company Limited 129 C.L.R. 151, said,
			<lb />
			&quot;It means the necessity of protection against the aggression of some
			<lb />
			outside and possibly hostile body. It is based on distrust, lest
			<lb />
			powers, if once conceded to the least degree, might be abused to
			<lb />
			the point of destruction. But possible abuse of power is no reason
			<lb />
			in British law for limiting the natural force of the language creating
			<lb />
			them&quot;.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			However, it was a dissenting opinion. But this Court in I.R.
			<lb />
			Coelho (supra), Sabharwal, J. speaking for a unanimous Bench
			<lb />
			of nine Judges, held as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;76.
			<lb />
			It is also contended that the power to pack up laws in the
			<lb />
			Ninth Schedule in absence of any indicia in Article 31B has been
			<lb />
			abused and that abuse is likely to continue. It is submitted that the
			<lb />
			Ninth Schedule which commenced with only 13 enactments has
			<lb />
			now a list of 284 enactments. The validity of Article 31B is not in
			<lb />
			question before us. Further, mere possibility of abuse is not a
			<lb />
			relevant test to determine the validity of a provision. The
			<lb />
			people, through the Constitution, have vested the power to make
			<lb />
			laws in their representatives through Parliament in the same
			<lb />
			manner in which they have entrusted the responsibility to adjudge,
			<lb />
			interpret and construe law and the Constitution including its
			<lb />
			limitation in the judiciary. We, therefore, cannot make any
			<lb />
			assumption about the alleged abuse of the power.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			[emphasis supplied]
			<lb />
			In the final analysis, all power could be misused including
			<lb />
			judicial power. The remedy is not to deny grant of power but
			<lb />
			to structure it so as to eliminate the potential for abuse. The
			<lb />
			power to nominate two eminent persons is conferred upon
			<lb />
			three high constitutional functionaries -the Prime Minister,
			<lb />
			the Leader of the Opposition and the CJI. It is elementary
			<lb />
			political knowledge that the Prime Minister and the Leader of
			<lb />
			Opposition would always have conflicting political interests
			<lb />
			and would rarely agree upon any issue.
			<lb />
			Nonetheless,
			<lb />
			possibility of a bipartisan compromise cannot be ruled out.
			<lb />
			Though, the presence of CJI in the Committee should normally
			<lb />
			be a strong deterrent, the possibility of the CJI failing to
			<lb />
			perceive a political compromise or helplessness in the event of
			<lb />
			such compromise, cannot be ruled out.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			108. It is incontestable that nomination of eminent persons is
			<lb />
			not immune to judicial review. There is thus possibility of
			<lb />
			delay in functioning of NJAC and inevitably the process of
			<lb />
			appointments to CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS. It is, therefore,
			<lb />
			essential that there must be an entrenched process of
			<lb />
			nomination of eminent persons which eliminates risk of
			<lb />
			possible bipartisan compromises.
			<lb />
			The only conceivable
			<lb />
			curative is to incorporate another tier of scrutiny in the
			<lb />
			process of nomination. In my considered view, the following
			<lb />
			safeguard would bring this process within permissible
			<lb />
			contours of the basic feature simultaneously eliminating the
			<lb />
			&apos;delay factor&apos;. The Committee contemplated under Article
			<lb />
			124-A(1)(a) should prepare a panel of three members for each
			<lb />
			of the two categories of the nominees (for eminent persons) -in
			<lb />
			all a panel of six persons. Such panel should be placed before
			<lb />
			the full house of the Supreme Court for voting. Nominees
			<lb />
			securing the highest vote in each of the two categories should
			<lb />
			eventually be nominated as eminent members of the NJAC.
			<lb />
			Such procedure would still preserve the choice of eminent
			<lb />
			persons primarily with the Committee contemplated under
			<lb />
			Article 124-A, while incorporating sufficient safeguard against
			<lb />
			possible abuse of the power by the Committee.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			109. The third provision whose validity is under attack is
			<lb />
			Article 124 B(c), which obligates NJAC to ensure that the person
			<lb />
			recommended is of ability and integrity. The challenge is on the ground
			<lb />
			that the AMENDMENT does not lay down any guidelines to be
			<lb />
			followed by the NJAC for assessing ability and integrity. Even
			<lb />
			in the absence of any express declaration, such an obligation
			<lb />
			is inherent and implied, having regard to functional
			<lb />
			responsibilities entrusted to the NJAC. The precision is only
			<lb />
			an abundanti cautela. Perhaps prompted by certain bad
			<lb />
			experiences of the past, both pre and post Second Judges case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			110. Having regard to the nature (i) of the document by which
			<lb />
			such obligation is created; (ii) the composition of the body
			<lb />
			(NJAC) upon which the obligation is cast; and (iii) the nature of
			<lb />
			the assignment, the argument is required to be rejected. NJAC
			<lb />
			is a constitutional authority created to perform an important
			<lb />
			constitutional function. Its charter is the Constitution itself.
			<lb />
			Notwithstanding, the prolixity of our Constitution, a
			<lb />
			constitution is not expected or required to spell out every
			<lb />
			minute detail regarding administration of the State. In the
			<lb />
			context of the American Constitution, it is said that the
			<lb />
			Constitution is an intentionally incomplete, often deliberately indeterminate structure for
			<lb />
			the participatory evolution of political ideals and governmental practices.
			<lb />
			Constitutions
			<lb />
			enumerate
			<lb />
			structural
			<lb />
			arrangements
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			Government and specify the outer limits of powers of each
			<lb />
			organ of the State. Within such limits, how the various organs
			<lb />
			of the State ought to discharge their allocated functions is a
			<lb />
			matter of detail, either to be provided by law or convention. All
			<lb />
			written democratic Constitutions are full of abstract moral
			<lb />
			commands!
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			111. Three members of the highest judicial body of this
			<lb />
			country, a member of the Union Cabinet and two eminent
			<lb />
			persons chosen by a Committee consisting of three exalted
			<lb />
			office holders under the Constitution constitute the NJAC. To
			<lb />
			suggest that the NJAC requires detailed guidelines expressly
			<lb />
			spelt out in the text of the Constitution amounts to judicially
			<lb />
			mandating inflexible standards for constitutional drafting. The
			<lb />
			task of expounding a Constitution is crucially different from that of construing a statute.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			112. Provisions of the Constitution are not to be interpreted in
			<lb />
			a broad and liberal way. They are not to be construed in the
			<lb />
			manner in which a piece of subordinate legislation or, for that
			<lb />
			matter, even a statute is required to be interpreted. This Court
			<lb />
			in S.R. Bommai had an occasion to consider this question.
			<lb />
			Dealing with the authority of the President under Article 356 of
			<lb />
			the Constitution of India and whether the exercise of such
			<lb />
			authority by the President is amenable to judicial review on the
			<lb />
			parameters enunciated by this Court in Barium Chemicals Ltd.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			v. Company Law Board, AIR 1967 SC 295, rejected the
			<lb />
			submission.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;35. ………… The test laid down by this Court in Barium
			<lb />
			Chemicals Ltd. v. Company Law Board and subsequent decisions
			<lb />
			for adjudging the validity of administrative action can have no
			<lb />
			application for testing the satisfaction of the President under Article
			<lb />
			356. It must be remembered that the power conferred by Article
			<lb />
			356 is of an extraordinary nature to be exercised in grave
			<lb />
			emergencies and, therefore, the exercise of such power cannot be
			<lb />
			equated to the power exercised in administrative law field and
			<lb />
			cannot, therefore, be tested by the same yardstick. …….
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			255. …….. The exercise of the power under Article 356 is a
			<lb />
			constitutional exercise of the power. The normal subjective
			<lb />
			satisfaction of an administrative decision on objective basis applied
			<lb />
			by the courts to administrative decisions by subordinate officers or
			<lb />
			quasi-judicial or subordinate legislation does not apply to the
			<lb />
			decision of the President under Article 356.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			373. …….. So far as the approach adopted by this Court in
			<lb />
			Barium Chemicals 6 is concerned, it is a decision concerning
			<lb />
			subjective satisfaction of an authority created by a statute. The
			<lb />
			principles evolved then cannot ipso facto be extended to the
			<lb />
			exercise of a constitutional power under Article 356. Having regard
			<lb />
			to the fact that this is a high constitutional power exercised by the
			<lb />
			highest constitutional functionary of the Nation, it may not be
			<lb />
			appropriate to adopt the tests applicable in the case of action taken
			<lb />
			by statutory or administrative authorities -nor at any rate, in their
			<lb />
			entirety.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			113. Such a test is relevant only for bodies created by statutes
			<lb />
			and subordinate legislation.
			<lb />
			The functioning of any
			<lb />
			constitutional body is only disciplined by appropriate
			<lb />
			legislation. Constitution does not lay down any guidelines for
			<lb />
			the functioning of the President and Prime Minister nor the
			<lb />
			Governors or
			<lb />
			the Chief Ministers. Performance of
			<lb />
			constitutional duties entrusted to them is structured by
			<lb />
			legislation and constitutional culture. The provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution cannot be read like a last will and testament lest it becomes one.
			<lb />
			Even prior to the AMENDMENT, the constitutional text had no
			<lb />
			express guidelines for the President and the CJI to follow. It is
			<lb />
			however nobody&apos;s case that the pre-AMENDMENT selection
			<lb />
			scenario conferred any uncanalised discretion and therefore
			<lb />
			resulted in some undesirable judicial appointments. If in
			<lb />
			practice, occasionally personal preferences outweighed
			<lb />
			concerns of public interest resulting in undesirable
			<lb />
			appointments, it is not because of constitutional silences in
			<lb />
			this area but because of
			<lb />
			shortcomings in the ethical
			<lb />
			standards of the participants in the selection process. After the
			<lb />
			AMENDMENT, the obligation is unvaried. The only change is in
			<lb />
			the composition of the players to whom the task is entrusted
			<lb />
			and the mode of performing the task is altered with a view to
			<lb />
			achieve greater degree of transparency in the selection process.
			<lb />
			To contend that the AMENDMENT is destructive of the basic
			<lb />
			structure since it does not lay down any guidelines
			<lb />
			tantamounts to holding that the design of the Constitution as
			<lb />
			originally enacted is defective!
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			114. The next submission which is required to be dealt is that
			<lb />
			Section 6(6) of the ACT which stipulates that if any two
			<lb />
			members of the NJAC do not agree with the recommendation
			<lb />
			proposed by the NJAC, the NJAC shall not recommend such
			<lb />
			candidate. In the opinion of the petitioners, it is a provision
			<lb />
			which confers veto power on two members of the NJAC to
			<lb />
			scuttle proposals. It is submitted that though the provision is
			<lb />
			facially innocuous, in practice, this would result in giving the
			<lb />
			Executive a power of veto to reject the proposals made by the
			<lb />
			three judicial members of the NJAC. Such a provision is
			<lb />
			violative of the basic structure of the Constitution. It is further
			<lb />
			argued that though the provision is not part of the
			<lb />
			AMENDMENT, since the AMENDMENT and the ACT are made
			<lb />
			simultaneously and the ACT being complementary to the
			<lb />
			AMENDMENT, the ACT must be understood to be a part of the
			<lb />
			design of the AMENDMENT and, therefore, Section 6(6) is
			<lb />
			required to be struck down on the ground it is violative of the
			<lb />
			basic structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			115. The respondents submitted that Section 6(6) of the ACT
			<lb />
			only prescribes a special majority for sanctifying the
			<lb />
			recommendations of NJAC. Prescription of special majorities
			<lb />
			in law is a known phenomenon.
			<lb />
			The Constitution itself
			<lb />
			prescribes special majorities in certain cases. For example,
			<lb />
			Article 368(2) prescribes a special majority for amending the
			<lb />
			Constitution. Similarly, Article 124(4) prescribes a special
			<lb />
			majority for the impeachment of judges of the CONSTITUTIONAL
			<lb />
			COURTS. It is argued that the petitioners presumption that
			<lb />
			only Government could take advantage of the prescription
			<lb />
			under Section 6(6) is totally baseless. In a given case it may
			<lb />
			happen that two judicial members of the NJAC can turn down
			<lb />
			the proposal of the NJAC. Learned Attorney General also
			<lb />
			submitted that such a prescription of a special majority is also
			<lb />
			a part of the regime created under Second Judges case and,
			<lb />
			therefore, there is nothing constitutionally objectionable in
			<lb />
			such a prescription.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			116. The question whether the content of Section 6(6) confers
			<lb />
			a power of veto or prescribes a special majority is only of
			<lb />
			semantic relevance. Whatever name we call it, the result is
			<lb />
			the same. The two members of the NJAC can override the
			<lb />
			opinion of the other four and stall the recommendation. I do
			<lb />
			not find anything inherently illegal about such a prescription.
			<lb />
			For the purpose of the present case, I do not even want to
			<lb />
			embark upon an enquiry whether the constitutional fascination for the
			<lb />
			basic structure doctrine be made a Trojan horse to penetrate the entire legislative camp.
			<lb />
			For my part, I would like to examine the question in greater
			<lb />
			detail before answering the question. There are conflicting
			<lb />
			views of this Court on this proposition. 197 In my opinion, such
			<lb />
			an enquiry is not required in this case in view of the majority
			<lb />
			decision that the AMENDMENT is unsustainable. Some of the
			<lb />
			learned counsel for the petitioners placed reliance on S.R.
			<lb />
			Bommai case as a justification for the invocation of the
			<lb />
			doctrine of basic structure.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			117. Only to indicate but not determine conclusively the scope
			<lb />
			of the enquiry to answer the submission of the petitioners, I
			<lb />
			examine S.R. Bommai case. The question before this Court
			<lb />
			was whether the action of the President in invoking the powers
			<lb />
			under Article 356 was constitutionally tenable? In other
			<lb />
			words, whether the material on which the President acted was
			<lb />
			constitutionally relevant for the invocation of powers under
			<lb />
			Article 356. The submission of the petitioners before this
			<lb />
			Court was that the exercise of powers under Article 356 was
			<lb />
			inconsistent with two features of the Constitution, i.e. the
			<lb />
			197 Maharao Sahib Shri Bhim Singhji v. Union of India &amp; Ors., (1981) 1 SCC 166, Krishna Iyer, J. -
			<lb />
			&quot;20. The question of basic structure being breached cannot arise when we examine the vires of an
			<lb />
			ordinary legislation as distinguished from a constitutional amendment.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Page 569
			<lb />
			democracy and federalism, therefore, destructive of the basic
			<lb />
			structure, as the Presidential action under Article 356 resulted
			<lb />
			in the super session of the democratically elected State
			<lb />
			Governments by the Union Government.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			118. Repelling the contention, this Court held that secularism
			<lb />
			is also one of the basic features of the Constitution. The
			<lb />
			conscious inaction of the various State Governments and
			<lb />
			consequential failure to prevent certain activities which in the
			<lb />
			opinion of the petitioners (endorsed by this court by the
			<lb />
			judgment) would ultimately result in the destruction of the
			<lb />
			secular fabric of the Constitution has certainly a relevant
			<lb />
			consideration for the exercise of extraordinary powers vested in
			<lb />
			the President under Article 356.
			<lb />
			Because Article 356
			<lb />
			obligates the President to resort to the action contemplated
			<lb />
			thereunder only if the President is satisfied that a situation has arisen in
			<lb />
			which the Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. Failure of the State Government to prevent
			<lb />
			activities which are bound to destroy the communal harmony
			<lb />
			between people following different religions is certainly
			<lb />
			inconsistent with the constitutional obligation of the State to
			<lb />
			upheld the Constitution of which secularism is a basic feature.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			S.R. Bommai case is no authority for the proposition that the
			<lb />
			validity of a legislation is amenable to judicial review on the
			<lb />
			ground of the basic structure doctrine.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			119. The fiasco created in Dinakaran case (supra) and Shanti
			<lb />
			Bhushan case (supra) would justify the participation of the
			<lb />
			members of the civil society in the process to eliminate from
			<lb />
			the selection process the maladies involved in the process
			<lb />
			pointed out by Ruma Pal, J. The abovementioned two are not
			<lb />
			the only cases where the system failed. It is a matter of public
			<lb />
			record that in the last 20 years, after the advent of the
			<lb />
			collegium system, number of recommendations made by the
			<lb />
			collegia of High Courts came to be rejected by the collegium of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court. There are also cases where the collegium
			<lb />
			of this Court quickly retraced its steps having rejected the
			<lb />
			recommendations of a particular name made by the High
			<lb />
			Court collegium giving scope for a great deal of speculation as
			<lb />
			to the factors which must have weighed with the collegium to
			<lb />
			make such a quick volteface. Such decisions may be justified
			<lb />
			in some cases and may not in other cases. There is no
			<lb />
			accountability in this regard. The records are absolutely
			<lb />
			beyond the reach of any person including the judges of this
			<lb />
			Court who are not lucky enough to become the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India. Such a state of affairs does not either enhance the
			<lb />
			credibility of the institution or good for the people of this
			<lb />
			country.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			120. For all the abovementioned reasons, I would upheld the
			<lb />
			AMENDMENT. However, in view of the majority decision, I do
			<lb />
			not see any useful purpose in examining the constitutionality
			<lb />
			of the ACT.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			121. Only an independent and efficient judicial system can
			<lb />
			create confidence in the society which it serves. The ever
			<lb />
			increasing pendency of matters before various CONSTITUTIONAL
			<lb />
			COURTS of this country is clearly not a certificate of efficiency.
			<lb />
			The frequency with which the residuary jurisdiction of this
			<lb />
			Court under Article 136 is invoked seeking correction of errors
			<lb />
			committed by the High Courts, some of which are trivial and
			<lb />
			some profound coupled with bewildering number of conflicting
			<lb />
			decisions rendered by the various benches of this Court only
			<lb />
			indicate that a comprehensive reform of the system is overdue.
			<lb />
			Selection process of the Judges to the CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS
			<lb />
			is only one of the aspect of such reforms. An attempt in that
			<lb />
			direction, unfortunately, failed to secure the approval of this
			<lb />
			Court leaving this Court with the sole responsibility and
			<lb />
			exclusive accountability of the efficiency of the legal system. I
			<lb />
			only part with this case recollecting the words of Macaulay -
			<lb />
			&quot;reform that you may preserve&quot; 198 . Future alone can tell whether I am
			<lb />
			rightly reminded of those words or not.

			Madan B. Lokur, J.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			1.
			<lb />
			I have had the benefit of going through the draft
			<lb />
			order prepared by my learned brothers Justice Khehar, Justice
			<lb />
			Chelameswar and Justice Kurian Joseph. While endorsing the
			<lb />
			view expressed by my learned brothers Justice Khehar and
			<lb />
			Justice Chelameswar, I would like to add a few words on the
			<lb />
			procedural aspect of dealing with an application for recusal.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			2.
			<lb />
			Justice Khehar has mentioned in Paragraph 17 of
			<lb />
			the draft order as follows:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The decision to remain as a member of the reconstituted Bench
			<lb />
			was mine, and mine alone.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			3.
			<lb />
			In my respectful opinion, when an application is
			<lb />
			made for the recusal of a judge from hearing a case, the
			<lb />
			application is made to the concerned judge and not to the
			<lb />
			Bench as a whole. Therefore, my learned brother Justice
			<lb />
			Khehar is absolutely correct in stating that the decision is
			<lb />
			entirely his, and I respect his decision.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			In a detailed order pronounced in Court on its own
			<lb />
			motion v. State &amp; Others 199 reference was made to a decision
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court of the United States in Jewell Ridge
			<lb />
			Coal Corporation v. Local No. 6167, United Mine Workers
			<lb />
			of America 200 , wherein it was held that a complaint as to the
			<lb />
			qualification of a justice of the Supreme Court to take part in
			<lb />
			the decision of a cause cannot properly be addressed to the
			<lb />
			Court as a whole and it is the responsibility of each justice to
			<lb />
			determine for himself the propriety of withdrawing from a case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			This view was adverted to by Justice Rehnquist in
			<lb />
			Hanrahan v. Hampton 201 in the following words:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Plaintiffs-respondents and their counsel in these cases have
			<lb />
			moved that I be recused from the proceedings in this case for the
			<lb />
			reasons stated in their 14-page motion and their five appendices
			<lb />
			filed with the Clerk of this Court on April 3, 1980. The motion is
			<lb />
			opposed by the state-defendant petitioners in the action. Since
			<lb />
			generally the Court as an institution leaves such motions, even
			<lb />
			though they be addressed to it, to the decision of the individual
			<lb />
			Justices to whom they refer, see Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. Mine
			<lb />
			Workers, 325 U.S. 897 (1945) (denial of petition for rehearing)
			<lb />
			(Jackson, J., concurring), I shall treat the motion as addressed to
			<lb />
			me individually. I have considered the motion, the Appendices,
			<lb />
			the response of the state defendants, 28 U.S.C. 455 (1976 ed.
			<lb />
			And Supp. II), and the current American Bar Association Code of
			<lb />
			Judicial Conduct, and the motion is accordingly denied.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			The issue of recusal may be looked at slightly
			<lb />
			differently apart from the legal nuance. What would happen if,
			<lb />
			in a Bench of five judges, an application is moved for the
			<lb />
			recusal of Judge A and after hearing the application Judge A
			<lb />
			decides to recuse from the case but the other four judges
			<lb />
			disagree and express the opinion that there is no justifiable
			<lb />
			reason for Judge A to recuse from the hearing? Can Judge A
			<lb />
			be compelled to hear the case even though he/she is desirous
			<lb />
			of recusing from the hearing? It is to get over such a difficult
			<lb />
			situation that the application for recusal is actually to an
			<lb />
			individual judge and not the Bench as a whole.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			As far as the view expressed by Justice Kurian
			<lb />
			Joseph that reasons should be given while deciding an
			<lb />
			application for recusal, I would prefer not to join that decision.
			<lb />
			In the first place, giving or not giving reasons was not an issue
			<lb />
			before us. That reasons are presently being given is a different
			<lb />
			matter altogether. Secondly, the giving of reasons is fraught
			<lb />
			with some difficulties. For example, it is possible that in a
			<lb />
			given case, a learned judge of the High Court accepts an
			<lb />
			application for his/her recusal from a case and one of the
			<lb />
			parties challenges that order in this Court. Upon hearing the
			<lb />
			parties, this Court comes to the conclusion that the reasons
			<lb />
			given by the learned judge were frivolous and therefore the
			<lb />
			order is incorrect and is then set aside. In such an event, can
			<lb />
			this Court pass a consequential order requiring the learned
			<lb />
			judge to hear the case even though he/she genuinely believes
			<lb />
			that he/she should not hear the case?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			The issue of recusal from hearing a case is not as
			<lb />
			simple as it appears. The questions thrown up are quite
			<lb />
			significant and since it appears that such applications are
			<lb />
			gaining frequency, it is time that some procedural and
			<lb />
			substantive rules are framed in this regard. If appropriate
			<lb />
			rules are framed, then, in a given case, it would avoid
			<lb />
			embarrassment to other judges on the Bench.

			1.
			<lb />
			The questions for consideration are: Firstly, whether the Constitution
			<lb />
			(Ninety-ninth Amendment) Act, 2014 which substitutes and replaces the
			<lb />
			extant procedure for the appointment of judges of the Supreme Court and the
			<lb />
			High Courts with a radically different procedure impinges on the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary and violates the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution; Secondly, whether the National Judicial Appointments
			<lb />
			Commission Act, 2014 is a constitutionally valid legislation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			2.
			<lb />
			In my opinion, the Constitution (Ninety-ninth Amendment) Act, 2014
			<lb />
			(for short the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act) alters the basic structure of
			<lb />
			the Constitution by introducing substantive changes in the appointment of
			<lb />
			judges to the Supreme Court and the High Courts and rewriting Article
			<lb />
			124(2) and Article 217(1) of the Constitution, thereby seriously
			<lb />
			compromising the independence of the judiciary. Consequently, the 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act is unconstitutional. Since the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act is unconstitutional, the National Judicial Appointments
			<lb />
			Commission Act, 2014 (for short the NJAC Act) which is the child of the
			<lb />
			99 th Constitution Amendment Act cannot independently survive on the
			<lb />
			statute books. Even otherwise, it violates Article 14 of the Constitution by
			<lb />
			enabling substantive arbitrariness in the appointment of judges to the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court and the High Courts.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3.
			<lb />
			Having had the benefit of reading the draft judgment of Justice
			<lb />
			Khehar, Justice Kurian Joseph and Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, I am in
			<lb />
			respectful agreement with the conclusions arrived at with regard to the
			<lb />
			constitutional validity of the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act but prefer to
			<lb />
			supplement them with additional reasons. I am in respectful disagreement
			<lb />
			with the view of Justice Chelameswar. I believe all the submissions made by
			<lb />
			various learned counsel led by Mr. Fali S. Nariman on behalf of the
			<lb />
			petitioners and by Mr. Mukul Rohatgi the learned Attorney-General on
			<lb />
			behalf of the respondents have been noted and dealt with by Justice Khehar
			<lb />
			in his draft judgment and in respect of some of them, I have nothing to add to
			<lb />
			what has already been said.

			Historical background
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			George Santayana, philosopher, essayist, poet and novelist is believed
			<lb />
			to have said something to the effect that: &apos;Those who do not remember their
			<lb />
			past are condemned to repeat their mistakes.&apos; Keeping this in mind, it is
			<lb />
			essential to appreciate the evolution of the process for the appointment of
			<lb />
			judges in the Indian judiciary, the various alternatives discussed and debated
			<lb />
			and then to consider and analyze the solution given by the Constitution
			<lb />
			(Ninety-ninth Amendment) Act, 2014 and the National Judicial
			<lb />
			Appointments Commission Act, 2014. This is important for another reason -
			<lb />
			some of the &apos;mistakes&apos; made before Constituent Assembly accepted the
			<lb />
			Constitution of India, have been revived and enacted, even though the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly debated and rejected them.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			Section 101 of the Government of India Act, 1919
			<lb />
			provided for the appointment of the Chief Justice and judges of the High
			<lb />
			Court and Section 102 provided for their tenure. It was provided that the
			<lb />
			appointment shall be made by His Majesty and the judge shall hold office
			<lb />
			&apos;during His Majesty&apos;s pleasure.&apos; Since the appointment process and the
			<lb />
			tenure of a judge depended upon the Crown&apos;s pleasure, perhaps the issue of
			<lb />
			the independence of the judiciary was not the subject of discussion in India.
			<lb />
			In any event, nothing was pointed out in this regard one way or the other
			<lb />
			during the submissions made by learned counsel.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			The Government of India Act, 1935 partially changed the
			<lb />
			procedure for the appointment of judges to the High Courts and introduced a
			<lb />
			procedure for the appointment of judges to the Federal Court constituted by
			<lb />
			the said Act. Section 200 and 201 dealt with the appointment of judges of
			<lb />
			the Federal Court and while the Crown continued to make the appointments
			<lb />
			(apparently without any formal consultation process), their tenure was fixed
			<lb />
			at the age of 65 years. Removal of a judge was possible only on the ground
			<lb />
			of misbehavior or of infirmity of mind or body. Section 201 provided for the
			<lb />
			salary, allowances, leave and pension of a judge and this could not be varied
			<lb />
			to his/her disadvantage after appointment. Section 220 and 221 related to the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge of the High Court and the provisions thereof were
			<lb />
			more or less similar to the appointment of a judge of the Federal Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			The Government of India Act, 1935 gave a semblance of an
			<lb />
			independent judiciary in that it provided some basic requirements of
			<lb />
			independence such as eligibility for appointment, security of tenure
			<lb />
			including the removal process, assurance of salary, allowances and pension
			<lb />
			etc. Again, nothing specific was shown to us, one way or the other, which
			<lb />
			could throw light on the contemporaneous practice regarding the
			<lb />
			appointment process or the independence of the judiciary. A general practice
			<lb />
			on the appointment of judges was, however, subsisting and this has been
			<lb />
			adverted to by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Al-Jehad Trust v.
			<lb />
			Federation of Pakistan. 202 It was observed that ever since 1911 when the
			<lb />
			Indian High Courts Act was enacted and certainly from 1915/1919 onwards
			<lb />
			when the Government of India Act was enacted, the recommendation of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice for the appointment of a judge was accepted even though the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge was a matter of the pleasure of the Crown. It was
			<lb />
			said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Act of appointment of a Chief Justice or a Judge in the superior Court is
			<lb />
			an executive act. No doubt this power is vested in the Executive under the
			<lb />
			relevant Articles of the Constitution, but the question is, as to how this
			<lb />
			power is to be exercised. Conventions can be pressed into service while
			<lb />
			construing a provision of the Constitution and for channelising and
			<lb />
			regulating the exercise of power under the Constitution: whereas under the
			<lb />
			Islamic Jurisprudence, a convention which is termed as Urf has a binding
			<lb />
			force on the basis of various Islamic sources, it has been a consistent
			<lb />
			practice which has acquired the status of convention during pre-partition
			<lb />
			days of India as well as post-partition period that the recommendations of
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of a High Court and the Chief Justice of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in India as well as in Pakistan have been consistently accepted and
			<lb />
			acted upon except in very rare cases. The practice of consultation of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of a High Court and the Indian Federal Court was obtaining
			<lb />
			even under the Indian High Courts Act [1911] as well as under the
			<lb />
			Government of India Act 1915, though the appointment of Judges of
			<lb />
			superior Courts in India was a matter of pleasure vested in the Crown. The
			<lb />
			recommendations of the Chief Justices even in those days were accepted as
			<lb />
			a matter of course.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Sapru Committee
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			The issue of the appointment of judges (for Independent India) first
			<lb />
			came up for discussion (as it appears) before the Sapru Committee. A Report
			<lb />
			prepared by this Committee in 1945 dealt with the Legislature, the Executive
			<lb />
			and the Judiciary in Chapter V thereof. The relevant paragraphs pertaining to
			<lb />
			the appointment of judges are paragraphs 259, 261 and 268. 203 The
			<lb />
			Committee was of the opinion that the independence of the judiciary is of
			<lb />
			&apos;supreme importance for the satisfactory working of the Constitution and
			<lb />
			nothing can be more detrimental to the well-being of a Province or
			<lb />
			calculated to undermine public confidence than the possibility of executive
			<lb />
			interference with the strength and independence of the highest tribunal of the
			<lb />
			Province.&apos; It was clear that it desired to secure the &apos;absolute independence&apos; of
			<lb />
			the High Court and to put the judges above party politics or influences. The
			<lb />
			Committee proposed a limited consultative system of appointment of judges
			<lb />
			completely leaving out the Legislature and the Executive. The Committee
			<lb />
			proposed consultation only between the Head of the State and the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India for appointments to the Supreme Court and for the High
			<lb />
			Courts, in addition, the Head of the Unit (Province) and the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			the High Court. The relevant paragraphs of the Report read as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;259. In our Recommendation No.13 we first recommend that there shall
			<lb />
			be a Supreme Court for the Union and a High Court in each of the units.
			<lb />
			Then in the second clause we recommend that the strength of judges in
			<lb />
			each of these Courts at the inception of the Union as well as the salaries to
			<lb />
			be paid to them shall be fixed in the Constitution Act and no modification
			<lb />
			in either shall be made except on the recommendation of the High Court,
			<lb />
			the Government concerned and the Supreme Court and with the sanction
			<lb />
			of the Head of the State, provided, however, that the salary of no judge
			<lb />
			shall be varied to his disadvantage during his term of office. In sub-clause
			<lb />
			(3) we recommend:-
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;(a) The Chief Justice of India shall be appointed by the Head of
			<lb />
			the State and the other judges of the Supreme Court shall be
			<lb />
			appointed by the Head of the State in consultation with the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			&quot;(b) The Chief Justice of a High Court shall be appointed by the
			<lb />
			Head of the State in consultation with the Head of the Unit and the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India.&quot;
			<lb />
			&quot;(c) Other judges of a High Court shall be appointed by the Head
			<lb />
			of the State in consultation with the Head of the Unit, the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of the High Court concerned and the Chief Justice of India.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			261. Our main object in making these recommendations is to secure the
			<lb />
			absolute independence of the High Court and to put them above party
			<lb />
			politics or influences. Without some such safeguards, it is not impossible
			<lb />
			that a Provincial Government may under political pressure affect
			<lb />
			prejudicially the strength of the High Court within its jurisdiction or the
			<lb />
			salary of its Judges. If it is urged that the High Court and the Government
			<lb />
			concerned will be more or less interested parties in the matter, the
			<lb />
			intervention of the Supreme Court and of the Head of the State would rule
			<lb />
			out all possibility of the exercise of political or party influences. The
			<lb />
			imposition of these conditions, may, on a superficial view, seem to be
			<lb />
			inconsistent with the theoretical autonomy of the Provinces, but, in our
			<lb />
			opinion, the independence of the High Court and of the judiciary generally
			<lb />
			is of supreme importance for the satisfactory working of the Constitution
			<lb />
			and nothing can be more detrimental to the well-being of a Province or
			<lb />
			calculated to undermine public confidence than the possibility of executive
			<lb />
			interference with the strength and independence of the highest tribunal of
			<lb />
			the Province.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			268. We now come to the method of appointment of Judges. Under the
			<lb />
			existing law Judges of High Courts and of the Federal Court are appointed
			<lb />
			by the Crown. We have recommended that the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			should be appointed by the Head of the State. In this connection we would
			<lb />
			refer to our discussion of the phrase &apos;Head of the State&apos; in Chapter VI.
			<lb />
			Similarly we have recommended that the other Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court shall be appointed by the Head of the State in consultation with the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India. The Chief Justice of a High Court shall be
			<lb />
			appointed by the Head of the State in consultation with the Head of the
			<lb />
			Unit and the Chief Justice of India, and the other judges of a High Court
			<lb />
			shall be appointed by the Head of the State in consultation with the Head
			<lb />
			of the Unit, the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned and the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India. We have deliberately placed the appointment of these
			<lb />
			Judges, including Judges of the Provincial High Courts outside the
			<lb />
			purview of party politics, and we make the same observations as above in
			<lb />
			justification of this provision notwithstanding its seeming interference with
			<lb />
			the theoretical autonomy of the Provinces.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			As mentioned, &apos;Head of State&apos; was discussed in Chapter VI of the
			<lb />
			Report and in so far as the judiciary is concerned, the Head of State was
			<lb />
			expected to act &apos;on his own&apos; as the occupant of the office of Head of State
			<lb />
			and not on the advice of the Federal Ministry. More specifically, the Head of
			<lb />
			State was to act on his/her own in the matter of appointment and removal of
			<lb />
			judges. This is what was said in the Report:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The Union will be a democratic federal State and the Head of the State
			<lb />
			who will replace both the Governor-General and the Crown Representative
			<lb />
			and might be given a suitable indigenous designation, if necessary should
			<lb />
			exercise such functions as are given to him only on the advice of his
			<lb />
			Federal Ministry, barring a few very exceptional cases, to be specifically
			<lb />
			mentioned in the Constitution Act, where discretion is given to him to act
			<lb />
			on his own or on advice other than that of the Federal Ministry (1) for
			<lb />
			avoiding political or communal graft, or (2) for taking the initiative in the
			<lb />
			national interest, especially in exceptional and fast moving situations such
			<lb />
			as exist at the present day. Under exception (1) will fall the suggestions
			<lb />
			we have made under paragraph 13 of our recommendations as regard the
			<lb />
			alteration of the strength of High Courts and the appointment and removal
			<lb />
			of judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts.&quot; 204
			<lb />
		</item>
		<head>
			Ad hoc Committee on the Supreme Court
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			10. After the Constituent Assembly was formed, an Ad hoc
			<lb />
			Committee on the Supreme Court was set up which presented its
			<lb />
			Report of 21 st May, 1947 to the Constituent Assembly. Paragraph 14 of the
			<lb />
			Report is of relevance to the issue of appointment of judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court. It accepted, in principle, the qualification for the appointment of
			<lb />
			judges to the Supreme Court, as mentioned in the Government of India Act,
			<lb />
			1935 but found it inexpedient &apos;to leave the power of appointing judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court to the unfettered discretion of the President of the Union.&apos; It
			<lb />
			made two suggestions in the appointment procedure, both of which
			<lb />
			necessitated consultation between the President and the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India and the opinion of a panel of 11 (eleven) persons comprising of, inter
			<lb />
			alia, some Chief Justices of the High Courts, some members of both the
			<lb />
			Houses of the Central Legislature and some law officers of the Union. It was
			<lb />
			proposed that the executive be kept out of the appointment process. The said
			<lb />
			paragraph reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;14. The qualifications of the judges of the Supreme Court may be laid
			<lb />
			down on terms very similar to those in the Act of 1935 as regards the
			<lb />
			judges of the Federal Court, the possibility being borne in mind (as in the
			<lb />
			Act of 1935) that judges of the superior courts even from the States which
			<lb />
			may join the Union may be found fit to occupy a seat in the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court. We do not think that it will be expedient to leave the power of
			<lb />
			appointing judges of the Supreme Court to the unfettered discretion of the
			<lb />
			President of the Union. We recommend that either of the following
			<lb />
			methods may be adopted. One method is that the President should in
			<lb />
			consultation with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (so far, as the
			<lb />
			appointment of puisne judges is concerned) nominate a person whom he
			<lb />
			considers fit to be appointed to the Supreme Court and the nomination
			<lb />
			should be confirmed by a majority of at least 7 out of a panel of 11
			<lb />
			composed of some of the Chief Justices of the High Courts of the
			<lb />
			constituent units, some members of both the Houses of the Central
			<lb />
			Legislature and some of the law officers of the Union. The other method is
			<lb />
			that the panel of 11 should recommend three names out of which the
			<lb />
			President, in consultation with the Chief Justice, may select a judge for the
			<lb />
			appointment. The same procedure should be followed for the appointment
			<lb />
			of the Chief Justice except of course that in this case there will be no
			<lb />
			consultation with the Chief Justice. To ensure that the panel will be both
			<lb />
			independent [and] command confidence the panel should not be an ad hoc
			<lb />
			body but must be one appointed for a term of years.&quot; 205
			<lb />
			11. There was clearly a divergence of opinion between the Sapru
			<lb />
			Committee and the Ad hoc Committee on the consultation process for the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges. The Sapru Committee felt that the appointment of
			<lb />
			judges should be left to the Head of State acting on his/her own while the Ad
			<lb />
			hoc Committee did not approve of the appointment process being left to the
			<lb />
			&apos;unfettered discretion of the President&apos; but suggested it to be broad-based
			<lb />
			involving a panel.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			12. However, what is apparent from both the Report of the Sapru
			<lb />
			Committee and the Report of the Ad hoc Committee is that the executive was
			<lb />
			not to be involved at all in the process of appointment of judges. This is of
			<lb />
			considerable significance. 206
			<lb />

		<head>
			Memorandum on the Union Constitution and Draft
			<lb />
			Clauses
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			13. On 30 th May, 1947 the Constitutional Advisor to the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly, Sir B.N. Rau submitted a Memorandum on the Union
			<lb />
			Constitution and Draft Clauses. The Memorandum provided in
			<lb />
			Chapter VI (The Union Judicature) that there shall be a Supreme Court &apos;with
			<lb />
			powers and jurisdiction as recommended by the ad hoc Committee on the
			<lb />
			Union Judiciary.&apos; 207 In the draft clauses of the Union Constitution appended
			<lb />
			to the Memorandum, it was provided that every judge of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			shall be appointed by the President with the approval of not less than 2/3 rd of
			<lb />
			the members of the Council of State. 208 In this regard, the Law Commission
			<lb />
			of India notes in its 80 th Report as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The Constitutional Adviser, in his memorandum dated May 30 th , 1947
			<lb />
			suggested that the appointment of Judges should be made by the President
			<lb />
			with the approval of at least two-thirds of the Council of State. The
			<lb />
			Council of State, according to him, was to be a body in the nature of a
			<lb />
			Privy Council for advising the President on certain matters on which
			<lb />
			decisions were required on independent non-party lines. The Council of
			<lb />
			State was to include the Chief Justice of India among its members and its
			<lb />
			composition was to be such as to secure freedom from party bias. Such a
			<lb />
			Council of State, it was suggested by the Constitutional Adviser, would be
			<lb />
			a satisfactory substitute for the panel recommended by the Special
			<lb />
			Committee.
			<lb />
			The Union Constitution Committee did not accept the proposal of the
			<lb />
			Constitutional Adviser for setting up of a Council of State, and suggested
			<lb />
			that the procedure for the appointment of judges should be that the
			<lb />
			President should consult the Chief Justice and such other judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court as might be necessary.&quot; 209
			<lb />
			14. It appears that by this time, the independence of the judiciary was
			<lb />
			taken for granted, the only question being the procedure for the appointment
			<lb />
			of judges -whether it should be the exclusive responsibility of the President
			<lb />
			or it should be broad-based involving a panel or a Council of State. In any
			<lb />
			event, the exclusion of the executive in the appointment process appears to
			<lb />
			have been taken as accepted.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Union Constitution Committee
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			15. The Union Constitution Committee which presented a Report
			<lb />
			to the Constituent Assembly on 4 th July, 1947 did not adopt the proposal for
			<lb />
			setting up a Council of State. Consequently, an alternative procedure for the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court was suggested, namely, for the
			<lb />
			appointment by consultation between the President and the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court and such other judges of the Supreme Court and judges
			<lb />
			of the High Court as may be necessary.
			<lb />
			In other words, the limited
			<lb />
			consultative process as originally envisaged by the Sapru Committee
			<lb />
			(between the President and the Chief Justice of India) was accepted though
			<lb />
			with modifications. Chapter IV paragraph 18 of the Report concerns itself
			<lb />
			with the appointment of judges of the Supreme Court and this reads as
			<lb />
			follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;18. Supreme Court.--There shall be a Supreme Court with the
			<lb />
			constitution, powers and jurisdiction recommended by the ad
			<lb />
			hoc Committee on the Union Judiciary, except that a judge of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court shall be appointed by the President after consulting the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			and such other judges of the Supreme Court as also judges of the High
			<lb />
			Courts as may be necessary for the purpose.
			<lb />
			[NOTE -The ad hoc Committee on the Supreme Court has
			<lb />
			observed that it will not be expedient to leave the power of appointing
			<lb />
			judges of the Supreme Court to the unfettered discretion of the President of
			<lb />
			the Federation. They have suggested two alternatives, both of which
			<lb />
			involve the setting up of a special panel of eleven members. According to
			<lb />
			one alternative, the President, in consultation with the Chief Justice, is to
			<lb />
			nominate a person for appointment as puisne judge and the nomination has
			<lb />
			to be confirmed by at least seven members of the panel. According to the
			<lb />
			other alternative, the panel should recommend three names, out of which
			<lb />
			the President, in consultation with the Chief Justice, is to select one for the
			<lb />
			appointment. The provision suggested in the above clause follows the
			<lb />
			decision of the Union Constitution Committee.]&quot; 210
			<lb />
			Again, the executive had no role to play in the appointment of judges,
			<lb />
			specifically of the Supreme Court.

		<p>
			16. With regard to the High Courts, a Report of 27 th June, 1947 was
			<lb />
			submitted to the Constituent Assembly by the Provincial Constitution
			<lb />
			Committee. Part II thereof pertained to the Provincial Judiciary and the
			<lb />
			recommendations made for the appointment of judges of the High Court
			<lb />
			incorporated the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935 and the
			<lb />
			recommendations made by the Union Constitution Committee. These read as
			<lb />
			follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The Provincial Judiciary
			<lb />
			1. The provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, relating to the
			<lb />
			High Court should be adopted mutatis mutandis; but judges should be
			<lb />
			appointed by the President of the Federation in consultation with the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of the Supreme Court, the Governor of the Province and the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of the High Court of the Province (except when the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			the High Court himself is to be appointed).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			2. The judges of the High Court shall receive such emoluments and
			<lb />
			allowances as may be determined by Act of the Provincial Legislature and
			<lb />
			until then such as are prescribed in Schedule............
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3. The emoluments and allowances of the judges shall not be diminished
			<lb />
			during their term of office.&quot; 211
			<lb />
			The above discussion indicates that the executive was to be kept out of the
			<lb />
			process of appointing judges to the Supreme Court and the High Courts. This
			<lb />
			is clear from the views of: (1) The Sapru Committee; (2) The Ad hoc
			<lb />
			Committee on the Supreme Court; (3) The Union Constitution Committee,
			<lb />
			and (4) The Provincial Constitution Committee. This will have some bearing
			<lb />
			when the composition of the National Judicial Appointments Commission is
			<lb />
			examined.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			17. In this background pertaining to the judiciary, the first draft of the
			<lb />
			Constitution was placed before the Drafting Committee in October, 1947.
			<lb />
			This was followed by another (revised) draft submitted to the President of
			<lb />
			the Constituent Assembly on 21 st February, 1948. There was no significant
			<lb />
			change between these two drafts as far the appointment process for the
			<lb />
			Federal Judicature (or the High Courts in the Provinces/States) is concerned.
			<lb />
			But, it is important to note that the Drafting Committee did not throw
			<lb />
			overboard the view of any of the committees mentioned above, that is, to
			<lb />
			keep the executive out of the process of appointment of judges.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Conference of Chief Justices
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			18. Wide publicity was given to the Draft Constitution to enable interested
			<lb />
			persons to express their views through comments and suggestions. The views
			<lb />
			expressed by the Conference of Chief Justices (the Chief Justice of the
			<lb />
			Federal Court and Chief Justices of the High Courts), the Minorities
			<lb />
			Sub-Committee and the Advisory Committee on Fundamental Rights,
			<lb />
			Minorities and Tribal and Excluded Areas are important since they explain
			<lb />
			the interplay between the Executive and the Judiciary in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of judges.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19. These views also make it clear that almost immediately after
			<lb />
			Independence (or thereabouts) the executive began to interfere in the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges of the High Courts. This interference by the executive
			<lb />
			(or in the present day language, the political executive) is the genesis of the
			<lb />
			problem that we are grappling with even today.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			20. The Conference of Chief Justices was held on 26 th and 27 th March,
			<lb />
			1948 to consider the proposals in the Draft Constitution concerning the
			<lb />
			judiciary. A Memorandum representing the views of the Federal Court and
			<lb />
			of the Chief Justices representing all the Provincial High Courts of the Union
			<lb />
			of India was prepared and submitted by the Conference. 212 This
			<lb />
			Memorandum is of immense importance in understanding the prevailing
			<lb />
			appointment process.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			212 The text of the Memorandum is available in B. Shiva Rao: &apos;The Framing of India&apos;s Constitution&apos; -Select
			<lb />
			Documents, Volume IV page 193
			<lb />
			Page 592
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			21. Very briefly, in what may be described as the &apos;preamble&apos; to the
			<lb />
			Memorandum, a few salient points were assumed and noticed. It was
			<lb />
			assumed that the independence and integrity of the judiciary is of the
			<lb />
			&apos;highest importance&apos; not only to the judges but to the citizens seeking resort
			<lb />
			from a court of law against the high handed and illegal exercise of power by
			<lb />
			the executive. It was noticed that there is a tendency to whittle down the
			<lb />
			powers, rights and authority of the judiciary which, if allowed to continue,
			<lb />
			would be &apos;most unfortunate&apos;. Therefore, there was a need to counteract this
			<lb />
			tendency which was likely to grow with greater power being placed in the
			<lb />
			hands of the political parties. It was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;We have assumed that it is recognized on all hands that the independence
			<lb />
			and integrity of the judiciary in a democratic system of government is of
			<lb />
			the highest importance and interest not only to the judges but to the
			<lb />
			citizens at large who may have to seek redress in the last resort in courts of
			<lb />
			law against any illegal acts or the high-handed exercise of power by the
			<lb />
			executive. Thanks to the system of administration of justice established by
			<lb />
			the British in this country, the judiciary until now has, in the main, played
			<lb />
			and independent role in protecting the rights of the individual citizen
			<lb />
			against encroachment and invasion by the executive power. Unfortunately,
			<lb />
			however, a tendency has, of late, been noticeable to detract from the status
			<lb />
			and dignity of the judiciary and to whittle down their powers, rights an
			<lb />
			authority which if unchecked would be most unfortunate. While we
			<lb />
			recognize that the Draft Constitution proposes to liberalize in some
			<lb />
			respects the existing safeguards against executive interference and to
			<lb />
			enlarge their present powers, it is felt that further provision should be made
			<lb />
			in the same direction in order effectively to counteract the aforesaid
			<lb />
			tendency which is bound to become more pronounced as more power
			<lb />
			passes into the hands of political parties who will control and dominate the
			<lb />
			governmental machinery in the years to come. In making the following
			<lb />
			proposals and suggestions, the paramount importance of securing the
			<lb />
			fearless functioning of an independent, incorruptible and efficient judiciary
			<lb />
			has been steadily kept in view.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The Memorandum specifically pointed out (sadly) that after 15 th August,
			<lb />
			1947 the appointment of judges to the High Courts, on merit, was not always
			<lb />
			assured in view of the practice followed (by some States). Also,
			<lb />
			recommendations by the Chief Justice of the High Court were not always
			<lb />
			forwarded to the Central Government, implying thereby that some other
			<lb />
			recommendations were forwarded. In this regard it was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Discussions at the conference revealed that the procedure followed after
			<lb />
			15 th August 1947 does not in practice always ensure appointment being
			<lb />
			made purely on merit without political, communal and party
			<lb />
			considerations being imported into the matter. Though it is acknowledged
			<lb />
			readily enough in principle that such considerations should not influence
			<lb />
			the appointment, this is not always kept in view in working the procedure
			<lb />
			in practice. The Chief Justice sends his recommendation to the Premier
			<lb />
			who consults his Home Minister. The recommendation of the Premier is
			<lb />
			then forwarded to the Home Ministry at the Centre without even sending
			<lb />
			the recommendation of the Chief Justice along with it, the prescribed
			<lb />
			procedure being apparently understood as not rendering it obligatory for
			<lb />
			the Premier to do so.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			22. Consequently, a modified procedure for making recommendations was
			<lb />
			unanimously recommended by the Conference which would ensure that the
			<lb />
			recommendation of the Chief Justice reaches the President and that the
			<lb />
			appointment be made with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India to
			<lb />
			avoid any political pressures. It was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The Chief Justice should send his recommendation in that behalf directly
			<lb />
			to the President. After consultation with the Governor the President should
			<lb />
			make the appointment with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
			This procedure would obviate the need for the Chief Justice of the High
			<lb />
			Court discussing the matter with the Premier and his Home Minister and
			<lb />
			&quot;justifying&quot; his recommendations before them. It would also ensure the
			<lb />
			recommendation of the Chief Justice of the High Court being always
			<lb />
			placed before the appointing authority, namely, the President. The
			<lb />
			necessity for obtaining the &quot;concurrence&quot; of the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			would provide a safeguard against political and party pressure at the
			<lb />
			highest level being brought to bear in the matter.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			23. Significantly, the Memorandum tacitly and implicitly acknowledged
			<lb />
			that apart from a recommendation for the appointment of a judge of a High
			<lb />
			Court originating from the Chief Justice of the High Court, recommendations
			<lb />
			were being made by or at the instance of the political executive. Whether
			<lb />
			such a procedure was right or wrong was not considered but it was suggested
			<lb />
			that in the event of such a recommendation being made, the concurrence of
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India should be obtained before the appointment is made.
			<lb />
			The Memorandum proposed that Article 193(1) of the Draft Constitution
			<lb />
			concerning the appointment of a judge of a High Court should read as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Every judge of the High Court shall be appointed by the President by a
			<lb />
			warrant under his hand and seal on the recommendation of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of the High Court after consultation with the Governor of the State
			<lb />
			and with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India …&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The Memorandum acknowledged that a recommendation for the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge of the High Court could also be made by the
			<lb />
			President (in an individual capacity). In the event of such a proposal (by the
			<lb />
			President), there was no likelihood of the Chief Justice of India not accepting
			<lb />
			it and, therefore, the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India was not
			<lb />
			required to be incorporated in the Constitution. It was, therefore, noted:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;We do not think it necessary to make any provision in the Constitution for
			<lb />
			the possibility of the Chief Justice of India refusing to concur in an
			<lb />
			appointment proposed by the President. Both are officers of the highest
			<lb />
			responsibility and so far no case of such refusal has arisen although a
			<lb />
			convention now exists that such appointments should be made after
			<lb />
			referring the matter to the Chief Justice of India and obtaining his
			<lb />
			concurrence. If per chance such a situation were ever to arise it could of
			<lb />
			course be met by the President making a different proposal, and no express
			<lb />
			provision need, it seems to us, be made in that behalf.
			<lb />
			The foregoing applies mutatis mutandis to the appointment of the judges
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court, and article 103(2) may also be suitably
			<lb />
			modified…..&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			24. The significance of this Memorandum cannot be overemphasized and
			<lb />
			it can be summarized as follows: (1) The independence and integrity of the
			<lb />
			judiciary was of the highest importance. (2) A tendency had developed in the
			<lb />
			executive to whittle down the power and authority of the judiciary. (3) It was
			<lb />
			noted that recommendations for the appointment of a judge of a High Court
			<lb />
			originate from the Chief Justice of the High Court. Occasionally, such
			<lb />
			recommendations are suppressed by the executive at the provincial level. It
			<lb />
			was proposed that recommendations made by the Chief Justice ought to be
			<lb />
			forwarded directly to the President for being processed so that the political
			<lb />
			executive at the provincial level cannot suppress it. (4) It was acknowledged
			<lb />
			that the political executive at the provincial level also makes
			<lb />
			recommendations (though not always on merits) directly to the Central
			<lb />
			Government, without the knowledge of the Chief Justice of the High Court.
			<lb />
			Such recommendations ought to be accepted only with the concurrence of
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India, and this should be taken care of in the Draft
			<lb />
			Constitution. (5) It was acknowledged that a recommendation for the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge of a High Court (or the Supreme Court) could be
			<lb />
			made by the President (personally -&apos;Both are officers of the highest
			<lb />
			responsibility…..&apos;). This would normally be accepted by the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India and therefore no provision for the concurrence of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India was required to be made in this regard in the Draft Constitution.
			<lb />
			However, if the Chief Justice of India were to refuse to accept the
			<lb />
			recommendation, the situation could be met by the President making a
			<lb />
			different proposal. This is because, it was noted, that &apos;a convention now
			<lb />
			exists that such appointments should be made after referring the matter to the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India and obtaining his concurrence.&apos;

			Amendments to Article 61 and Article 62 of the Draft Constitution
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			25. The Minorities Sub-Committee and the Advisory Committee on
			<lb />
			Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribal and Excluded Areas adverted to
			<lb />
			and considered Article 61 and Article 62 (amongst others) of the Draft
			<lb />
			Constitution. Article 61 and Article 62 of the Draft Constitution pertain to
			<lb />
			the Council of Ministers to aid and advice the President and other provisions
			<lb />
			as to Ministers. In this regard, Shiva Rao mentions in his excellent effort
			<lb />
			&apos;The Framing of India&apos;s Constitution -A Study&apos; as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;There was considerable discussion in the Minorities Sub-Committee and
			<lb />
			in the Advisory Committee on Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribal
			<lb />
			and Excluded Areas on the need for the inclusion of minority
			<lb />
			representatives in the Union and State Cabinets…….. They considered that
			<lb />
			it would be sufficient if, following the precedent furnished by the
			<lb />
			Government of India Act of 1935, an Instrument of Instructions was drawn
			<lb />
			up, to be included as a schedule to the Constitution, enjoining the
			<lb />
			Governors and the President as far as practicable to include members of
			<lb />
			the minority communities in their Ministries. In the Draft Constitution of
			<lb />
			February 1948, however, an Instrument of Instructions for this purpose
			<lb />
			was drawn up only for Governors but not for the President. Possibly in
			<lb />
			order to rectify this omission, the Drafting Committee decided, on further
			<lb />
			consideration of the articles relating to the Council of Ministers, that an
			<lb />
			Instrument of Instructions for the President would also be necessary&quot; 213
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			26. Apparently, pursuant to this, the Drafting Committee gave a notice in
			<lb />
			October 1948 of an amendment to Article 62 proposing to add the following
			<lb />
			clause:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;In the choice of his Ministers and the exercise of his other functions under
			<lb />
			this Constitution, the President shall be generally guided by the
			<lb />
			Instructions set out in Schedule III-A, but the validity of anything done by
			<lb />
			the President shall not be called in question on the ground that it was done
			<lb />
			otherwise than in accordance with such Instructions.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			27. Schedule III-A incorporated the Instrument of Instructions to the
			<lb />
			President and this is important and it reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			New Schedule III-A
			<lb />
			[Article 62(5a)]
			<lb />
			INSTRUCTIONS TO THE PRESIDENT

			<lb />
			of Parliament to be elected by both Houses in accordance with the system
			<lb />
			of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote for

		<item>
			(2) The President shall also consult the Advisory Board so constituted in

			making appointment by virtue of the powers conferred on him by this
			<lb />
			Constitution to any other office under the Government of India or the
			<lb />
			Government of a State other than the office of Governor of a State, if

			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			6. (1) In making appointment of judges of the Supreme Court and of the
			<lb />
			High Courts, the President shall before obtaining the advice of the
			<lb />
			Advisory Board shall follow the following procedure:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) In the case of appointment of the Chief Justice of India, he shall consult
			<lb />
			the judges of the Supreme Court and the Chief Justices of the High Courts
			<lb />
			within the territory of India except the States for the time being specified
			<lb />
			in Part III of the First Schedule.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) In the case of appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court other than
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India, he shall consult the Chief Justice of India and
			<lb />
			the other judges of the Supreme Court and also the Chief Justices of the
			<lb />
			High Courts within the territory of India except the States for the time
			<lb />
			being specified in Part III of the First Schedule.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(c) In the case of appointment of the Chief Justice of a High Court, he shall
			<lb />
			consult the Governor of the State in which the High Court has its principal
			<lb />
			seat, and the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(d) In the case of appointment of a judge of a High Court other than the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice, he shall consult the Governor of the State in which the High
			<lb />
			Court has its principal seat, the Chief Justice of India and the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of the High Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(2) The President shall place the recommendations of the authorities
			<lb />
			consulted by him under sub-paragraph (1) before the Advisory Board at the
			<lb />
			time of obtaining the advice of that Board with regard to any appointment
			<lb />
			referred to in that sub-paragraph.

			28. It is significant that the Instrument of Instructions also kept the
			<lb />
			executive completely out of the picture in so far as the appointment of judges
			<lb />
			is concerned. No one from the executive was to be consulted or involved in
			<lb />
			the appointment process.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			29. The Drafting Committee also proposed, apparently in view of the
			<lb />
			insertion of Schedule III-A that Article 103(2) of the Draft Constitution
			<lb />
			(relating to the appointment of judges of the Supreme Court and
			<lb />
			corresponding to Article 124(2) of the Constitution of India) 215 be modified
			<lb />
			as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			214 The Framing of India&apos;s Constitution -Select Documents, Volume -IV, Page 84.
			<lb />
			215 Article 103(2) of the Draft Constitution reads: &quot;Every judge of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by
			<lb />
			the President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with such of the judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court and of the High Courts in the States as may be necessary for the purpose and shall hold office until he
			<lb />
			attains the age of sixty-five years:
			<lb />
			Provided that in the case of appointment of a judge, other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India shall always be consulted.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Page
		</p>
		<p>
			599
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;(i) the words &quot;after consultation with such of the judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the States as may be
			<lb />
			necessary for the purpose&quot; be deleted in clause (2); and
			<lb />
			(ii) the first proviso to clause (2) be deleted .&quot; 216
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			30. In other words, the President was not expected to consult the Council
			<lb />
			of Ministers at all or to act on its advice but was to consult the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India and other judges and then take the advice of the Advisory Board.
			<lb />
			This was a mixture of the Sapru Committee recommendation of the Head of
			<lb />
			State (or President as the high office came to be designated) acting on his/her
			<lb />
			own and yet the President not having &apos;unfettered discretion&apos; in the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			31. All the proposals, including those given by the Conference of Chief
			<lb />
			Justices, the Minorities Sub-Committee and the Advisory Committee on
			<lb />
			Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribal and Excluded Areas, were
			<lb />
			considered by the Drafting Committee and on 4 th November, 1948 the second
			<lb />
			draft of the Constitution was introduced in the Constituent Assembly by Dr.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			B.R. Ambedkar, Chairman of the Drafting Committee. However, the decision
			<lb />
			of the Drafting Committee taken in October, 1948 was not incorporated in
			<lb />
			the Draft Constitution. Therefore, Dr. Ambedkar moved an amendment in the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly on 31 st December, 1948 to insert clause (5)a in Article
			<lb />
			62 of the Draft Constitution. The amendment proposed by Dr. Ambedkar
			<lb />
			reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;That after clause 5 of Article 62 the following new clause be inserted:-
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(5)a In the choice of his Ministers and the exercise of his other functions
			<lb />
			under this Constitution, the President shall be generally guided by the
			<lb />
			instructions set out in Schedule III-A, but the validity of anything done by
			<lb />
			the President shall not be called in question on the ground that it was done
			<lb />
			otherwise than in accordance with such instructions.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			32. The amendment was discussed briefly and adopted by the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly on the same day. Although the decision of the Drafting Committee
			<lb />
			was to insert clause (5)a in Article 62 of the Draft Constitution and
			<lb />
			simultaneously delete a part of clause (2) of Article 103 of the Draft
			<lb />
			Constitution, the amendment relating to the deletion of clause (2) of Article
			<lb />
			103 of the Draft Constitution was apparently not moved by Dr. Ambedkar. It
			<lb />
			is not clear why. As far as the Instrument of Instructions is concerned, it is
			<lb />
			pointed out by Granville Austin that it was not actually, but implicitly,
			<lb />
			adopted by the Constituent Assembly. 217
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			33. A combined reading of the views of the Drafting Committee read with
			<lb />
			the Instrument of Instructions and the insertion of clause (5)a in Article 62 of
			<lb />
			the Draft Constitution indicates that the thinking at the time was that in the
			<lb />
			matter of appointment of judges the President was to act in his/her individual
			<lb />
			capacity. This is very significant otherwise there was absolutely no need for
			<lb />
			an Instrument of Instructions or an Advisory Board to be set up or for the
			<lb />
			complete exclusion of the Council of Ministers or the executive in the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges. However, this thinking was later on given up.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Constituent Assembly Debates
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			34. This historical background has an impact on understanding the
			<lb />
			subsequent debate in the Constituent Assembly that took place on 23 rd and
			<lb />
			24 th May, 1949 when Article 103 of the Draft Constitution was considered
			<lb />
			and debated in the Constituent Assembly. It needs to be emphasized at this
			<lb />
			stage that when the debate took place on 23 rd and 24 th May, 1949 it was in the
			<lb />
			backdrop of the fact that clause (5)a had already been inserted in Article 62
			<lb />
			of the Draft Constitution to the effect that in respect of several matters,
			<lb />
			including the appointment of judges, the President would act in his/her
			<lb />
			individual capacity and the Council of Ministers was not even in the picture.
			<lb />
			The debate will be referred to a little later.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			35. After a few months, on 11 th October, 1949 the President of the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly was informed by Mr. T.T. Krishnamachari that
			<lb />
			Schedule III-A is not being moved and that it could be taken out of the list.
			<lb />
			He also moved for the deletion of Schedule IV from the Draft Constitution.
			<lb />
			Explaining the move to delete Schedule IV from the Draft Constitution it
			<lb />
			was stated that the matter should be left entirely to convention rather than be
			<lb />
			put in the body of the Constitution as a Schedule in the shape of an
			<lb />
			Instrument of Instructions and that there is a fairly large volume of opinion
			<lb />
			which favours that idea.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			36. Dr. Ambedkar added as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Sir, with regard to the Instrument of Instructions, there are two points
			<lb />
			which have to be borne in mind. The purpose of the Instrument of
			<lb />
			Instructions as was originally devised in the British Constitution for the
			<lb />
			Government of the colonies was to give certain directions to the head of
			<lb />
			the States as to how they should exercise their discretionary powers that
			<lb />
			were vested in them. Now the Instrument of Instructions were effective in
			<lb />
			so far as the particular Governor or Viceroy to whom these instructions
			<lb />
			were given was subject to the authority of the Secretary of State. If in any
			<lb />
			particular matter which was of a serious character, the Governor for
			<lb />
			instance, persistently refused to carry out the Instrument of Instructions
			<lb />
			issued to him, it was open to the Secretary of State to remove him, and
			<lb />
			appoint another and thereby secure the effective carrying out of the
			<lb />
			Instrument of Instructions. So far as our Constitution is concerned, there is
			<lb />
			no functionary created by it who can see that these Instruments of
			<lb />
			Instructions is carried out faithfully by the Governor.
			<lb />
			Secondly, the discretion which we are going to leave with the Governor
			<lb />
			under this Constitution is very very meagre. He has hardly any discretion
			<lb />
			at all. He has to act on the advice of the Prime Minister in the matter of
			<lb />
			the selection of Members of the Cabinet. He has also to act on the advice
			<lb />
			of the Prime Minister and his Ministers of State with respect to any
			<lb />
			particular executive or legislative action that he takes. That being so,
			<lb />
			supposing the Prime Minister does not propose, for any special reason or
			<lb />
			circumstances, to include in his Cabinet members of the minority
			<lb />
			community, there is nothing which the Governor can do, notwithstanding
			<lb />
			the fact that we shall be charging him through this particular Instrument of
			<lb />
			Instructions to act in a particular manner. It is therefore felt, having regard
			<lb />
			under the Constitution who can enforce this, that no such directions should
			<lb />
			be given. They are useless and can serve no particular purpose. Therefore,
			<lb />
			it was felt in the circumstances it is not desirable to have such Instrument
			<lb />
			of Instructions which really can be effective in a different set of
			<lb />
			circumstances which can by no stretch of imagination be deemed to exist
			<lb />
			after the new Constitution comes into existence. That is the principal
			<lb />
			reason why it is felt that this Instrument of Instructions is undesirable.&quot; 218
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			37. On the basis of the above discussion, Schedule IV to the Draft
			<lb />
			Constitution was deleted and a motion to that effect was adopted.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			38. Thereafter on 14 th October, 1949 an amendment was moved by Mr.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			T.T. Krishnamachari to omit clause (5)a of Article 62 of the Draft
			<lb />
			Constitution. It was stated that since Schedule III-A was not moved, this
			<lb />
			clause becomes superfluous and therefore its omission was moved. The
			<lb />
			amendment to omit clause (5)a of Article 62 of the Draft Constitution was
			<lb />
			adopted. In support of this, Dr. Ambedkar [perhaps the main advocate of
			<lb />
			clause (5)a] had this to say, while emphasizing constitutional obligations and
			<lb />
			constitutional conventions:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Every Constitution, so far as it relates to what we call parliamentary
			<lb />
			democracy, requires three different organs of the State, the executive, the
			<lb />
			judiciary and the legislature. I have not anywhere found in any
			<lb />
			Constitution a provision saying that the executive shall obey the
			<lb />
			legislature, nor have I found anywhere in any Constitution a provision that
			<lb />
			the executive shall obey the judiciary. Nowhere is such a provision to be
			<lb />
			found. That is because it is generally understood that the provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution are binding upon the different organs of the State.
			<lb />
			Consequently, it is to be presumed that those who work the Constitution,
			<lb />
			those who compose the Legislature and those who compose the executive
			<lb />
			and the judiciary know their functions, their limitations and their duties. It
			<lb />
			is therefore to be expected that if the executive is honest in working the
			<lb />
			Constitution, then the executive is bound to obey the Legislature without
			<lb />
			any kind of compulsory obligation laid down in the Constitution.
			<lb />
			Similarly, if the executive is honest in working the Constitution, it must act
			<lb />
			in accordance with the judicial decisions given by the Supreme Court.
			<lb />
			Therefore my submission is that this is a matter of one organ of the State
			<lb />
			acting within its own limitations and obeying the supremacy of the other
			<lb />
			organs of the State. In so far as the Constitution gives a supremacy to that
			<lb />
			is a matter of constitutional obligation which is implicit in the Constitution
			<lb />
			itself.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			I remember, Sir, that you raised this question and I looked it up and I had
			<lb />
			with me two decisions of the King&apos;s Bench Division which I wanted one
			<lb />
			day to bring here and refer in the House so as to make the point quite clear.
			<lb />
			But I am sorry I had no notice today of this point being raised. But this is
			<lb />
			the answer to the question that has been raised.
			<lb />
			No constitutional Government can function in any country unless any
			<lb />
			particular constitutional authority remembers the fact that its authority is
			<lb />
			limited by the Constitution and that if there is any authority created by the
			<lb />
			Constitution which has to decide between that particular authority and any
			<lb />
			other authority, then the decision of that authority shall be binding upon
			<lb />
			any other organ. That is the sanction which this Constitution gives in order
			<lb />
			to see that the President shall follow the advice of his Ministers, that the
			<lb />
			executive shall not exceed in its executive authority the law made by
			<lb />
			Parliament and that the executive shall not give its own interpretation of
			<lb />
			the law which is in conflict with the interpretation of the judicial organ
			<lb />
			created by the Constitution.
			<lb />
			Shri H V. Kamath : If in any particular case the President does not act upon
			<lb />
			the advice of his Council of Ministers, will that be tantamount to a
			<lb />
			violation of the Constitution and will he be liable to impeachment ?
			<lb />
			The Honourable Dr. B. R. Ambedkar: There is not the slightest doubt about
			<lb />
			it.&quot; 219
			<lb />
			Referring to this extremely important exposition, Granville Austin
			<lb />
			concludes:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;From this, one is forced to deduce that Ambedkar and the members of the
			<lb />
			Drafting Committee, perhaps under pressure from Nehru or Patel, had
			<lb />
			come to the conclusion that the written provisions of a non-justiciable
			<lb />
			Instrument of Instructions and the tacit conventions of cabinet government
			<lb />
			had equal value: both were legally unenforceable, but both provided a
			<lb />
			mechanism by which the legislature could control the Executive; and of
			<lb />
			the two, conventions were the tidiest and the simplest way of limiting
			<lb />
			Executive authority.&quot; 220
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Transposing this to the relationship between the Judiciary and the Executive,
			<lb />
			it is quite clear that Dr. Ambedkar and indeed the Constituent Assembly was
			<lb />
			of the view that constitutional obligations and constitutional conventions
			<lb />
			must be respected, unwritten though they may be. And, one of these
			<lb />
			constitutional obligations and constitutional conventions is that the view of
			<lb />
			the judiciary must be respected by the executive not only with respect to
			<lb />
			judicial decisions but also in other matters that directly impact on the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Debates on 23 rd and 24 th May, 1949
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			39. It is important to appreciate that the Constituent Assembly Debates
			<lb />
			(for short the CAD) to which our attention was drawn refer to the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court and not specifically to the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge of a High Court. But the sum and substance of the
			<lb />
			debate is equally applicable to the appointment of a judge of a High Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			40. On 23 rd and 24 th May, 1949 three significant amendments to Article
			<lb />
			103(2) of the Draft Constitution relating to the appointment of judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court were considered in the Constituent Assembly. The first was
			<lb />
			moved by Prof. K.T. Shah (Bihar: General) who suggested that the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court should be after consultation
			<lb />
			with the Council of State. This suggestion was intended to avoid political
			<lb />
			influence, party maneuvers and pressures in the appointment process. The
			<lb />
			second was moved by Prof. Shibban Lal Saksena (United Provinces:
			<lb />
			General) who suggested that the appointment of the Chief Justice of India be
			<lb />
			subject to confirmation by two-thirds majority of the total number of
			<lb />
			Members of Parliament assembled in a joint session of both the Houses of
			<lb />
			Parliament. The third was moved by Mr. B. Pocker Sahib (Madras: Muslim)
			<lb />
			who suggested that the appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court should
			<lb />
			have the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India. In support of his
			<lb />
			amendment Mr. B. Pocker Sahib extensively referred to and relied on the
			<lb />
			Memorandum submitted by the Conference of Chief Justices. As he put it:
			<lb />
			&quot;I submit, Sir, the views expressed by the Federal Court and the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of the various High Courts assembled in conference are entitled to
			<lb />
			the highest weight before this Assembly, before this provision is passed. It
			<lb />
			is of the highest importance that the Judges of the Supreme Court should
			<lb />
			not be made to feel that their existence or their appointment is dependent
			<lb />
			upon political considerations or on the will of the political party.
			<lb />
			Therefore, it is essential that there should be sufficient safeguards against
			<lb />
			political influence being brought to bear on such appointments. Of course,
			<lb />
			if a Judge owes his appointment to a political party, certainly in the course
			<lb />
			of his career as a Judge, also as an ordinary human being, he will certainly
			<lb />
			be bound to have some consideration for the political views of the
			<lb />
			authority that has appointed him. That the Judges should be above all these
			<lb />
			political considerations cannot be denied. Therefore, I submit that one of
			<lb />
			the chief conditions mentioned in the procedure laid down, that is the
			<lb />
			concurrence of the Chief Justice of India in the appointment of the Judges
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court, must be fulfilled. This has been insisted upon in this
			<lb />
			memo. and that is a very salutary principle which should be accepted by
			<lb />
			this House. I submit, Sir, that it is of the highest importance that the
			<lb />
			President must not only consult the Chief Justice of India, but his
			<lb />
			concurrence should be obtained before his colleagues, that is the Judges of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court, are appointed. It has been very emphatically stated in
			<lb />
			this memo. that it is absolutely necessary to keep them above political
			<lb />
			influences. No doubt, it is said in this procedure that the Governor of the
			<lb />
			State also may be consulted; but that is a matter of minor importance. It is
			<lb />
			likely that the Governor may also have some political inclinations.
			<lb />
			Therefore, my amendment has omitted the name of the Governor. That the
			<lb />
			judiciary should be above all political parties and above all political
			<lb />
			consideration cannot be denied. I do not want to enter into the controversy
			<lb />
			at present, which was debated yesterday, as to the necessity for the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary so far as the executive is concerned. It is a
			<lb />
			matter which should receive very serious consideration at the hands of this
			<lb />
			House and I hope the Honourable the Law Minister will also pay serious
			<lb />
			attention to this aspect of the question, particularly in view of the fact that
			<lb />
			this recommendation has been made by the Federal Court and the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of the other High Court assembled in conference. I do not think,
			<lb />
			Sir, that there can be any higher authority on this subject than this
			<lb />
			conference of the Federal Court and the Chief Justices of the various High
			<lb />
			Courts in India.&quot; 221
			<lb />
			Mr. Mahboob Ali Baig Sahib (Madras: Muslim) moved a somewhat similar
			<lb />
			amendment. The reason given by Mr. Mahboob Ali Baig Sahib was:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Under our proposed constitution the President would be the constitutional
			<lb />
			Head of the executive. And the constitution envisages what is called a
			<lb />
			parliamentary democracy. So the President would be guided by the Prime
			<lb />
			Minister or the Council of Ministers who are necessarily drawn from a
			<lb />
			political party. Therefore the decision of the President would be
			<lb />
			necessarily influenced by party considerations. It is therefore necessary
			<lb />
			that the concurrence of the Chief Justice is made a pre-requisite for the
			<lb />
			appointment of a Judge of the Supreme Court in order to guard ourselves
			<lb />
			against party influences that may be brought to bear upon the appointment
			<lb />
			of Judges.&quot; 222
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			41. It is clear that both these Hon&apos;ble Members made the &apos;concurrence&apos;
			<lb />
			suggestion since they desired the appointment of a judge of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court to be free from any sort of political or executive interference. It
			<lb />
			appears that these amendments were moved unmindful of the insertion of
			<lb />
			clause (5)a in Article 62 of the Draft Constitution and Schedule III-A thereto.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			42. Be that as it may, there appears to have been some discordance in the
			<lb />
			views and perception of different persons on the exact role of the President
			<lb />
			in the process of appointment of judges. Is the President expected to act on
			<lb />
			the advice of the Council of Ministers or in his/her personal capacity?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			43. One view, as expressed by Dr. Ambedkar was that the President would
			<lb />
			be guided by the Council of Ministers. The other view or perception was that
			<lb />
			with the insertion of clause (5)a in Article 62 of the Draft Constitution and
			<lb />
			Schedule III-A the President was to act in his/her individual capacity and not
			<lb />
			be guided by the Council of Ministers since the executive was to be kept
			<lb />
			completely out of the appointment process. It is not clear which of the two
			<lb />
			views found favour with Mr. B. Pocker Sahib and Mr. Mahboob Ali Baig
			<lb />
			Sahib -but both were clear that the President could be put under political or
			<lb />
			party pressure in the recommendation of a person for appointment and that
			<lb />
			this should be avoided and the pressure could be negated by the requirement
			<lb />
			of the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India, an impartial person.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			44. But what is more significant is that Mr. B. Pocker Sahib and Mr.
			<lb />
			Mahboob Ali Baig Sahib adverted only to a recommendation for the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge by the President -hence the necessity of concurrence
			<lb />
			by the Chief Justice of India. They did not, quite obviously, advert to the
			<lb />
			recommendation for the appointment of a judge by the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			45. It is in this background of divergence of perceptions that the speech of
			<lb />
			Dr. Ambedkar on 24 th May, 1949 should be appreciated. Replying to the
			<lb />
			debate, Dr. Ambedkar stated:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Now, Sir, with regard to the numerous amendments that have been
			<lb />
			moved, to this article, there are really three issues that have been raised.
			<lb />
			The first is, how are the Judges of the Supreme Court to be appointed?
			<lb />
			Now grouping the different amendments which are related to this
			<lb />
			particular matter, I find three different proposals. The first proposal is that
			<lb />
			the Judges of the Supreme Court should be appointed with the concurrence
			<lb />
			of the Chief Justice. That is one view. The other view is that the
			<lb />
			appointments made by the President should be subject to the confirmation
			<lb />
			of two-thirds vote by Parliament; and the third suggestion is that they
			<lb />
			should be appointed in consultation with the Council of States.
			<lb />
			With regard to this matter, I quite agree that the point raised is of the
			<lb />
			greatest importance. There can be no difference of opinion in the House
			<lb />
			that our judiciary must both be independent of the executive and must also
			<lb />
			be competent in itself. And the question is how these two objects could be
			<lb />
			secured. There are two in other countries. In Great Britain the
			<lb />
			appointments are made by the Crown, without any kind of limitation
			<lb />
			whatsoever, which means by the executive of the day. There is the opposite
			<lb />
			system in the United States where, for instance, officers of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court as well as other officers of the State shall be made [appointed] only
			<lb />
			with the concurrence of the Senate in the United States. It seems to me in
			<lb />
			the circumstances in which we live today, where the sense of responsibility
			<lb />
			has not grown to the same extent to which we find it in the United States, it
			<lb />
			would be dangerous to leave the appointments to be made by the President,
			<lb />
			without any kind of reservation or limitation, that is to say, merely on the
			<lb />
			advice of the executive of the day. Similarly, it seems to me that to make
			<lb />
			every appointment which the executive wishes to make subject to the
			<lb />
			concurrence of the Legislature is also not a very suitable provision. Apart
			<lb />
			from its being cumbrous, it also involves the possibility of the appointment
			<lb />
			being influenced by political pressure and political considerations. The
			<lb />
			draft article, therefore, steers a middle course. It does not make the
			<lb />
			President the supreme and the absolute authority in the matter of making
			<lb />
			appointments. It does not also import the influence of the Legislature. The
			<lb />
			provision in the article is that there should be consultation of persons who
			<lb />
			are ex hypothesi, well qualified to give proper advice in matters of this
			<lb />
			sort, and my judgment is that this sort of provision may be regarded as
			<lb />
			sufficient for the moment.
			<lb />
			With regard to the question of the concurrence of the Chief Justice, it
			<lb />
			seems to me that those who advocate that proposition seem to rely
			<lb />
			implicitly both on the impartiality of the Chief Justice and the soundness
			<lb />
			of his judgment. I personally feel no doubt that the Chief Justice is a very
			<lb />
			eminent person. But after all the Chief Justice is a man with all the
			<lb />
			failings, all the sentiments and all the prejudices which we as common
			<lb />
			people have; and I think, to allow the Chief Justice practically a veto upon
			<lb />
			the appointment of judges is really to transfer the authority to the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice which we are not prepared to vest in the President or the
			<lb />
			Government of the day. I, therefore, think that is also a dangerous
			<lb />
			proposition.&quot; 223
			<lb />
			46.
			<lb />
			Dr. Ambedkar was quite clear that there could be no difference of
			<lb />
			opinion that the judiciary should be independent of the executive, yet
			<lb />
			competent. He was of the view that it would be &apos;dangerous&apos; to leave the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges to the President without any reservation or limitation,
			<lb />
			that is to say, merely on the advice of the executive of the day. Dr. Ambedkar
			<lb />
			seems to have lost sight of the existence of the Instrument of Instructions (or
			<lb />
			it was &apos;given up&apos; by him) since that document mentioned the advice of the
			<lb />
			Advisory Board and not the executive and also that that document enabled
			<lb />
			the President to act on his/her own, and not on the advice of the executive.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			47. If this dichotomy between the role of the President and the executive
			<lb />
			and the binding or non-binding effect of the advice of the executive on the
			<lb />
			President is appreciated, the views of Dr. Ambedkar become very clear. He
			<lb />
			was quite clear that the executive was not to have primacy in the
			<lb />
			appointment process nor did he want the President to have unfettered
			<lb />
			discretion to accept or reject the advice of the executive or act on his/her
			<lb />
			own. As far as the concurrence of the Legislature is concerned, Dr.
			<lb />
			Ambedkar felt that the process would be cumbrous with the possibility of
			<lb />
			political pressure and considerations. It is in this context that Dr. Ambedkar
			<lb />
			said that he was steering a middle course and was not prepared to grant a
			<lb />
			veto to the President (rejecting the advice of the executive or acting on
			<lb />
			his/her own) in the appointment of judges, executive primacy having already
			<lb />
			been rejected by him. Under the circumstances, he felt that &apos;this sort of
			<lb />
			provision [consultation with the Chief Justice of India] may be regarded as
			<lb />
			sufficient for the moment.&apos;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			48. With regard to the &apos;concurrence&apos; of the Chief Justice of India (as
			<lb />
			against consultation with the Chief Justice of India) in the appointment of a
			<lb />
			judge of the Supreme Court, Dr. Ambedkar was of the opinion that the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice, despite his eminence, had all the failings, sentiments and prejudices
			<lb />
			of common people and to confer on him a power of veto, which is not vested
			<lb />
			in the President or the Government of the day (that is the executive), would
			<lb />
			be a &apos;dangerous proposition&apos;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			49. Dr. Ambedkar was of the view that neither the President nor the
			<lb />
			Government of the day (the executive) nor the Chief Justice of India should
			<lb />
			have the final word in the matter of the appointment of judges. Who then
			<lb />
			would have the final say in the event of a difference of opinion between the
			<lb />
			President or the Government of the day or the Chief Justice of India on the
			<lb />
			appointment of a particular person as a judge? Dr. Ambedkar did not directly
			<lb />
			address this question since he did not visualize a stalemate arising in this
			<lb />
			regard.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			50. A small diversion -apart from the reasons already mentioned for
			<lb />
			keeping the executive out of the decision-taking process in the appointment
			<lb />
			of judges, it would be of interest to know that, on a different topic altogether,
			<lb />
			while replying to the debate &apos;on acceptance of office by members of the
			<lb />
			judiciary after retirement&apos; Dr. Ambedkar observed that the judiciary is very
			<lb />
			rarely engaged in deciding issues between citizens and the Government. He
			<lb />
			said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The judiciary decides cases in which the Government has, if at all, the
			<lb />
			remotest interest, in fact no interest at all. The judiciary is engaged in
			<lb />
			deciding the issue between citizens and very rarely between citizens and
			<lb />
			the Government. Consequently the chances of influencing the conduct of a
			<lb />
			member of the judiciary by the Government are very remote, and my
			<lb />
			personal view, therefore, is that the provisions which are applied to the
			<lb />
			Federal Public Services Commission have no place so far as the judiciary
			<lb />
			is concerned.&quot; 224
			<lb />
			51. Times have changed dramatically since then and far from disputes
			<lb />
			&apos;very rarely&apos; arising between citizens and the Government, today the
			<lb />
			Government is unashamedly the biggest litigant in the country. It has been
			<lb />
			noticed in Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association v. Union of
			<lb />
			India 225 that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;No one can deny that the State in the present day has become the major
			<lb />
			litigant and the superior courts particularly the Supreme Court, have
			<lb />
			become centres for turbulent controversies, some of which with a flavour
			<lb />
			of political repercussions and the Courts have to face tempest and storm
			<lb />
			because their vitality is a national imperative. In such circumstances,
			<lb />
			therefore, can the Government, namely, the major litigant be justified in
			<lb />
			enjoying absolute authority in nominating and appointing its arbitrators.
			<lb />
			The answer would be in the negative. If such a process is allowed to
			<lb />
			continue, the independence of judiciary in the long run will sink without
			<lb />
			any trace.&quot; 226
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			52. Given this fact situation, since there was this reason in 1949 to
			<lb />
			insulate the judiciary and the appointment process from the direct or indirect
			<lb />
			influence of the executive and political or party pressures, there is all the
			<lb />
			more reason to do so today if the independence of the judiciary is to be
			<lb />
			maintained.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			53. In England too the executive is the &apos;most frequent litigator&apos; and the
			<lb />
			position seems to be no better than in our country. In a lecture on Judicial
			<lb />
			Independence, Lord Phillips 227 had this to say:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;In modern society the individual citizen is subject to controls imposed by
			<lb />
			the executive in respect of almost every aspect of life. The authority to
			<lb />
			impose most of those controls comes, directly or indirectly, from the
			<lb />
			legislature. The citizen must be able to challenge the legitimacy of
			<lb />
			executive action before an independent judiciary. Because it is the
			<lb />
			executive that exercises the power of the State and because it is the
			<lb />
			executive, in one form or another, that is the most frequent litigator in the
			<lb />
			courts, it is from executive pressure or influence that judges require
			<lb />
			particularly to be protected.&quot; 228
			<lb />
			Summation
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			54. The discussion leading up to the Constituent Assembly Debates and
			<lb />
			relating to the appointment of judges clearly brings out that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(1) The independence of the judiciary was unflinchingly accepted by
			<lb />
			all policy and decision makers;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(2) The appointment of judges of the Supreme Court and the High
			<lb />
			Courts was to be through a consultative process between the President and
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India, neither of whom had unfettered discretion in the
			<lb />
			matter;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(3) In any event, the political executive had no role or a very little role
			<lb />
			to play in the decision-taking process. Notwithstanding this, the political
			<lb />
			executive did interfere in the appointment process as evidenced by the
			<lb />
			Memorandum prepared in the Conference of Chief Justices by, inter alia,
			<lb />
			recommending persons for appointment as judges of the High Court.
			<lb />
			Resultantly, the appointment of judges to the High Courts was not always on
			<lb />
			merit and sometimes without the recommendation of the Chief Justice of the
			<lb />
			High Court;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(4) A constitutional convention existed that the appointment of judges
			<lb />
			should be made in conformity with the views of the Chief Justice of India;
			<lb />
			(5) The proposal for the appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			or a High Court could originate from the President (although it never did) or
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India and regardless of the origin, it would normally be
			<lb />
			accepted. However, the possibility of the President giving in to political or
			<lb />
			party pressures was not outside the realm of imagination.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(6) Historically, the Chief Justice of India was always consulted in the
			<lb />
			matter of appointment of judges, and conventionally his concurrence was
			<lb />
			always taken regardless of whether a recommendation for appointment
			<lb />
			originated from the Chief Justice of the High Court or the political executive.
			<lb />
			It is in this light that the discussion in the Constituent Assembly on the issue
			<lb />
			of appointment of judges to the Supreme Court and the High Courts deserves
			<lb />
			to be appreciated.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(7) It remained a grey area whether in the appointment of judges, the
			<lb />
			President was expected to act on his/her own or on the advice of the political
			<lb />
			executive.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Views of the Law Commission of India
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			55. The issue of the appointment of judges of the Supreme Court and the
			<lb />
			High Courts was first addressed, after Independence, in the 14 th Report of the
			<lb />
			Law Commission of India (for short the LCI), then in the 80 th Report and
			<lb />
			finally in the 121 st Report. (A reference was made in the 214 th Report and the
			<lb />
			230 th Report but they are of no immediate consequence). The issue also came
			<lb />
			to be addressed in S.P. Gupta v. Union of India 229 and in Subhash Sharma
			<lb />
			v. Union of India. 230 It was also the subject matter of three Constitution
			<lb />
			amendment Bills and two other pronouncements of this Court rendered by
			<lb />
			larger Benches. This is mentioned only to highlight the complexity of the
			<lb />
			issue and the constant search for some stability and certainty in the
			<lb />
			appointment process in relation to the independence of the judiciary. It has
			<lb />
			been said with regard to the selection of judges in the United States, and this
			<lb />
			would equally apply to our country:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It is fairly certain that no single subject has consumed as many pages in
			<lb />
			law reviews and law-related publications over the past 50 years as the
			<lb />
			subject of judicial selection.&quot; 231
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(a) 14 th Report -26.9.1958
			<lb />
			Appointment of judges of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			56. Within less than a decade of the promulgation of the Constitution, the
			<lb />
			process of appointment of judges of the Supreme Court and the High
			<lb />
			Courts came in for sharp criticism from the LCI. Chapter 5 and Chapter
			<lb />
			6 of the 14 th Report of the LCI relating, inter alia, to the appointment of
			<lb />
			judges to the Supreme Court and judges to the High Courts respectively
			<lb />
			makes for some sad reading, more particularly since the
			<lb />
			Attorney-General for India was the Chair of the LCI. 232 It must be noted
			<lb />
			here that the LCI travelled through the length and breadth of the
			<lb />
			country for about one year and examined as many as 473 witnesses
			<lb />
			from a cross-section of society before giving its Report. It also adopted
			<lb />
			a novel procedure of co-opting two members from the States that were
			<lb />
			visited so as to understand the local problems. The monumental and
			<lb />
			authoritative work can only be admired.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			57. The LCI observed that the Constitution endeavored to put judges of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court &apos;above executive control&apos;. It very specifically
			<lb />
			acknowledged the importance of safeguarding the independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary and observed that &apos;It is obvious that the selection of the Judges
			<lb />
			constituting a Court of such pivotal importance to the progress of the nation
			<lb />
			must be a responsibility to be exercised with great care.&apos; 233
			<lb />
			58. Thereafter three central issues were adverted to -(1) Communal and
			<lb />
			regional considerations had prevailed in making the selection of judges. (2)
			<lb />
			The general impression was that executive influence was exerted now and
			<lb />
			again from the highest quarters in respect of some appointments to the
			<lb />
			Bench. (3) The best talent among the judges of the High Courts did not find
			<lb />
			its way to the Supreme Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			59. The Report said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;It is widely felt that communal and regional considerations have prevailed
			<lb />
			in making the selection of the Judges. The idea seems to have gained
			<lb />
			ground that the component States of India should have, as it were,
			<lb />
			representation on the Court. Though we call ourselves a secular State,
			<lb />
			ideas of communal representation, which were viciously planted in our
			<lb />
			body politic by the British, have not entirely lost their influence. What
			<lb />
			perhaps is still more to be regretted is the general impression, that now and
			<lb />
			again executive influence exerted from the highest quarters has been
			<lb />
			responsible for some appointments to the Bench. It is undoubtedly true,
			<lb />
			that the best talent among the Judges of the High Courts has not always
			<lb />
			found its way to the Supreme Court. This has prevented the Court from
			<lb />
			being looked upon by the subordinate Courts and the public generally with
			<lb />
			that respect and indeed, reverence to which it by its status entitled.&quot; 234
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			60. On the basis of its findings, the LCI recommended, inter alia, that
			<lb />
			&apos;communal and regional considerations should play no part in the making of
			<lb />
			appointments to the Supreme Court.&apos; However, the LCI did not proffer any
			<lb />
			solution to the vexed issue of making more satisfactory appointments to the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Appointment of judges of the High Courts
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			61. Similarly, Chapter 6 of the Report concerning the appointment of
			<lb />
			judges to the High Courts makes for equally sad reading. The inadequacies
			<lb />
			in the appointments made were pointed out as: (1) The selections have been
			<lb />
			unsatisfactory and induced by executive influence. (2) There is no
			<lb />
			recognizable principle for making the appointments and considerations of
			<lb />
			political expediency or regional or communal sentiments have played a role.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(3) Merit has been ignored in making appointments.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			62. It was said that these inadequacies were well founded and there was
			<lb />
			acute public dissatisfaction with the appointments made:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;We have visited all the High Court centres and on all hands we have
			<lb />
			heard bitter and reviling criticism about the appointments made to High
			<lb />
			Court judiciary give in recent years. This criticism has been made by
			<lb />
			Supreme Court Judges, High Court Judges, Retired Judges, Public
			<lb />
			Prosecutors numerous representatives, associations of the Bar, principals
			<lb />
			and professors of Law Colleges and very responsible members of the legal
			<lb />
			profession all over the country. One of the State Governments had to
			<lb />
			admit that some of the selections did not seem to be good and that careful
			<lb />
			scrutiny was necessary. The almost universal chorus of comment is that
			<lb />
			the selections are unsatisfactory and that they have been induced by
			<lb />
			executive influence. It has been said that these selections appears to have
			<lb />
			proceeded on no recognizable principle and seem to have been made out of
			<lb />
			consideration of political expediency or regional or communal sentiments.
			<lb />
			Some of the members of the Bar appointed to the Bench did not occupy
			<lb />
			the front rank in the profession either in the matter of legal equipment or of
			<lb />
			the volume of their practice at the bar. A number of more capable and
			<lb />
			deserving persons appear to have been ignored for reasons that can stem
			<lb />
			only from political or communal or similar grounds. Equally forceful or
			<lb />
			even more unfavourable comments have been made in respect of persons
			<lb />
			selected form the services. We are convinced that the views expressed to
			<lb />
			us show a well founded and acute public dissatisfaction at these
			<lb />
			appointments.&quot; 235
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			63. On the procedure followed for the appointment of a judge of the High
			<lb />
			Court and the administrative working of Article 217 of the Constitution, the
			<lb />
			LCI had this to say:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The Chief Justice forwards his recommendation to the Chief Minister
			<lb />
			who in turn forwards this recommendation in consultation with the
			<lb />
			Governor to the Minister of Home Affairs in the Central Government. If,
			<lb />
			however, the Chief Minister does not agree with the recommendation of
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice, he makes his own recommendation. It appears that in
			<lb />
			such a case, the Chief Justice is given an opportunity for making his
			<lb />
			comments on the recommendation made by the Chief Minister. This
			<lb />
			practice is not, however, invariably followed so that, in some cases it
			<lb />
			happens that the recommendation made by the Chief Minister does not
			<lb />
			come to the knowledge of the Chief Justice. The rival recommendations
			<lb />
			are then forwarded to the Minister of Home Affairs who, in consultation
			<lb />
			with the Chief Justice of India, advises the President as to the selection to
			<lb />
			be made. The person recommended by the Chief Minister may be, and
			<lb />
			occasionally is, selected in preference to the person recommended by the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice.&quot; 236
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			64. The LCI recorded that no less a personage than the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India had this to say about executive interference in the appointment of
			<lb />
			judges to the High Courts (for reasons other than merit):
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The Chief Minister now has a hand direct or indirect in the matter of the
			<lb />
			appointment to the High Court Bench. The inevitable result has been that
			<lb />
			the High Court appointments are not always made on merit but on
			<lb />
			extraneous considerations of community, caste, political affiliations, and
			<lb />
			likes and dislikes have a free play. This necessarily encourages canvassing
			<lb />
			which, I am sorry to say, has become the order of the day. The Chief
			<lb />
			Minister holding a political office dependent on the goodwill of his party
			<lb />
			followers may well be induced to listen and give way to canvassing. The
			<lb />
			Chief Justice on the other hand does not hold his office on sufferance of
			<lb />
			any party and he knows the advocates and their merits and demerits and a
			<lb />
			recommendation by the Chief Justice is therefore more likely to be on
			<lb />
			merit alone that the one made by the Chief Minister who may know
			<lb />
			nothing about the comparative legal acumen of the advocates.&quot; 237
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			65. To conclude this aspect, the Report observes that extraneous factors
			<lb />
			have influenced the appointments and that there seems to be canvassing for
			<lb />
			appointment as a judge of the High Court:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;This indeed is a dismal picture and would seem to show that the
			<lb />
			atmosphere of communalism, regionalism and political patronage, have in
			<lb />
			a considerable measure influenced appointments to the High Court
			<lb />
			Judiciary.
			<lb />
			Apart from this very disquieting feature, the prevalence of canvassing for
			<lb />
			judgeships is also a distressing development. Formerly, a member of the
			<lb />
			Bar was invited to accept a judgeship and he considered it a great privilege
			<lb />
			and honour. Within a few years of Independence, however, the judgeship of
			<lb />
			a High Court seems to have become a post to be worked and canvassed
			<lb />
			for.&quot; 238
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			66. Based on its findings, the LCI reached the following conclusions,
			<lb />
			amongst others:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;(8) Many unsatisfactory appointments have been made to the High Courts
			<lb />
			on political regional and communal or other grounds with the result that
			<lb />
			the fittest men have not been appointed. This has resulted in a diminution
			<lb />
			in the out-turn of work of the Judges.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(9) These unsatisfactory appointments have been made notwithstanding the
			<lb />
			fact that in the vast majority of cases, appointments have been concurred in
			<lb />
			by the Chief Justice of the High Court and the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(10) Consultation with the State executive is necessary before
			<lb />
			appointments are made to the High Court.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(11) While it should be open to the State executive to express its own
			<lb />
			opinion on a name proposed by the Chief Justice, it should not be open to it
			<lb />
			to propose a nominee of its own and forward it to the Centre.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(12) The role of the State executive should be confined to making its
			<lb />
			remarks about the nominee proposed by the Chief Justice and if necessary
			<lb />
			asking the Chief Justice to make a fresh recommendation.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(14) Article 217 of the Constitution should be amended to provide that a
			<lb />
			Judge of a High Court should be appointed only on the recommendation of
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of that State and with the concurrence of the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India.&quot; 239
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			67. Unlike in the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court, the LCI
			<lb />
			suggested, for the High Courts, that Article 217 of the Constitution ought to
			<lb />
			be amended to incorporate the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India to
			<lb />
			the appointment. This recommendation was made so that, in future, no
			<lb />
			appointment could be made without the concurrence of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			68. The Report was considered in Parliament on 23 rd , 24 th and 25 th
			<lb />
			November, 1959 and the Government of the day gave its point of view, as
			<lb />
			did several Hon&apos;ble Members. But what is more important is that in the
			<lb />
			debate on 24 th November, 1959 it was stated by Shri Govind Ballabh Pant,
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Minister of Home Affairs that since 1950, as many as 211 judges
			<lb />
			were appointed to the High Courts and out of these except one &apos;were made
			<lb />
			on the advice, with the consent and concurrence of the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
			And out of the 211, 196 proposals which were accepted by the Government
			<lb />
			had the support of all persons who were connected with this matter.&apos; 240
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			69. A little later it was stated:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;But as I said, these 196 appointments were made in accordance with the
			<lb />
			unanimous advice of the Chief Justice of the High Court, the Chief
			<lb />
			Minister of the State, the Governor and the Chief Justice of India. There
			<lb />
			were fifteen cases in which there was a difference of opinion between the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice and the Chief Minister or the Governor. So, these cases also
			<lb />
			were referred to the Chief Justice of India. In some of these he accepted
			<lb />
			the proposal made by the Chief Minister and in others he accepted the
			<lb />
			advice or the suggestion received from the Chief Justice of the High Court.
			<lb />
			But we on our part had his advice along with that of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			the High Court concerned and of the Chief Minister concerned. So, these
			<lb />
			cases do not even come to five per cent. But even there, so far as we are
			<lb />
			concerned, out of these 211 cases, as I said, except in one case where there
			<lb />
			was a difference of opinion between the Chief Minister and the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice, we had accepted in 210 cases the advice of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India.&quot; 241
			<lb />
			70. On the next day, that is, 25 th November, 1959 Shri A.K. Sen, Minister
			<lb />
			of Law reiterated the statement made by the Home Minister. He clarified
			<lb />
			that in one case where there was a difference of opinion, the Government
			<lb />
			accepted the advice of the Chief Justice of the High Court (not the Chief
			<lb />
			Minister) rather than the advice of the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			71. The discussion ended with an Hon&apos;ble Member suggesting that the
			<lb />
			recommendations of the LCI be taken note of and implemented as quickly as
			<lb />
			possible.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			72. What is of importance in this Report (apart from several other
			<lb />
			conclusions) is that there had been instances where a recommendation for
			<lb />
			appointment as a judge of the High Court was made by the Chief Minister
			<lb />
			without the knowledge of the Chief Justice and that canvassing had begun to
			<lb />
			take place for appointment as a judge of the High Court. But in all cases,
			<lb />
			except one, the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India was taken.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) 80 th Report -10.8.1979
			<lb />
			Appointment of judges of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			73. The 80 th Report of the LCI was submitted on 10 th August, 1979 and it
			<lb />
			was mainly prepared by Justice H.R. Khanna when he was its Chair. 242
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			74. It was observed that an independent judiciary is absolutely
			<lb />
			indispensible for ensuring the Rule of Law. Generally in regard to
			<lb />
			appointment of judges, it was observed that wrong appointments have
			<lb />
			affected the image of the Courts and have undermined the confidence of the
			<lb />
			people in them. Further, it was observed that an appointment not made on
			<lb />
			merit but because of favouritism or other ulterior considerations can hardly
			<lb />
			command real and spontaneous respect of the Bar and that the effect of an
			<lb />
			improper appointment is felt not only for the time being but its repercussions
			<lb />
			are felt long thereafter. 243
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			75. In this background, and in relation to the appointment of judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court, it was concluded that (1) Only persons who enjoy the
			<lb />
			highest reputation for independence, dispassionate approach and detachment
			<lb />
			should be elevated to the Supreme Court. (2) No one should be appointed a
			<lb />
			judge of the Supreme Court unless he has severed affiliations with political
			<lb />
			parties for at least 7 (seven) years. (3) A person should be appointed as a
			<lb />
			judge if he has distinguished himself for his independence, dispassionate
			<lb />
			approach and freedom from political prejudice, bias or leaning. 244
			<lb />
			76. Significantly, the LCI recommended adopting a consultative process
			<lb />
			in that the Chief Justice of India should consult his three senior-most
			<lb />
			colleagues while making a recommendation for an appointment. He should
			<lb />
			reproduce their views while making the recommendation. This would
			<lb />
			minimize the chances of any possible arbitrariness or favouritism. 245
			<lb />
			77. These recommendations were incorporated by the LCI in its summary
			<lb />
			of recommendations. I am concerned with the following recommendation:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;(32) The Chief Justice of India, while recommending the name of a
			<lb />
			person for appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court should consult his
			<lb />
			three senior most colleagues and should in the communication
			<lb />
			incorporating his recommendation specify the result of such consultation
			<lb />
			and reproduce the views of each of his colleagues so consulted regarding
			<lb />
			his recommendation. The role of these colleagues would be confined to
			<lb />
			commenting on the recommendation of the Chief Justice.
			<lb />
			Such
			<lb />
			consultation would minimize possible arbitrariness or favoritism&quot; 246
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Appointment of judges of the High Court
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			78. In relation to the appointment of judges of the High Court, it was
			<lb />
			generally observed by the LCI in Chapter 6 of the Report that the
			<lb />
			prevailing impression was that their appointment &apos;has not been always
			<lb />
			made on merit and that this has affected the image of the High Courts.&apos;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			247
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			79. The LCI suggested a consultation process for the appointment of a
			<lb />
			judge of the High Court. It was suggested that the Chief Justice should, when
			<lb />
			making a recommendation, consult his two senior-most colleagues and
			<lb />
			indicate their views in writing. This would have a &apos;healthy effect&apos; and
			<lb />
			considerably minimize the chances of possible favoritism. It was opined that
			<lb />
			any recommendation of the Chief Justice which is concurred with by the two
			<lb />
			senior-most judges should normally be accepted. The LCI was, in principle,
			<lb />
			against the selection of persons as judges of the High Court on grounds or
			<lb />
			considerations of religion, caste or region.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			80. With regard to the recommendations originating from the political
			<lb />
			executive it was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Another question which has engaged attention is as to whether the role of
			<lb />
			the Chief Minister should be that of commenting on the name
			<lb />
			recommended by the Chief Justice, or whether, in case he disagrees with
			<lb />
			the recommendation of the Chief Justice, he (the Chief Minister) can also
			<lb />
			suggest another name. This question was agitated in the past, and after due
			<lb />
			consideration it was decided that the Chief Minister would be entitled, in
			<lb />
			case he disagrees with the recommendation of the Chief Justice to suggest
			<lb />
			another name. The Chief Minister in such an event has to invite the
			<lb />
			comments of the Chief Justice and send the matter thereafter along with
			<lb />
			the comments of the Chief Justice, to the Union Minister of Law and
			<lb />
			Justice. In view of the fact that a decision referred to above has already
			<lb />
			been taken after due consideration, we need not say anything further in the
			<lb />
			matter.&quot; 248
			<lb />
			81. Keeping all these factors in mind, some of the recommendations made
			<lb />
			by the LCI were as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;(3) When making a recommendation for appointment of a judge of a High
			<lb />
			Court, the Chief Justice should consult his two seniormost colleagues. The
			<lb />
			Chief Justice, in his letter recommending the appointment, should state the
			<lb />
			fact of such consultation and indicate the views of his two colleagues so
			<lb />
			consulted.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(4) Any recommendation of the Chief Justice which carries the
			<lb />
			concurrence of his two seniormost colleagues should normally be
			<lb />
			accepted.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(7) The Commission is, in principle, against selection to the High Court
			<lb />
			Bench on ground of religion, caste or region. Merit should be the only
			<lb />
			consideration. Even when matters of State policy make it necessary to
			<lb />
			give representation to persons belonging to some religion, caste or region,
			<lb />
			every effort should be made to select the best person. The number of such
			<lb />
			appointments should be as few as possible.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(12) On the question whether the role of the Chief Minister should be that
			<lb />
			only of commenting on the name recommended by the Chief Justice, or
			<lb />
			whether the Chief Minister can also suggest another name, a decision has
			<lb />
			already been taken and nothing further need be said in the matter.&quot; 249
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			82. Generally speaking, the LCI was of the view that the constitutional
			<lb />
			scheme of appointment of judges was basically sound, had worked
			<lb />
			satisfactorily and did not call for any radical change, though some aspects
			<lb />
			needed improvement. The recommendations mentioned above were made in
			<lb />
			that light.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(c) 121 st Report -31.7.1987
			<lb />
			A new forum for judicial appointments
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			83. It is important to note that this Report was prepared after the decision
			<lb />
			of this Court in S.P. Gupta. In its 121 st Report, the LCI noted that over the
			<lb />
			last four decades, mounting dissatisfaction has been voiced over the method
			<lb />
			and strategy of selection and the selectees to man the superior judiciary. 250
			<lb />
			Further, in paragraph 7.1 of its Report, the LCI noted that &apos;Everyone is
			<lb />
			agreed that the present scheme or model or mechanism for recruitment to
			<lb />
			superior judiciary has failed to deliver the goods.&apos; This was with reference to
			<lb />
			the executive primacy theory in the appointment of judges propounded in
			<lb />
			S.P. Gupta. In view of this the LCI recommended a new broad-based model
			<lb />
			called a National Judicial Service Commission. 251
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			84. The LCI observed that two models were available for the appointment
			<lb />
			of judges. The first was the existing model which conferred overriding
			<lb />
			powers on the executive in selecting and appointing judges. But, Article 50
			<lb />
			of the Constitution mandates a separation between the Executive and the
			<lb />
			Judiciary. The second model involved diluting (not excluding) the authority
			<lb />
			of the executive by associating more people in the decision making process
			<lb />
			and setting up a body in which the judiciary has a pre-eminent position. This
			<lb />
			participatory model was called by the LCI as the National Judicial Service
			<lb />
			Commission.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			85. The Commission was envisaged as a multi-member body headed by
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India whose &apos;pre-eminent position should not be diluted
			<lb />
			at all&apos;, his predecessor in office, three senior-most judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court, three Chief Justices of the High Courts in order of their seniority, the
			<lb />
			Law Minister, the Attorney-General for India and an outstanding law
			<lb />
			academic. Thus, an 11 (eleven) member body was proposed by the LCI for
			<lb />
			the selection and appointment of judges of the Supreme Court and the High
			<lb />
			Courts. To give effect to the recommendation, it was proposed to suitably
			<lb />
			amend the Constitution. 252
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			86. The recommendation of the LCI was partially accepted by the
			<lb />
			government of the day and the Constitution (Sixty-seventh Amendment) Bill,
			<lb />
			1990 was introduced in Parliament. This will be adverted to a little later.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Arrears Committee -1989-90
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			87. Between 11 th and 13 th December, 1987 a Conference of Chief Justices
			<lb />
			was held with the Chief Justice of India in the Chair. The Conference
			<lb />
			discussed, inter alia, issues relating to arrears of cases in the High Courts and
			<lb />
			the District Courts in the country. Grave concern was expressed over the
			<lb />
			problem of arrears and it was pointed out by most Chief Justices that delay in
			<lb />
			the appointment of judges is responsible for the arrears. Even after
			<lb />
			recommendations are sent, the Chief Justice has to wait for a long time for
			<lb />
			the Government to make the appointment with the result that for a number of
			<lb />
			years Courts have been working with about 50% of their strength.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			88. After a detailed discussion of the matter, it was decided to appoint a
			<lb />
			committee of Chief Justices to thoroughly examine the issues raised and a
			<lb />
			Resolution was passed appointing such a committee. The composition of the
			<lb />
			committee called the Arrears Committee changed over a period of time but
			<lb />
			finally it consisted of Chief Justice V.S. Malimath (Kerala High Court),
			<lb />
			Chief Justice P.D. Desai (Calcutta High Court) and Chief Justice Dr. A.S.
			<lb />
			Anand (Madras High Court). The Arrears Committee gave its Report in two
			<lb />
			volumes to the Conference of Chief Justices held between 31 st August and 2 nd
			<lb />
			September, 1990 which accepted the Reports, subject to a few modifications.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			89. Chapter 5 of Volume 2 of the Report deals with the unsatisfactory
			<lb />
			appointment of judges to the High Courts. It was observed by the Arrears
			<lb />
			Committee that unsatisfactory appointments have contributed in a large
			<lb />
			measure to the accumulation of arrears in the High Courts. It was observed
			<lb />
			that merit and merit alone, coupled with a reputation for integrity, suitability
			<lb />
			and capability has to be the criterion for selection of judges and judges not
			<lb />
			selected on that basis or who are appointed on considerations other than
			<lb />
			merit, may not be able to act impartially and fairly. It was noted that for this
			<lb />
			reason the selection of judges should be made with utmost care and
			<lb />
			concern. 253
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			90. The Arrears Committee also considered the Report given in the recent
			<lb />
			past by the Satish Chandra Committee which was of the confirmed view that
			<lb />
			some judges have not been directly recommended by the Chief Justice of the
			<lb />
			High Court but have been foisted on the High Court and that if this trend
			<lb />
			continued, it would be very difficult for the Chief Justice to effectively
			<lb />
			transact the judicial business of the Court. 254
			<lb />
			91. Thereafter, the selection of a judge of the High Court for reasons other
			<lb />
			than merit was discussed and it was observed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The selection of a person, on considerations other than merit, has far
			<lb />
			reaching consequences and does more damage than what apparently meets
			<lb />
			the eye. Such an appointee does not even receive from the members of the
			<lb />
			Bar the measure of respect and co-operation which is imperative for proper
			<lb />
			administration of justice. He may not have confidence even in himself and
			<lb />
			a command over the proceedings of the Court. All this would be at the
			<lb />
			cost of proper administration of justice. The effect would be felt not only
			<lb />
			on the quality but also on the quantity of the work turned out.
			<lb />
			According to Satish Chandra Committee, the sea change which has
			<lb />
			gradually come into the political process is directly responsible for the
			<lb />
			grave deterioration and the fall in the high standards of appointments to the
			<lb />
			High Court Bench previously maintained. Barring exceptions, the Chief
			<lb />
			Ministers to-day have come to think that even filling up vacancies on the
			<lb />
			High Court Bench is a matter of patronage, political or otherwise. It
			<lb />
			noticed that formerly members of the Bar were invited to accept
			<lb />
			judge-ship. Now, the judge-ship of the High Court seems to have become a
			<lb />
			post to be canvassed for. It was found that as long as the State executive
			<lb />
			has an effective hand in such appointments, this disquieting feature would
			<lb />
			continue and that it could be remedied only by providing the safeguard of
			<lb />
			the executive having no final say in the matter of appointment and that the
			<lb />
			last word in the matter should be of the Chief Justice of the High Court
			<lb />
			concerned and the Chief Justice of India. The Committee, therefore,
			<lb />
			suggested amendment of the Constitution, as a guarantee for ensuring the
			<lb />
			quality, that an appointment to the High Court must have the concurrence
			<lb />
			of the Chief Justice of India and should not be made merely in consultation
			<lb />
			with him. An amendment was suggested to Article 217(1) of the
			<lb />
			Constitution on those lines.&quot; 255
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			92. It was concluded that for the judicial system to function effectively
			<lb />
			and for the people to have faith and confidence in it, the appointment of
			<lb />
			judges should be made only on considerations of merit, suitability, integrity
			<lb />
			and capability and not on political expediency or regional or communal
			<lb />
			sentiments. It was observed in this regard as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;This Committee is of the firm view that to ensure that the judicial system
			<lb />
			functions effectively and to maintain both the quality and quantity of
			<lb />
			judicial work, as well as the faith and confidence of the public, the
			<lb />
			appointments be made only on considerations of merit, suitability, integrity
			<lb />
			and capability and not of political expediency or regional or communal
			<lb />
			sentiments. The apprehension that the recommendation made by him may
			<lb />
			not meet with the approval of the executive, may sometimes induce a
			<lb />
			Chief Justice to propose the name of a person who does not measure upto
			<lb />
			the requisite standard, which is rather unfortunate. It is fundamental for
			<lb />
			the preservation of the independence of the judiciary that it be free from
			<lb />
			threats and pressures from any quarter. It is the duty of the State to ensure
			<lb />
			that the judiciary occupies, and is seen to occupy, such position in the
			<lb />
			polity that it can effectively perform the functions entrusted to it by the
			<lb />
			Constitution and that can be done only if the process of appointment is left
			<lb />
			unpolluted.&quot; 256
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			93. Commenting on the existing system of appointment of judges, the
			<lb />
			Arrears Committee reviewed the system in Chapter 6 of the Report. Amongst
			<lb />
			other things it was observed that the system of appointment of judges had
			<lb />
			been prevailing for four decades and it was functioning satisfactorily so long
			<lb />
			as well-established conventions were honoured and followed and that it is
			<lb />
			not the system that has failed but those operating it had failed it by allowing
			<lb />
			it to be perverted. It was observed as follows:
			<lb />

			&quot;The present system of appointment of Judges to the High Courts has been
			<lb />
			in vogue for about four decades. It functioned satisfactorily as long as the
			<lb />
			well-established conventions were honoured and followed. The gradual,
			<lb />
			but systematic violation and virtual annihilation of the conventions over
			<lb />
			the past two decades or so is essentially responsible for the present
			<lb />
			unfortunate situation. Has the system, therefore, failed or have the
			<lb />
			concerned failed the system is an all important question. It is apparent that
			<lb />
			the system has not failed, but all those concerned with operating the
			<lb />
			system have failed it by allowing it to be perverted.&quot; 257

			94. While dealing with the Memorandum of Procedure in existence at that
			<lb />
			time for the appointment of judges, the Arrears Committee was rather
			<lb />
			scathing in its observations to the effect that there had been cases where
			<lb />
			there was agreement between the Chief Justice of India, the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			the concerned High Court and the Governor of the State but the Union Law
			<lb />
			Minister either choose not to make the appointment or inordinately delayed
			<lb />
			the appointment. It was observed that sometimes the Union Law Minister
			<lb />
			adopted a pick and choose policy to appoint judges or disturb the order in
			<lb />
			which the recommendations were made.
			<lb />
			There had been political
			<lb />
			interference in this regard and undesirable influence of extra-constitutional
			<lb />
			authorities in the appointment of judges. The appointment process therefore
			<lb />
			was undermined leaving the executive to appoint judges not on excellence
			<lb />
			but on influence. It was observed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;There are cases that even where the Chief Justice of India on being
			<lb />
			consulted, agrees with the recommendation made by the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			the concerned High Court which is also concurred to by the Governor of
			<lb />
			the State and forwards his recommendation to the Union Law Minister,
			<lb />
			appointments are either not made or made after inordinate delay.
			<lb />
			Sometimes, the Union Law Minister even adopts the &quot;pick and choose&quot;
			<lb />
			policy to appoint Judges out of the list of selectees recommended by the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of the High Court duly concurred in by the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India or makes appointments by disturbing the order in which the
			<lb />
			recommendations have been made. The malady has become more acute in
			<lb />
			view of the political interference and undesirable influence of &quot;extra
			<lb />
			constitutional authorities&quot; in the appointment of judges. Thus, the
			<lb />
			authority of the Chief Justice of India and the role of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			the High Courts in the matter of appointment of superior judiciary have, to
			<lb />
			a great extent, been undermined, leaving to the executive to appoint Judges
			<lb />
			not on &quot;excellence&quot; but on &quot;influence&quot;. Thus, merit, ability and suitability
			<lb />
			which undoubtedly the Chief Justice of the High Court is the most proper
			<lb />
			person to judge, are sacrificed at the altar of political or other expediency.
			<lb />
			This attitude is essentially responsible for the deterioration and the fall in
			<lb />
			the high standards of appointments to the High Court Benches. It is
			<lb />
			unfortunate, but absolutely true, that the Chief Ministers have come to
			<lb />
			think and the Union Law Minister has come to believe that the vacancy in
			<lb />
			the High Court Bench is a matter of political patronage which they are
			<lb />
			entitled to distribute or dole out to their favourites. This veto power with
			<lb />
			the executive has played havoc in the matter of appointment of Judges.&quot; 258
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			95. In its recommendations, the Arrears Committee recommended dilution
			<lb />
			of the role of the executive and measures to avoid the existing system of
			<lb />
			appointment from being perverted. It was recommended as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The role of the executive in the matter of appointment of judges should be
			<lb />
			diluted and that the cause for most of the ills in the functioning of the
			<lb />
			present system could be traced back to the veto power of the executive.
			<lb />
			This, indeed, is capable of being remedied by making certain amendments
			<lb />
			to Article 217 providing for concurrence of the Chief Justice of India,
			<lb />
			instead of consultation with him, in the matter of appointment of Judges of
			<lb />
			the High Courts.&quot; 259
			<lb />
			&quot;The Committee is of the view that the present constitutional scheme
			<lb />
			which was framed by the founding fathers after great deliberation and
			<lb />
			much reflection is intrinsically sound and that it worked in the true spirit it
			<lb />
			does not require any radical change. In order to guard against and obviate
			<lb />
			the perversion revealed in the operation of the scheme, the Committee has
			<lb />
			made suitable recommendations. The Committee believes that if these
			<lb />
			recommendations are given effect to, there would not be any need to
			<lb />
			substitute it by a different mechanism.&quot; 260
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			96. In view of the scathing indictment of the system of appointment of
			<lb />
			judges where the executive had the &apos;ultimate power&apos; 261 which was being
			<lb />
			abused and perverted to take away the independence of the judiciary,
			<lb />
			contrary to the intention of the Constituent Assembly, there was no option
			<lb />
			but to have a fresh look into the entire issue of appointment of judges and
			<lb />
			that eventually led to the issue being referred in the early 1990&apos;s to a Bench
			<lb />
			of 9 (nine) judges of this Court. Quite clearly, the executive had made a mess
			<lb />
			of the appointment of judges, taken steps to subvert the independence of the
			<lb />
			258 Paragraph 6.9
			<lb />
			259 Paragraph 124
			<lb />
			260 Paragraph 130
			<lb />
			261 This expression was used by Justice Bhagwati and by Justice D.A. Desai in paragraph 719 of S.P. Gupta
			<lb />
			v. Union of India.
			<lb />
			judiciary, gone against the grain of the views of the Constituent Assembly
			<lb />
			and acted in a manner that a responsible executive ought not to.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			97. Post Independence till the early 1990s, the judiciary saw the slow but
			<lb />
			sure interference of the executive in the appointment of judges. This was in
			<lb />
			the form of the executive recommending persons to the Chief Justice of the
			<lb />
			High Court for appointment as a judge of the High Court. There were
			<lb />
			occasions when the executive completely by-passed the Chief Justice of the
			<lb />
			High Court and directly recommended persons to the Union Government for
			<lb />
			appointment as judges. The third stratagem adopted by the executive was to
			<lb />
			withhold recommendations made by the Chief Justice and instead forward its
			<lb />
			own recommendation to the Union Government. The fourth method was to
			<lb />
			reopen approved recommendations on some pretext or the other. The fifth
			<lb />
			method was to delay processing a recommendation made by the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			98. Tragically, almost all the appointments made during this period had
			<lb />
			the concurrence (as a constitutional convention) of the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			and yet, there was criticism of some of the appointments made. While the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary was maintained at law, it was being slowly
			<lb />
			eroded both from within and without through the appointment of &apos;unsuitable&apos;
			<lb />
			judges with merit occasionally taking a side seat. The 14 th Report of the LCI
			<lb />
			was generally critical of the appointments made to the High Courts and in
			<lb />
			this regard reliance was placed by the LCI on information collected from
			<lb />
			various sources including judges of the Supreme Court. It is true that the 80 th
			<lb />
			Report of the LCI found nothing seriously wrong with the system of
			<lb />
			appointment of judges, but it still needed a change. The Arrears Committee,
			<lb />
			however, was derisive of the existing system of appointment of judges and
			<lb />
			made some positive recommendations within the existing system, while the
			<lb />
			121 st Report of the LCI suggested wholesale changes.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			99. This discussion in the historical perspective indicates that the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges plays a crucial and critical role in the independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary in the real sense of the term. If judges can be influenced by
			<lb />
			political considerations and other extraneous factors, the judiciary cannot
			<lb />
			remain independent only by securing the salary, allowances, conditions of
			<lb />
			service and pension of such judges. The meat lies in the caliber of the judges
			<lb />
			and not their perks.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			100. In his concluding address to the Constituent Assembly on 26 th
			<lb />
			November, 1949 Dr. Rajendra Prasad referred to the independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary and had this to say:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;We have provided in the Constitution for a judiciary which will be
			<lb />
			independent. It is difficult to suggest anything more to make the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court and the High Courts independent of the influence of the executive.
			<lb />
			There is an attempt made in the Constitution to make even the lower
			<lb />
			judiciary independent of any outside or extraneous influence. One of our
			<lb />
			articles makes it easy for the State Governments to introduce separation of
			<lb />
			executive from judicial functions and placing the magistracy which deals
			<lb />
			with criminal cases on similar footing as civil courts. I can only express
			<lb />
			the hope that this long overdue reform will soon be introduced in the
			<lb />
			States.&quot; 262
			<lb />
			101. Providing for an independent judiciary is not enough -access to
			<lb />
			quality justice achieved through the appointment of independent judges is
			<lb />
			equally important. It has been said of the judges during apartheid in South
			<lb />
			Africa:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;Now during apartheid judges had the formal guarantees of independence -
			<lb />
			life tenure, salary, administrative autonomy -that judges in the United
			<lb />
			States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand or Australia
			<lb />
			had. It is in seeing why it was the case that apartheid-era judges for the
			<lb />
			most part lacked independence even though they had its formal trappings
			<lb />
			that we see that judicial independence is also a kind of dependence; it
			<lb />
			depends on something positive -the judicial pursuit of the justice of the
			<lb />
			law. One has to ask not only what judges have to be shielded from in order
			<lb />
			to be independent, but what we want them to be independent for.&quot; 263
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			102. This review indicates that one of the important features of the Rule of
			<lb />
			Law and the independence of the judiciary is the appointment process. It is,
			<lb />
			therefore, necessary to objectively appreciate the evolution of the
			<lb />
			appointment process post Independence and how the Judiciary understood it.

			Judicial pronouncements
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			103. The question of the appointment of judges (mainly of the High Courts)
			<lb />
			came up for consideration in this Court on three occasions. The decision
			<lb />
			rendered in each of these cases is not only of considerable importance but
			<lb />
			also indicates the complexity in the appointment of judges and the struggle
			<lb />
			by the Bar to maintain the independence of the judiciary from executive
			<lb />
			interference and encroachment. These three cases are referred to as the First
			<lb />
			Judges case, 264 the Second Judges case 265 and the Third Judges case. 266
			<lb />
			There have been other significant pronouncements on the subject and they
			<lb />
			will be considered at the appropriate stage.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			First judges case -30.12.1981
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			104. The First Judges case is important for several reasons, but I am
			<lb />
			concerned with a few of them. These are: (1) The independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary was held to be a part of the basic feature of the Constitution. 267 This
			<lb />
			was the first judgment to so hold.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(2) The appointment of a judge is serious business and is recognized
			<lb />
			as a very vital component of the independence of the judiciary. &apos;What is
			<lb />
			necessary is to have Judges who are prepared to fashion new tools, forge
			<lb />
			new methods, innovate new strategies and evolve a new jurisprudence, who
			<lb />
			are judicial statesmen with a social vision and a creative faculty and who
			<lb />
			have, above all, a deep sense of commitment to the Constitution with an
			<lb />
			activist approach and obligation for accountability, not to any party in power
			<lb />
			nor to the opposition nor to the classes which are vociferous but to the
			<lb />
			half-hungry millions of India who are continually denied their basic human
			<lb />
			rights. We need Judges who are alive to the socio-economic realities of
			<lb />
			Indian life, who are anxious to wipe every tear from every eye, who have
			<lb />
			faith in the constitutional values and who are ready to use law as an
			<lb />
			264 S.P. Gupta v. Union of India, 1981 Supp SCC 87 (Seven Judges Bench)
			<lb />
			265 Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of India, (1993) 4 SCC 441 (Nine Judges
			<lb />
			Bench)
			<lb />
			266 Special Reference No. 1 of 1998, (1998) 7 SCC 739 (Nine Judges Bench)

			267 Paragraphs 27, 320 and 634. This view has been upheld in several decisions thereafter.
			<lb />
			Page 635
			<lb />
			instrument for achieving the constitutional objectives. This has to be the
			<lb />
			broad blueprint of the appointment project for the higher echelons of judicial
			<lb />
			service. It is only if appointments of Judges are made with these
			<lb />
			considerations weighing predominantly with the appointing authority that we
			<lb />
			can have a truly independent judiciary committed only to the Constitution
			<lb />
			and to the people of India.&apos; 268 Justice Venkataramiah, however, was of the
			<lb />
			view that the independence of the judiciary is relatable only to
			<lb />
			post-appointment and that &apos;It is difficult to hold that merely because the
			<lb />
			power of appointment is with the executive, the independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary would become impaired. The true principle is that after such
			<lb />
			appointment the executive should have no scope to interfere with the work of
			<lb />
			a Judge.&apos; 269
			<lb />
			(3) In the appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court or the High
			<lb />
			Court, the word &apos;consultation&apos; occurring in Article 124(2) and in Article
			<lb />
			217(1) of the Constitution does not mean &apos;concurrence&apos;. 270 However, for the
			<lb />
			purposes of consultation, each constitutional functionary must have full and
			<lb />
			identical facts relating to the appointment of a judge and the consultation
			<lb />
			should be based on this identical material. 271
			<lb />
			(4) In the event of a disagreement between the constitutional
			<lb />
			functionaries required to be consulted in the appointment of a judge, the
			<lb />
			Union Government would decide whose opinion should be accepted and
			<lb />
			whether an appointment should be made or not. In such an event, the opinion
			<lb />
			of the Chief Justice of India has no primacy. 272 The &apos;ultimate power&apos; of
			<lb />
			appointment of judges to the superior Courts rests with the Union
			<lb />
			Government. 273 (This is completely contrary to the view of the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly and Dr. Ambedkar).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(5) The extant system of appointment of judges is not an ideal system
			<lb />
			of appointment. The idea of a consultative panel (called a collegium or
			<lb />
			Judicial Commission) was floated as a replacement. This body was to consist
			<lb />
			of persons expected to have knowledge of persons who might be fit for
			<lb />
			appointment on the Bench and possessed of qualities required for such an
			<lb />
			appointment. Countries like Australia and New Zealand &apos;have veered round
			<lb />
			to the view that there should be a Judicial Commission for appointment of
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary.&apos; 274 Incidentally, we were informed during the course of
			<lb />
			hearing that even about 35 years after the decision in the First Judges case
			<lb />
			neither Australia nor New Zealand have established a Judicial Commission
			<lb />
			as yet.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			105. On the meaning of &apos;consultation&apos; for the purposes of Article 124(2)
			<lb />
			and Article 217(1) of the Constitution, Justice Bhagwati who spoke for the
			<lb />
			majority relied upon Union of India v. Sankalchand Himmatlal Sheth 275
			<lb />
			and R. Pushpam v. State of Madras 276 to hold that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Each of the constitutional functionaries required to be consulted under
			<lb />
			these two articles must have for his consideration full and identical facts
			<lb />
			bearing upon appointment or non-appointment of the person concerned as
			<lb />
			a Judge and the opinion of each of them taken on identical material must
			<lb />
			be considered by the Central Government before it takes a decision
			<lb />
			whether or not to appoint the person concerned as a Judge.&quot; 277
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			106. The majority view in the First Judges case was overruled in the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case and it was held that &apos;consultation&apos; in Article 217 and
			<lb />
			Article 124 of the Constitution meant that &apos;primacy&apos; in the appointment of
			<lb />
			judges must rest with the Chief Justice of India. 278 The evolution of the
			<lb />
			collegium system and a Judicial Commission will be discussed a little later,
			<lb />
			although it must be noted that the seeds thereof were sown (apart from the
			<lb />
			Reports of the LCI) in the First Judges case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			107. I do not think it necessary to further discuss the First Judges case
			<lb />
			since it has been elaborately considered by Justice Khehar.
			<lb />
			Subhash Sharma&apos;s case
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			108. In a writ petition filed in this Court praying for filling up the vacancies
			<lb />
			of judges in the Supreme Court and several High Courts of the country, a
			<lb />
			three judge Bench was of the view that the First Judges case required
			<lb />
			reconsideration. 279 It was observed that the decision of the majority not only
			<lb />
			rejects the primacy of the Chief Justice of India but also whittles down the
			<lb />
			significance of &apos;consultation&apos;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			109. It was noted that the Constitution (Sixty-seventh Amendment) Bill,
			<lb />
			1990 was pending consideration in Parliament and that the Statement of
			<lb />
			Objects and Reasons for the Amendment Act acknowledged that there was
			<lb />
			criticism of the existing system of appointment of judges (where the
			<lb />
			executive had the primacy) and that this needed change, hence the need for
			<lb />
			an Amendment Act. 280
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			110. On the issue of executive interference in the appointment of judges,
			<lb />
			the Bench found that interference went to the extent of impermissibly
			<lb />
			re-opening the appointment process even though a recommendation for the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge had been accepted by the Chief Justice of India. It
			<lb />
			was observed:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;From the affidavits filed by the Union of India and the statements made
			<lb />
			by learned Attorney General on the different occasions when the matter
			<lb />
			was heard we found that the Union Government had adopted the policy of
			<lb />
			reopening recommendations even though the same had been cleared by the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India on the basis that there had in the meantime been a
			<lb />
			change in the personnel of the Chief Justice of the High Court or the Chief
			<lb />
			Minister of the State. The selection of a person as a Judge has nothing
			<lb />
			personal either to the Chief Justice of the High Court or the Chief Minister
			<lb />
			of the State. The High Court is an institution of national importance
			<lb />
			wherein the person appointed as a Judge functions in an impersonal
			<lb />
			manner. The process of selection is intended to be totally honest and
			<lb />
			upright with a view to finding out the most suitable person for the vacancy.
			<lb />
			If in a given case the Chief Justice of the High Court has recommended
			<lb />
			and the name has been considered by the Chief Minister and duly
			<lb />
			processed through the Governor so as to reach the hands of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India through the Ministry of Justice and the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India as the highest judicial authority in the country, on due application of
			<lb />
			his mind, has given finality to the process at his level, there cannot
			<lb />
			ordinarily be any justification for reopening the matter merely because
			<lb />
			there has been a change in the personnel of the Chief Justice or the Chief
			<lb />
			Minister of the State concerned.&quot; 281
			<lb />
			111. Apart from the above, the Bench was of the view that the
			<lb />
			interpretation given by the majority in the First Judges case to &apos;consultation&apos;
			<lb />
			was not correctly appreciated in the constitutional scheme. It was also felt
			<lb />
			that the role of the institution of the Chief Justice of India in the
			<lb />
			constitutional scheme had been denuded in the First Judges case. Keeping
			<lb />
			all these factors in mind, particularly the functioning of the appointment
			<lb />
			process and the acknowledgement of the Union Government that a change
			<lb />
			was needed, it was observed:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The view taken by Bhagwati, J., Fazal Ali, J., Desai, J., and
			<lb />
			Venkataramiah, J., to which we will presently advert, in our opinion, not
			<lb />
			only seriously detracts from and denudes the primacy of the position,
			<lb />
			implicit in the constitutional scheme, of the Chief Justice of India in the
			<lb />
			consultative process but also whittles down the very significance of
			<lb />
			&quot;consultation&quot; as required to be understood in the constitutional scheme
			<lb />
			and context. This bears both on the substance and the process of the
			<lb />
			constitutional scheme….. Consistent with the constitutional purpose and
			<lb />
			process it becomes imperative that the role of the institution of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India be recognised as of crucial importance in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointments to the Supreme Court and the High Courts of the States. We
			<lb />
			are of the view that this aspect dealt with in Gupta case requires
			<lb />
			reconsideration by a larger bench.&quot; 282
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			112. The issues for consideration of a larger Bench were then formulated in
			<lb />
			the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The points which require to be reconsidered relate to and arise from the
			<lb />
			views of the majority opinion touching the very status of &quot;consultation&quot;
			<lb />
			generally and in particular with reference to &quot;consultation&quot; with Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India and, secondly, as to the primacy of the role of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India. The content and quality of consultation may perhaps vary
			<lb />
			in different situations in the interaction between the executive and the
			<lb />
			judicial organs of the State and some aspects may require clarification.&quot; 283
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			113. It was also observed that a view was expressed in the First Judges
			<lb />
			case that the government of the State could initiate a proposal for the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge but that the proposal could not be sent directly to the
			<lb />
			Union Government, but should first be sent to the Chief Justice of the High
			<lb />
			Court. 284 Notwithstanding this clear exposition, the procedure was being
			<lb />
			distorted by the executive and a proposal for the appointment of judge of the
			<lb />
			High Court was being sent directly to the Union Government. It was said in
			<lb />
			this regard:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;But it has been mentioned that a practice is sought to be developed where
			<lb />
			the executive government of the State sends up the proposals directly to
			<lb />
			the Centre without reference to the Chief Justice of the State. This is a
			<lb />
			distortion of the constitutional scheme and is wholly impermissible. So far
			<lb />
			as the executive is concerned, the &apos;right&apos; to initiate an appointment should
			<lb />
			be limited to suggesting appropriate names to the Chief Justice of the High
			<lb />
			Courts or the Chief Justice of India. If the recommendation is to emanate
			<lb />
			directly from a source other than that of the Chief Justices of the High
			<lb />
			Courts in the case of the High Courts and the Chief Justice of India in the
			<lb />
			case of both the High Courts and the Supreme Court it would be difficult
			<lb />
			for an appropriate selection to be made. It has been increasingly felt over
			<lb />
			the decades that there has been an anxiety on the part of the government of
			<lb />
			the day to assert its choice in the ultimate selection of Judges. If the power
			<lb />
			to recommend would vest in the State Government or even the Central
			<lb />
			Government, the picture is likely to be blurred and the process of selection
			<lb />
			ultimately may turn out to be difficult.&quot; 285
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			114. By-passing the Chief Justice of the High Court in the matter of
			<lb />
			recommending a person for appointment as a judge of the High Court was an
			<lb />
			unhealthy practice that the political executive of the State was trying to
			<lb />
			establish since around the time of Independence. This &apos;subterfuge&apos; was
			<lb />
			deprecated on more than one occasion, as noticed above.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			115. Another practice that the political executive was trying to establish
			<lb />
			was to recommend persons for appointment as a judge of the High Court to
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of that High Court. In this context, it was also stated in
			<lb />
			Subhash Sharma (as quoted above) that: &apos;It has been increasingly felt over
			<lb />
			the decades that there has been an anxiety on the part of the government of
			<lb />
			the day to assert its choice in the ultimate selection of Judges.&apos; 286 This
			<lb />
			unequivocally indicates that the malaise of executive interference in
			<lb />
			appointing judges to the superior judiciary, first highlighted in the
			<lb />
			Memorandum emanating from the Chief Justices Conference and then by the
			<lb />
			LCI in its 14 th Report, continued in some form or the other through the entire
			<lb />
			period from Independence till the early 1990s. In addition, the
			<lb />
			recommendation given in the 14 th Report of the LCI in Chapter 6 regarding
			<lb />
			the executive not being entitled to &apos;propose a nominee of its own and
			<lb />
			forward it to the Centre&apos; was not given the due weight and consideration that
			<lb />
			it deserved from the executive.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			116. Quite clearly, some complex issues arose in the matter of appointment
			<lb />
			of judges primarily due to the interference of the political executive and
			<lb />
			these needed consideration by a larger Bench. Well established and accepted
			<lb />
			constitutional conventions were sought to be disregarded by the political
			<lb />
			executive. If the independence of the judiciary was to be maintained and
			<lb />
			parliamentary democracy was to be retained, the First Judges case and the
			<lb />
			appointment process needed a fresh look.
			<lb />
			Second Judges case -6.10.1993
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			117. As mentioned above, the Second Judges case was the result of an
			<lb />
			acknowledgement that: (1) The existing system of appointment of judges in
			<lb />
			which the executive had the &apos;ultimate power&apos; needed reconsideration since
			<lb />
			that &apos;ultimate power&apos; was being abused; (2) The existing system of
			<lb />
			appointment of judges resulted in some appointments in which merit was
			<lb />
			overlooked due to executive interference or for extraneous considerations.
			<lb />
			The Chief Justice of the High Court was occasionally by-passed by the
			<lb />
			political executive and a recommendation for the appointment of a person as
			<lb />
			a judge of the High Court was made directly to the Union Government. This
			<lb />
			unfortunate situation had continued for more than 40 years and an attempt to
			<lb />
			bring about a change was made and so a Constitution Amendment Bill was
			<lb />
			introduced in Parliament, but it lapsed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			118. In the Second Judges case it was held by Justice Pandian: (1) The
			<lb />
			selection and appointment of a proper and fit candidate to the superior
			<lb />
			judiciary is one of the inseparable and vital conditions for securing the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary. 287 &apos;The erroneous appointment of an
			<lb />
			unsuitable person is bound to produce irreparable damage to the faith of the
			<lb />
			community in the administration of justice and to inflict serious injury to the
			<lb />
			public interest...&apos; 288 (2) Yet another facet of the independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary is the separation between the executive and the judiciary (including
			<lb />
			the superior judiciary) 289 postulated by Article 50 of the Constitution. 290 (3)
			<lb />
			The Memorandum of Procedure for the selection and appointment of judges

			<lb />

			<lb />
			executive in the public services of the State.
			<lb />
			Page 643
			<lb />
			filed by the Union of India along with the written submissions relating to the
			<lb />
			pre First Judges case period and the extant procedure as mentioned in the
			<lb />
			121 st Report of the LCI relating to the post First Judges case period are
			<lb />
			more or less the same. They indicate that the recommendation for filling up a
			<lb />
			vacancy in the Supreme Court is initiated by the Chief Justice of India and
			<lb />
			the recommendation for filling up a vacancy in the High Court is initiated by
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of the High Court. The Chief Minister of a State may
			<lb />
			recommend a person for filling up a vacancy in the High Court, but that is to
			<lb />
			be routed only through the Chief Justice of the High Court. 291 (4) Reiterating
			<lb />
			the view expressed in Sankalchand Sheth and the First Judges case it was
			<lb />
			held that for the purposes of consultation, the materials before the President
			<lb />
			and the Chief Justice of India must be identical. 292 (5) For the appointment of
			<lb />
			a judge of the Supreme Court (under Article 124(2) of the Constitution) or a
			<lb />
			judge of a High Court (under Article 217(1) of the Constitution) consultation
			<lb />
			with the Chief Justice of India is mandatory. 293 (6) In the process of
			<lb />
			constitutional consultation in selecting judges to the Supreme Court or the
			<lb />
			High Court and transfer of judges of the High Court, the opinion of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India is entitled to primacy. 294 (7) Agreeing with the majority
			<lb />
			opinion written by Justice J.S. Verma, it was held that if there are weighty
			<lb />
			and cogent reasons for not accepting the recommendation of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India for the appointment of a judge, then the appointment may not
			<lb />
			be made. However, if the &apos;weighty and cogent&apos; reasons are not acceptable to
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India, and the recommendation is reiterated, then the
			<lb />
			appointment shall be made. 295 (8) The majority opinion in the First Judges
			<lb />
			case regarding the primacy of the executive in the matter of appointment of
			<lb />
			judges was overruled. 296
			<lb />
			119. Justice Ahmadi dissented with the opinion of the majority and
			<lb />
			concluded: (1) Judicial independence is ingrained in our constitutional
			<lb />
			scheme and Article 50 of the Constitution &apos;illuminates it&apos;. 297 (2) The First
			<lb />
			Judges case was not required to be overruled but on the question of primacy
			<lb />
			in the matter of appointment of judges, the opinion of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India is entitled to &apos;graded weight&apos;. 298
			<lb />
			120. Justice Kuldip Singh agreed with the majority and laid great stress on
			<lb />
			constitutional conventions that had evolved over several decades. The
			<lb />
			learned judge held: (1) Security of tenure is not the only source of
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary but &apos;there has to be an independent judiciary
			<lb />
			as an institution.&apos; 299 (2) Independence of the judiciary is inextricably linked
			<lb />
			and connected with the constitutional process of appointment of judges of
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary. There cannot be an independent judiciary when the
			<lb />
			295 Paragraph 212
			<lb />
			296 Paragraph 254
			<lb />
			297 Paragraph 313
			<lb />
			298 Paragraph 303 and 313. It was observed in paragraph 303: &quot;If the President has to act on the aid and
			<lb />
			advice of the Council of Ministers it is difficult to hold that he is bound by the opinion of the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India unless we hold that the Council of Ministers including the Prime Minister would be bound by the
			<lb />
			opinion of the Chief Justice of India, a construction which to our mind is too artificial and strained to
			<lb />
			commend acceptance.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			299 Paragraph 334
			<lb />
			Page 645
			<lb />
			power of appointment of judges vests in the executive. 300 (3) The President is
			<lb />
			bound by the advice given by the Council of Ministers. 301 (4) A constitutional
			<lb />
			convention is established since the Government of India Act, 1935 (I would
			<lb />
			add the words &apos;at least&apos;) that the appointment of judges was invariably made
			<lb />
			with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India. The opinion and
			<lb />
			recommendation of the Chief Justice of India in the matter of appointment of
			<lb />
			judges binds the executive. 302 (5) In the matter of appointment of judges,
			<lb />
			consultation with the Chief Justice of India is mandatory. 303 (6) In the
			<lb />
			consultation process under Article 124(2) and 217(1) of the Constitution, the
			<lb />
			advice and recommendation of the Chief Justice of India is binding on the
			<lb />
			executive and must be the final word. The majority view in the First Judges
			<lb />
			case does not lay down the correct law. 304
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(7) For the purposes of Article 124(2) and 217(1) of the Constitution, the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India and the Chief Justice of the High Court mean the
			<lb />
			functionaries representing their respective Court. 305
			<lb />
			121. One of the more interesting facts pointed out by Justice Kuldip Singh
			<lb />
			is that from 1 st January, 1983 (after the decision in the First Judges case) till
			<lb />
			10 th April, 1993 (that is during a period of ten years) the opinion of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India was not accepted by the President in as many as seven cases.
			<lb />
			This is worth contrasting with a part of the period before the &apos;ultimate
			<lb />
			300 Paragraph 335
			<lb />
			301 Paragraph 277, 356, 383 and 411
			<lb />
			302 Paragraph 359, 371,373 and 376. The figures relating to the appointment of judges have been mentioned
			<lb />
			in paragraphs 367 and 369.
			<lb />
			303 Paragraph 377 and 411
			<lb />
			304 Paragraph 385, 387 and 411
			<lb />
			305 Paragraph 392 and 411
			<lb />
			Page 646
			<lb />
			power&apos; theory was propounded when the opinion of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India was not accepted by the President only in one case and in that case, the
			<lb />
			opinion of the Chief Justice of the High Court (not the political executive)
			<lb />
			was accepted. This is what the learned judge had to say:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Mr S.K. Bose, Joint Secretary, Department of Justice, Ministry of Law
			<lb />
			and Justice has filed an affidavit dated April 22, 1993 before us. In para 6
			<lb />
			of the said affidavit it is stated as under:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;As regards the appointments of Judges made, not in consonance
			<lb />
			with the views expressed by the Chief Justice of India, it is
			<lb />
			respectfully submitted that since January 1, 1983 to April 10, 1993,
			<lb />
			there have been only seven such cases, five of these were in 1983
			<lb />
			(2 in January 1983, 2 in July 1983, 1 in August 1983); one in
			<lb />
			September 1985 and one in March 1991, out of a total of 547
			<lb />
			appointments made during this period.&quot;
			<lb />
			It is thus obvious from the facts and figures given by the executive itself
			<lb />
			that in actual practice the recommendations of the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			have invariably been accepted.&quot; 306
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			122. Justice Verma speaking for the majority held: (1) Independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary has to be safeguarded not only by providing security of tenure and
			<lb />
			other conditions of service, but also by preventing political considerations in
			<lb />
			making appointments of judges to the superior judiciary. 307
			<lb />
			(2) In the matter of appointment of judges, primacy was given to the
			<lb />
			executive in the Government of India Act, 1919 and the Government of India
			<lb />
			Act, 1935 but in the constitutional scheme, primacy of the executive is
			<lb />
			excluded. 308
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(3) The Chief Justice of India and the Chief Justice of the High Court
			<lb />
			are &apos;best equipped to know and assess the worth of a candidate, and his
			<lb />
			306 Paragraphs 369 and 370
			<lb />
			307 Paragraph 447
			<lb />
			308 Paragraph 444, 446, 448 and 450
			<lb />
			Page 647
			<lb />
			suitability for appointment as a superior judge.&apos; In the event of a difference
			<lb />
			of opinion between the executive and the judiciary, the opinion of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India should have the greatest weight. [This echoed Dr.
			<lb />
			Ambedkar&apos;s view that consultation would be between persons who are well
			<lb />
			qualified to give advice in matters of this sort.] Therefore, since primacy is
			<lb />
			not with the executive, then in such a situation, it must lie with the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India. 309 This certainly does not exclude the executive from the
			<lb />
			appointment process. The executive might be aware (unlike a Chief Justice)
			<lb />
			of some antecedents or some information relatable to the personal character
			<lb />
			or trait of a lawyer or a judge which might have a bearing on the potential of
			<lb />
			a person becoming a good judge. 310 This might form the basis for rejecting a
			<lb />
			recommendation for the appointment of a person as a judge by the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India. 311
			<lb />
			(4) Primacy of the opinion of the Chief Justice of India is not to
			<lb />
			his/her individual opinion but to the collective opinion of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India and his/her senior colleagues or those who are associated with the
			<lb />
			function of appointment of judges. 312 Therefore, the President may not accept
			<lb />
			the recommendation of a person for appointment as a judge, if the
			<lb />
			recommendation of the Chief Justice of India is not supported by the
			<lb />
			unanimous opinion of the other senior judges. 313 The President may return
			<lb />
			for reconsideration a unanimous recommendation for good reasons.
			<lb />
			However, in the latter event, if the Chief Justice of India and the other judges
			<lb />
			consulted by him/her, unanimously reiterate the recommendation &apos;with
			<lb />
			reasons for not withdrawing the recommendation, then that appointment as a
			<lb />
			matter of healthy convention ought to be made.&apos; 314 (The key word here is
			<lb />
			unanimous -both at the stage of the initial recommendation and at the stage
			<lb />
			of reiteration).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(5) For appointing a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court,
			<lb />
			consultation with the Chief Justice of India or the Chief Justice of the High
			<lb />
			Court is mandatory. 315
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(6) The President in Articles 124(2) and 217(1) of the Constitution
			<lb />
			means the President acting in accordance with the advice of the Council of
			<lb />
			Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head. 316
			<lb />
			(7) The advice given by the Council of Ministers to the President
			<lb />
			should be in accord with the Constitution. Such an advice is binding on the
			<lb />
			President. Since the opinion of the Chief Justice of India (representing the
			<lb />
			Judiciary) has finality, the advice of the Council of Ministers to the President
			<lb />
			must be in accordance with the opinion of the Chief Justice of India. 317
			<lb />
			(8) The convention is that the appointment process is initiated by the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India for the appointment of a judge to the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			and by the Chief Justice of the High Court for the appointment of a judge to
			<lb />
			the High Court. There is no reason to depart from this convention. 318
			<lb />
			(9) The law laid down in the First Judges case is not the correct
			<lb />
			view. 319
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			123. In his otherwise dissenting opinion, Justice Punchhi supported the
			<lb />
			view taken by Justice Verma to the extent that the executive could not
			<lb />
			disapprove the views of the Chief Justice of India or the views of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of the High Court (as the case may be) when a recommendation is
			<lb />
			made for the appointment of a judge to a superior court. 320
			<lb />
			124. The most significant feature of the Second Judges case is that it
			<lb />
			introduced what has come to be called a &apos;collegium system&apos; of consultation
			<lb />
			for the appointment of judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts. As
			<lb />
			far as the Chief Justice of India is concerned, the collegium system
			<lb />
			broad-based his/her role in the appointment of judges of the High Courts and
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court and (in one sense) diluted his/her role in the appointment
			<lb />
			process by taking it out of the individualized or personalized role of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India as thought of by Dr. Ambedkar. The consultative role
			<lb />
			of the Chief Justice of India in Article 124 of the Constitution was radically
			<lb />
			transformed through a pragmatic interpretation of that provision. How did
			<lb />
			this happen?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			125. In the Second Judges case certain norms were laid down by Justice
			<lb />
			Verma in the matter of appointment of judges. These norms were: For the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges in the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice of India must
			<lb />
			ascertain the views of the two senior-most judges of the Supreme Court and
			<lb />
			of the senior-most judge in the Supreme Court from the High Court of the
			<lb />
			candidate concerned. Through this process, the individual opinion of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India was substituted by the collective opinion of several
			<lb />
			judges. In this sense the opinion of the Chief Justice of India in the
			<lb />
			consultative process was made broad-based and ceased to be individualized.
			<lb />
			At this stage it is worth recalling the words of Dr. Ambedkar that &apos;the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice, despite his eminence, had all the failings, sentiments and prejudices
			<lb />
			of common people.&apos; The apprehension or fear that Dr. Ambedkar had in this
			<lb />
			regard in case the Chief Justice of India were to act in an individual or
			<lb />
			personal capacity was now buried. 321 A somewhat similar norm was laid
			<lb />
			down for consultation for the appointment of a judge of the High Court. This
			<lb />
			is what was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;This opinion has to be formed in a pragmatic manner and past practice
			<lb />
			based on convention is a safe guide. In matters relating to appointments in
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court, the opinion given by the Chief Justice of India in the
			<lb />
			consultative process has to be formed taking into account the views of the
			<lb />
			two seniormost Judges of the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice of India is
			<lb />
			also expected to ascertain the views of the senior-most Judge of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court whose opinion is likely to be significant in adjudging the
			<lb />
			suitability of the candidate, by reason of the fact that he has come from the
			<lb />
			same High Court, or otherwise. Article 124(2) is an indication that
			<lb />
			ascertainment of the views of some other Judges of the Supreme Court is
			<lb />
			requisite. The object underlying Article 124(2) is achieved in this manner
			<lb />
			as the Chief Justice of India consults them for the formation of his opinion.
			<lb />
			This provision in Article 124(2) is the basis for the existing convention
			<lb />
			which requires the Chief Justice of India to consult some Judges of the
			<lb />
			321 According to the learned Attorney-General, this would have made Dr. Ambedkar turn in his grave. Not
			<lb />
			so and quite to the contrary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Page 651
			<lb />
			Supreme Court before making his recommendation. This ensures that the
			<lb />
			opinion of the Chief Justice of India is not merely his individual opinion,
			<lb />
			but an opinion formed collectively by a body of men at the apex level in
			<lb />
			the judiciary.
			<lb />
			In matters relating to appointments in the High Courts, the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India is expected to take into account the views of his colleagues in the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court who are likely to be conversant with the affairs of the
			<lb />
			concerned High Court. The Chief Justice of India may also ascertain the
			<lb />
			views of one or more senior Judges of that High Court whose opinion,
			<lb />
			according to the Chief Justice of India, is likely to be significant in the
			<lb />
			formation of his opinion. The opinion of the Chief Justice of the High
			<lb />
			Court would be entitled to the greatest weight, and the opinion of the other
			<lb />
			functionaries involved must be given due weight, in the formation of the
			<lb />
			opinion of the Chief Justice of India. The opinion of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			the High Court must be formed after ascertaining the views of at least the
			<lb />
			two seniormost Judges of the High Court.&quot; 322
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			126. The importance of the role of the Chief Justice of India was
			<lb />
			acknowledged in that it was observed that the constitutional convention was
			<lb />
			that no appointment should be made by the President under Article 124(2)
			<lb />
			and Article 217(1) of the Constitution unless it was in conformity with the
			<lb />
			final opinion of the Chief Justice of India. It was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The opinion of the Chief Justice of India, for the purpose of Articles
			<lb />
			124(2) and 217(1), so given, has primacy in the matter of all appointments;
			<lb />
			and no appointment can be made by the President under these provisions
			<lb />
			to the Supreme Court and the High Courts, unless it is in conformity with
			<lb />
			the final opinion of the Chief Justice of India, formed in the manner
			<lb />
			indicated.&quot; 323
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			127. The &apos;manner indicated&apos; was that if a recommendation is returned by
			<lb />
			the executive (for cogent reasons) to the Chief Justice of India and the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India reiterates the recommendation with the unanimous
			<lb />
			agreement of the judges earlier consulted, then the appointment should be
			<lb />
			made &apos;as a matter of healthy convention&apos;. This is what was said in this
			<lb />
			context:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Non-appointment of anyone recommended, on the ground of
			<lb />
			unsuitability, must be for good reasons, disclosed to the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India to enable him to reconsider and withdraw his recommendation on
			<lb />
			those considerations. If the Chief Justice of India does not find it necessary
			<lb />
			to withdraw his recommendation even thereafter, but the other Judges of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court who have been consulted in the matter are of the view
			<lb />
			that it ought to be withdrawn, the non-appointment of that person, for
			<lb />
			reasons to be recorded, may be permissible in the public interest. If the
			<lb />
			non-appointment in a rare case, on this ground, turns out to be a mistake,
			<lb />
			that mistake in the ultimate public interest is less harmful than a wrong
			<lb />
			appointment. However, if after due consideration of the reasons disclosed
			<lb />
			to the Chief Justice of India, that recommendation is reiterated by the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India with the unanimous agreement of the Judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court consulted in the matter, with reasons for not withdrawing
			<lb />
			the recommendation, then that appointment as a matter of healthy
			<lb />
			convention ought to be made.&quot; 324
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			128. The norms took the form of conclusions that became binding on the
			<lb />
			Judiciary and the Executive. It is not necessary to reproduce the conclusions
			<lb />
			arrived at.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			129. An important aspect of the appointment process, which was adverted
			<lb />
			to by Justice Verma, is the constitutional convention that the
			<lb />
			recommendation must be initiated by and must originate from the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of the High Court (for appointment to the High Court) and from the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India (for appointment to the Supreme Court). In the event
			<lb />
			the Chief Minister of a State recommends a person for appointment as a
			<lb />
			judge of the High Court, it must be routed only through the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			the High Court. It is then for the said Chief Justice to consult his colleagues
			<lb />
			(and others, if necessary) and decide whether or not the person should be
			<lb />
			formally recommended. If the Chief Justice of the High Court recommends
			<lb />
			that person, the procedure as mentioned in the Second Judges case would
			<lb />
			thereafter follow. If the Chief Justice of the High Court decides not to
			<lb />
			recommend that person for appointment, the matter stands closed and,
			<lb />
			therefore, the question of making an appointment without the consent of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India simply does not and cannot arise. It is this
			<lb />
			constitutionally and conventionally accepted procedure, which is apparently
			<lb />
			not acceptable to the political executive, that has led to the political
			<lb />
			executive by-passing the Chief Justice of a High Court and directly
			<lb />
			recommending to the Union Government a person for appointment as a
			<lb />
			judge of the High Court. Be that as it may, the majority view expressed in the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case restored the constitutional position envisaged by Dr.
			<lb />
			Ambedkar by diluting the individual authority of the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			and conferring it on a collegium of judges, which is perhaps in consonance
			<lb />
			with the views of Dr. Ambedkar.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			130. According to the learned Attorney-General, these conclusions turned
			<lb />
			Article 124(2) and Article 217(1) of the Constitution &apos;on their head&apos; and even
			<lb />
			Justice Verma, the author of the judgment felt that the decision required a
			<lb />
			rethink. The reference was to an interview given by Justice Verma post his
			<lb />
			retirement. In that, it was said by Justice Verma:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;My 1993 judgment which holds the field, was very much misunderstood
			<lb />
			and misused. It was in that context that I said the working of the judgment
			<lb />
			now for some time is raising serious questions, which cannot be called
			<lb />
			unreasonable. Therefore some kind of rethink is required.&quot; 325
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			131. It appears that the misunderstanding of the decision in the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case continues even today, especially by the political executive. The
			<lb />
			misunderstanding is not due to any lack of clarity in the decision rendered by
			<lb />
			this Court but due to the discomfort in the &apos;working of the judgment&apos;. I say
			<lb />
			this because it was submitted by the learned Attorney-General and learned
			<lb />
			counsel for some States that the Second Judges case left the executive with
			<lb />
			no role (or no effective role) to play in the appointment of a judge of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court or the High Court particularly since the opinion of the
			<lb />
			executive is now rendered meaningless. Nothing can be further from the
			<lb />
			truth. The executive continues to have a vital role to play and in some cases,
			<lb />
			the final say in the appointment of a judge -the misunderstanding of the
			<lb />
			judgment is due to the completely and regrettably defeatist attitude of the
			<lb />
			Union of India and the States or their view that in the matter of appointment
			<lb />
			of judges, it is their way or the highway. The Constitution of India is a sacred
			<lb />
			document and not a Rubik&apos;s cube that can be manipulated and maneuvered
			<lb />
			by the political executive any which way only to suit its immediate needs.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			132. In an article found on the website of the Tamil Nadu State Judicial
			<lb />
			Academy, Justice Verma adverted to the appointment process in the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case and the role of the executive and said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The clear language of the decision leaves no room for any doubt that the
			<lb />
			executive has a participatory role in these appointments; the opinion of the
			<lb />
			executive is weightier in the area of antecedents and personal character and
			<lb />
			conduct of the candidate; the power of non-appointment on this ground is
			<lb />
			expressly with the executive, notwithstanding the recommendation of the
			<lb />
			CJI; and that doubtful antecedents etc. are alone sufficient for
			<lb />
			non-appointment by the executive. The decision also holds that the opinion
			<lb />
			of the judicial collegium, if not unanimous does not bind the executive to
			<lb />
			make the appointment.
			<lb />
			Some reported instances in the recent past of the executive failing to
			<lb />
			perform its duty by exercise of this power even when the recommendation
			<lb />
			of the judicial collegium was not unanimous and the then President of
			<lb />
			India had returned it for reconsideration, are not only inexplicable but also
			<lb />
			a misapplication of the decision, which the CJI, Balakrishnan rightly says
			<lb />
			is binding during its validity. Such instances only prove the prophecy of
			<lb />
			Dr. Rajendra Prasad that the Constitution will be as good as the people
			<lb />
			who work it. Have any system you like, its worth and efficacy will depend
			<lb />
			on the worth of the people who work it! It is, therefore, the working of the
			<lb />
			system that must be monitored to ensure transparency and
			<lb />
			accountability.&quot; 326
			<lb />
			A little later in the article Justice Verma says (and this is also adverted to in
			<lb />
			the interview referred to by the learned Attorney-General):
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;The recent aberrations are in the application of the Second Judge&apos;s case in
			<lb />
			making the appointments, and not because of it. This is what I had pointed
			<lb />
			out in my letter of 5 December 2005 to CJI, Y.K.Sabharwal with copy to
			<lb />
			the two senior most judges, who included the present CJI,
			<lb />
			K.G.Balakrishnan.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			133. The misunderstanding is, therefore, of the political executive and no
			<lb />
			one else. However, as pointed out by the learned Attorney-General, the
			<lb />
			merits or demerits of the Second Judges case is not in issue after the 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act and therefore no further comment is made,
			<lb />
			although it must be said, quite categorically, that the political executive has
			<lb />
			completely misunderstood the scope and impact of the Second Judges case
			<lb />
			and the working of the collegium system.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Third Judges case -28.10.1998
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			134. Special Reference No. 1 of 1998 is commonly referred to as the Third
			<lb />
			Judges case. The President sought the advisory opinion of this Court under
			<lb />
			Article 143 of the Constitution on the following, amongst other, questions:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;(1) whether the expression &apos;consultation with the Chief Justice of India&apos; in
			<lb />
			Articles 217(1) and 222(1) requires consultation with a plurality of Judges
			<lb />
			in the formation of the opinion of the Chief Justice of India or does the sole
			<lb />
			individual opinion of the Chief Justice of India constitute consultation
			<lb />
			within the meaning of the said articles.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(3) whether Article 124(2) as interpreted in the said judgment [Second
			<lb />
			Judges case] requires the Chief Justice of India to consult only the two
			<lb />
			seniormost Judges or whether there should be wider consultation according
			<lb />
			to past practice.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(4) whether the Chief Justice of India is entitled to act solely in his
			<lb />
			individual capacity, without consultation with other Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in respect of all materials and information conveyed by the
			<lb />
			Government of India for non-appointment of a Judge recommended for
			<lb />
			appointment;&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			135. At the outset, it must be noted that the learned Attorney-General stated
			<lb />
			at the hearing of the Presidential Reference that the Central Government was
			<lb />
			neither seeking a review nor a reconsideration of the Second Judges case.
			<lb />
			Therefore, the answers to the Presidential Reference do not depart from the
			<lb />
			conclusions arrived at by this Court in the Second Judges case. In that sense,
			<lb />
			this opinion did not take the substantive discussion much further though it
			<lb />
			substantially resolved some procedural issues and filled in the gaps relating
			<lb />
			to the process of appointment of judges to the superior judiciary. In any
			<lb />
			event, the answers to the three questions mentioned above are:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;1. The expression &quot;consultation with the Chief Justice of India&quot; in
			<lb />
			Articles 217(1) and 222(1) of the Constitution of India requires
			<lb />
			consultation with a plurality of Judges in the formation of the opinion of
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India. The sole individual opinion of the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India does not constitute &quot;consultation&quot; within the meaning of the said
			<lb />
			articles.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3. The Chief Justice of India must make a recommendation to appoint a
			<lb />
			Judge of the Supreme Court and to transfer a Chief Justice or puisne Judge
			<lb />
			of a High Court in consultation with the four seniormost puisne Judges of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court. Insofar as an appointment to the High Court is
			<lb />
			concerned, the recommendation must be made in consultation with the two
			<lb />
			seniormost puisne Judges of the Supreme Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4. The Chief Justice of India is not entitled to act solely in his individual
			<lb />
			capacity, without consultation with other Judges of the Supreme Court, in
			<lb />
			respect of materials and information conveyed by the Government of India
			<lb />
			for non-appointment of a Judge recommended for appointment.&quot; 327
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			136. The decision in the Second Judges case read with the opinion given
			<lb />
			by this Court to the various questions raised in the Presidential Reference or
			<lb />
			the Third Judges case fully settled the controversies surrounding the
			<lb />
			procedure to be adopted in the appointment of judges to the superior
			<lb />
			judiciary. Issues of primacy of views and consultation with the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India were all answered by the decision and the opinion.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			137. It is important to note that the Third Judges case modified one
			<lb />
			important norm or conclusion of the Second Judges case. The modification
			<lb />
			was that the &apos;collegium&apos; for appointment of judges in the Supreme Court was
			<lb />
			expanded to consist of the Chief Justice of India and four senior-most judges
			<lb />
			rather than the two senior-most judges as concluded in the Second Judges
			<lb />
			case. In this manner, the consultation with the Chief Justice of India was
			<lb />
			further broad-based. It was clarified in conclusion 9 as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;9. Recommendations made by the Chief Justice of India without
			<lb />
			complying with the norms and requirements of the consultation process, as
			<lb />
			aforestated, are not binding upon the Government of India.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			This conclusion is important, but seems to have been ignored or overlooked
			<lb />
			by the President.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Samsher Singh&apos;s case
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			138. For a complete picture of the judicial pronouncements on the subject, it
			<lb />
			is also necessary to refer to the decision rendered by this Court in
			<lb />
			Samsher Singh v. State of Punjab. 328
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			139. This case related to the termination of the services of two officers of
			<lb />
			the subordinate judicial service by the Governor of the State. The issue was
			<lb />
			whether the Governor could exercise his discretion in the matter personally
			<lb />
			or should act on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The judicial officers
			<lb />
			contended that the Governor was obliged to exercise his personal discretion
			<lb />
			and reliance was placed on Sardari Lal v. Union of India 329 in which it was
			<lb />
			held that for invoking the &apos;pleasure doctrine&apos; under Article 311(2) of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, the personal satisfaction of the President is necessary for
			<lb />
			dispensing with an inquiry under clause (c) of the proviso to Article 311(2) of
			<lb />
			the Constitution. On the other hand, the State contended that the Governor
			<lb />
			was obliged to act only on the advice of the Council of Ministers.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			140. This Court speaking through Chief Justice A.N. Ray (for himself and
			<lb />
			four other learned judges) overruled Sardari Lal and held that the decision
			<lb />
			did not correctly state the law. It was held that under the Rules of Business,
			<lb />
			the decision of the concerned Minister or officer is the decision of the
			<lb />
			President or the Governor as the case may be. It was then concluded:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;For the foregoing reasons we hold that the President or the Governor acts
			<lb />
			on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister
			<lb />
			at the head in the case of the Union and the Chief Minister at the head in
			<lb />
			the case of State in all matters which vests in the Executive whether those
			<lb />
			functions are executive or legislative in character. Neither the President nor
			<lb />
			the Governor is to exercise the executive functions personally. The present
			<lb />
			appeals concern the appointment of persons other than District Judges to
			<lb />
			the Judicial Services of the State which is to be made by the Governor as
			<lb />
			contemplated in Article 234 of the Constitution after consultation with the
			<lb />
			State Public Service Commission and the High Court. Appointment or
			<lb />
			dismissal or removal of persons belonging to the Judicial Service of the
			<lb />
			State is not a personal function but is an executive function of the
			<lb />
			Governor exercised in accordance with the rules in that behalf under the
			<lb />
			Constitution.&quot; 330
			<lb />
			141. In a separate but concurring judgment authored by Justice Krishna Iyer
			<lb />
			(for himself and Justice Bhagwati) the view expressed by Chief Justice Ray
			<lb />
			was accepted in the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;We declare the law of this branch of our Constitution to be that the
			<lb />
			President and Governor, custodians of all executive and other powers
			<lb />
			under various articles shall, by virtue of these provisions, exercise their
			<lb />
			formal constitutional powers only upon and in accordance with the advice
			<lb />
			of their Ministers save in a few well-known exceptional situations. Without
			<lb />
			being dogmatic or exhaustive, these situations relate to (a) the choice of
			<lb />
			Prime Minister (Chief Minister), restricted though this choice is by the
			<lb />
			paramount consideration that he should command a majority in the House;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(b) the dismissal of a Government which has lost its majority in the House,
			<lb />
			but refuses to quit office; (c) the dissolution of the House where an appeal
			<lb />
			to the country is necessitous, although in this area the head of State should
			<lb />
			avoid getting involved in politics and must be advised by his Prime
			<lb />
			Minister (Chief Minister) who will eventually take the responsibility for
			<lb />
			the step.&quot; 331
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			142. An additional reason was given by the two learned judges for coming
			<lb />
			to this conclusion and that is also important for our present purposes. The
			<lb />
			additional reason relates to the independence of the judiciary. For this,
			<lb />
			reference was made to Jyoti Prokash Mitter v. Chief Justice, Calcutta. 332
			<lb />
			The question in that case related to the determination of the age of a sitting
			<lb />
			judge of the High Court under Article 217(3) of the Constitution. 333 This
			<lb />
			Court held that the age determination should be by the President
			<lb />
			uninfluenced by the views of the executive. This was on the ground that were
			<lb />
			the executive to make the determination of the age of a sitting judge, it would
			<lb />

			<lb />
			331 Paragraph 154
			<lb />
			332 [1965] 2 SCR 53 (Five Judges Bench)
			<lb />
			333 217. Appointment and conditions of the office of a Judge of a High Court. -
			<lb />
			(3) If any question arises as to the age of a Judge of a High Court, the question shall be decided by
			<lb />
			the President after consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the decision of the President shall be
			<lb />
			final.

		<p>
			&apos;seriously affect the independence of the Judiciary.&apos; This view was
			<lb />
			subsequently reiterated in Union of India v. Jyoti Prokash Mitter. 334
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			143. The learned judges then held, on the basis of the scheme of the
			<lb />
			Constitution that had already been adverted to, that the President means the
			<lb />
			Council of Ministers and the independence of the judiciary has been
			<lb />
			safeguarded by Article 217(3) of the Constitution by making mandatory the
			<lb />
			consultation with the Chief Justice of India in regard to age determination.
			<lb />
			This would prevent the possibility of extraneous considerations entering into
			<lb />
			the decision of the Minister if he/she departs from the views of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India. It was held that in all conceivable cases, consultation with
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India should be accepted by the executive and if there is
			<lb />
			a departure from the views of the Chief Justice of India, the Court can
			<lb />
			examine the issue in the light of the available facts. In such a &apos;sensitive
			<lb />
			subject&apos; the last word should be with the Chief Justice of India. On this
			<lb />
			interpretation, it becomes irrelevant who formally decides the issue. This is
			<lb />
			what was held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;In the light of the scheme of the Constitution we have already referred to,
			<lb />
			it is doubtful whether such an interpretation as to the personal satisfaction
			<lb />
			of the President is correct. We are of the view that the President means, for
			<lb />
			all practical purposes, the Minister or the Council of Ministers as the case
			<lb />
			may be, and his opinion, satisfaction or decision is constitutionally secured
			<lb />
			when his Ministers arrive at such opinion satisfaction or decision. The
			<lb />
			independence of the Judiciary, which is a cardinal principle of the
			<lb />
			Constitution and has been relied on to justify the deviation, is guarded by
			<lb />
			the relevant article making consultation with the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			obligatory. In all conceivable cases consultation with that highest dignitary
			<lb />
			of Indian justice will and should be accepted by the Government of India
			<lb />
			and the Court will have an opportunity to examine if any other extraneous
			<lb />
			circumstances have entered into the verdict of the Minister, if he departs
			<lb />
			from the counsel given by the Chief Justice of India. In practice the last
			<lb />
			word in such a sensitive subject must belong to the Chief Justice of India,
			<lb />
			the rejection of his advice being ordinarily regarded as prompted by
			<lb />
			oblique considerations vitiating the order. In this view it is immaterial
			<lb />
			whether the President or the Prime Minister or the Minister for Justice
			<lb />
			formally decides the issue.&quot; 335
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			144. This decision is important for three key reasons: (1) It recognized,
			<lb />
			judicially, the independence of the judiciary. (This was before the First
			<lb />
			Judges case which recognized that the independence of the judiciary was a
			<lb />
			basic feature of the Constitution). (2) It cleared the air by concluding that
			<lb />
			the President was obliged to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers,
			<lb />
			even on the issue of appointment of judges. This was &apos;formalized&apos; by the
			<lb />
			Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976. (3) In a sense, this
			<lb />
			decision was a precursor to the primacy conclusion in the Second Judges
			<lb />
			case with the last word on the subject being with the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			145. There are two observations that need to be made at this stage. Firstly,
			<lb />
			Justice Krishna Iyer penned the decision in Samsher Singh on behalf of
			<lb />
			Justice Bhagwati as well. Surprisingly, Justice Bhagwati did not refer to this
			<lb />
			decision in the First Judges case. The significance of this failure is that
			<lb />
			while in Samsher Singh it was held by Justice Bhagwati that the &apos;last word&apos;
			<lb />
			must belong to the Chief Justice of India, in the First Judges case it was
			<lb />
			held by Justice Bhagwati that the &apos;ultimate power&apos; is with the executive. This
			<lb />
			completely divergent view, though in different circumstances, is inexplicable
			<lb />
			since the underlying principle is the same, namely, the status of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India with reference to the affairs concerning the judiciary. The
			<lb />
			second observation is that the &apos;last word&apos; theory was not and has not been
			<lb />
			questioned by the executive in any case, even in the Second Judges case.
			<lb />
			Therefore, the &apos;last word&apos; principle having been accepted, there is now no
			<lb />
			reason to go back on it or to repudiate it. It may be mentioned in the &apos;last
			<lb />
			word&apos; context that ever since the Constitution came to be enacted, writes
			<lb />
			Granville Austin, quoting from Chief Justice Mehr Chand Mahajan&apos;s &apos;A
			<lb />
			Pillar of Justice&apos;:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Nehru &apos;has always acted in accordance with the advice of the CJI&apos;, he
			<lb />
			recalled, except in rare circumstances, despite efforts by state politicians
			<lb />
			with &apos;considerable pull&apos; to influence him.&quot;
		</item>
		<p>
			336
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Sankalchand Sheth&apos;s case
			<lb />
			146. Another decision of considerable significance is Union of India v.
			<lb />
			Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth. 337 That case pertained to the transfer of judges
			<lb />
			from one High Court to another and the interpretation of Article 222(1) of
			<lb />
			the Constitution. 338 Referring to the independence of the judiciary as also
			<lb />
			Article 50 of the Constitution it was said by Justice Y.V. Chandrachud:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Having envisaged that the judiciary, which ought to act as a bastion of the
			<lb />
			rights and freedom of the people, must be immune from the influence and
			<lb />
			interference of the executive, the Constituent Assembly gave to that
			<lb />
			concept a concrete form by making various provisions to secure and
			<lb />
			safeguard the independence of the judiciary. Article 50 of the Constitution,
			<lb />
			which contains a Directive Principle of State Policy, provides that the State
			<lb />
			shall take steps to separate the judiciary from the executive in the public
			<lb />
			services of the State.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

			336 Granville Austin: Working a Democratic Constitution page131
			<lb />
			337 (1977) 4 SCC 193 (Five Judges Bench)
			<lb />
			338 222. Transfer of a Judge from one High Court to another.-(1) The President may, after consultation
			<lb />
			with the Chief Justice of India, transfer a Judge from one High Court to any other High Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(2) When a Judge has been or is so transferred, he shall, during the period he serves, after the
			<lb />
			commencement of the Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 1963, as a Judge of the other High Court,
			<lb />
			be entitled to receive in addition to his salary such compensatory allowance as may be determined by
			<lb />
			Parliament by law and, until so determined, such compensatory allowance as the President may by order
			<lb />
			fix.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			147. On the meaning of consultation by the President with the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India in the context of Article 222 of the Constitution, it was held that it
			<lb />
			has to be full and effective consultation and not formal or unproductive. It
			<lb />
			was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Article 222(1) which requires the President to consult the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India is founded on the principle that in a matter which concerns the
			<lb />
			judiciary vitally, no decision ought to be taken by the executive without
			<lb />
			obtaining the views of the Chief Justice of India who, by training and
			<lb />
			experience, is in the best position to consider the situation fairly,
			<lb />
			competently and objectively. But there can be no purposeful consideration
			<lb />
			of a matter, in the absence of facts and circumstances on the basis of which
			<lb />
			alone the nature of the problem involved can be appreciated and the right
			<lb />
			decision taken. It must, therefore, follow that while consulting the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice, the President must make the relevant data available to him on the
			<lb />
			basis of which he can offer to the President the benefit of his considered
			<lb />
			opinion. If the facts necessary to arrive at a proper conclusion are not made
			<lb />
			available to the Chief Justice, he must ask for them because, in casting on
			<lb />
			the President the obligation to consult the Chief Justice, the Constitution at
			<lb />
			the same time must be taken to have imposed a duty on the Chief Justice to
			<lb />
			express his opinion on nothing less than a full consideration of the matter
			<lb />
			on which he is entitled to be consulted. The fulfilment by the President, of
			<lb />
			his constitutional obligation to place full facts before the Chief Justice and
			<lb />
			the performance by the latter, of the duty to elicit facts which are necessary
			<lb />
			to arrive at a proper conclusion are parts of the same process and are
			<lb />
			complementary to each other. The faithful observance of these may well
			<lb />
			earn a handsome dividend useful to the administration of justice.
			<lb />
			Consultation within the meaning of Article 222(1), therefore, means full
			<lb />
			and effective, not formal or unproductive, consultation.&quot; 339
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			148. It was observed that though &apos;consultation&apos; did not mean &apos;concurrence&apos;
			<lb />
			yet, as held in Samsher Singh consultation with the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			should be accepted and in such a sensitive subject the last word must belong
			<lb />
			to the Chief Justice of India. It was noted that if there is a departure from the
			<lb />
			counsel of the Chief Justice of India, the Court would have the opportunity
			<lb />
			to examine if any extraneous considerations entered into the decision. 340
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			149. This view was reiterated by Justice Krishna Iyer (for himself and
			<lb />
			Justice Fazl Ali). 341 Significantly, it was added that: &apos;It seems to us that the
			<lb />
			word, &apos;consultation&apos; has been used in Article 222 as a matter of constitutional
			<lb />
			courtesy in view of the fact that two very high dignitaries are concerned in
			<lb />
			the matter, namely, the President and the Chief Justice of India.&apos; 342
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			150. The greater significance of Sankalchand Sheth lies in the conclusion,
			<lb />
			relying upon R. Pushpam, that for a meaningful consultation, both parties
			<lb />
			must have for consideration full and identical facts. It was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The word &apos;consult&apos; implies a conference of two or more persons or an
			<lb />
			impact of two or more minds in respect of a topic in order to enable them
			<lb />
			to evolve a correct, or at least, a satisfactory solution&quot;. In order that the
			<lb />
			two minds may be able to confer and produce a mutual impact, it is
			<lb />
			essential that each must have for its consideration full and identical facts,
			<lb />
			which can at once constitute both the source and foundation of the final
			<lb />
			decision.&quot; 343
			<lb />

			Bhagwati, 344 Justice Fazal Ali, 345 Justice V.D. Tulzapurkar 346 and Justice D.A.

			<lb />
			Memorandum of Procedure -30.6.1999
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			152. Following up on the decision and opinion rendered in the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case and the Third Judges case, the Minister for Law in the
			<lb />
			Government of India framed and prepared one Memorandum of Procedure
			<lb />
			341 Paragraph 115
			<lb />
			342 Paragraph 115
			<lb />
			343 Paragraph 39
			<lb />
			344 Paragraph 30

			<lb />
			for the appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court and another for the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge of the High Court. These were shared with the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India. None of the each successive Chief Justices of India have
			<lb />
			complained or criticized any of the Memoranda or adversely commented on
			<lb />
			them, or at least we have not been told of any such complaint or objection.
			<lb />
			No one, including any successive Law Minister of the Government of India,
			<lb />
			complained that the Memoranda were unworkable or caused any hindrance
			<lb />
			or delay in the appointment of judges or did not correctly reflect the views of
			<lb />
			this Court in the two decisions mentioned above or that they did not conform
			<lb />
			to any provision of the Constitution, either in letter or in spirit or even
			<lb />
			otherwise, or at least we have not been told of any such constraint. These
			<lb />
			Memoranda remained operational and the appointment of judges to the
			<lb />
			superior judiciary made subsequent thereto has been in conformity with
			<lb />
			them. No one complained about the inability to effectively work any
			<lb />
			Memorandum of Procedure.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			153. We were invited by Mr. Fali S. Nariman to mention the procedure for
			<lb />
			the appointment of judges both in public interest and for reasons of
			<lb />
			transparency. The Memorandum of Procedure for the appointment of judges
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court and the High Court are available on the website of the
			<lb />
			Department of Justice of the Government of India 349 and therefore it is not
			<lb />
			necessary to make a detailed mention of the procedure. Similar Memoranda
			<lb />
			have been referred to in the Second Judges case by Justice Pandian. 350
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			154. A reading of the Memoranda makes it explicit that a proposal
			<lb />
			recommending the appointment of a judge of a High Court shall be initiated
			<lb />
			by the Chief Justice of the High Court. However, if the Chief Minister
			<lb />
			desires to recommend the name of any person he should forward the same to
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice for his consideration. Although it is not clearly spelt out, it
			<lb />
			is implicit that the Chief Justice is not obliged to accept the suggestion of the
			<lb />
			Chief Minister.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			155. It is also significant and important to note that in the Memoranda,
			<lb />
			consultation by the judges in the collegium with &apos;non-judges&apos; for making an
			<lb />
			appointment to the Supreme Court is postulated and it is not prohibited for
			<lb />
			making an appointment to the High Court. That is to say, a &apos;collegium judge&apos;
			<lb />
			is not prohibited from taking the opinion of any person, either connected
			<lb />
			with the legal profession or otherwise for taking an informed decision
			<lb />
			regarding the suitability or otherwise of a person for appointment as a judge
			<lb />
			of the High Court or the Supreme Court. That this is not unknown is clear
			<lb />
			from a categorical statement of Justice Verma in an interview that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;For every Supreme Court appointment, I consulted senior lawyers like
			<lb />
			Fali S. Nariman and Shanthi Bhushan. I used to consult five or six top
			<lb />
			lawyers. I used to consult even lawyers belonging to the middle level.
			<lb />
			Similar consultation took place in the case of High Courts. I recorded
			<lb />
			details of every consultation. I wish all my correspondence is made
			<lb />
			public.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			156. Therefore, during the evolution of the system of appointment of judges
			<lb />
			four cobwebs were cleared. They were: (1) The role of the President -he/she
			<lb />
			was expected to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers even in the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges; (2) The initial recommendation for the appointment
			<lb />
			of a judge of a High Court was to originate from the Chief Justice of the
			<lb />
			High Court and for the appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court from
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India; (3) Consultation between the President and the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India is an integrated participative process with the result
			<lb />
			that the President has the final say in the appointment of a judge under
			<lb />
			certain circumstances and the Chief Justice of India (in consultation with and
			<lb />
			on the unanimous view of the other judges consulted by him/her) has the
			<lb />
			final say under certain circumstances; and (4) The Union of India accepted
			<lb />
			these propositions without hesitation in the Third Judges case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Amendments to the Constitution
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			157. Apart from judicial discourses on the appointment of judges,
			<lb />
			Parliament too has had its share of discussions. On as many as four
			<lb />
			occasions, it was proposed to amend the Constitution in relation to the
			<lb />
			procedure for the appointment of judges of the Supreme Court and the
			<lb />
			High Courts. These proposed amendments are considered below.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) The Constitution (Sixty-seventh Amendment) Bill, 1990
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			158. The Constitution (Sixty-seventh Amendment) Bill, 1990 was
			<lb />
			introduced in the Lok Sabha on 18 th May, 1990 and it proposed to set up a
			<lb />
			National Judicial Commission (for short the NJC), though not in line with
			<lb />
			the recommendations of the LCI. The composition of the NJC was to vary
			<lb />
			with the subject matter of concern, namely, the appointment of a judge of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court or the appointment of a judge of the High Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			159. For the appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court, in terms of the
			<lb />
			proposed Article 307A of the Constitution, the NJC was to consist of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India and two other judges of the Supreme Court next in
			<lb />
			seniority to the Chief Justice of India. For the appointment of a judge of the
			<lb />
			High Court, the NJC was to consist of the Chief Justice of India, the Chief
			<lb />
			Minister or Governor (as the case may be) of the concerned State, one other
			<lb />
			judge of the Supreme Court next in seniority to the Chief Justice of India, the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of the High Court and the judge of the High Court next in
			<lb />
			seniority to the Chief Justice of the High Court. There was no provision for
			<lb />
			the appointment of the Chief Justice of India or the Chief Justice of the High
			<lb />
			Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			160. The procedure for the transaction of business of the NJC was to be
			<lb />
			determined by the President in consultation with the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			and was subject to any law made by Parliament.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			161. The Amendment Act also provided that in the event the
			<lb />
			recommendation of the NJC is not accepted, the reasons therefor shall be
			<lb />
			recorded in writing.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			162. The Bill was criticized (in part) by the Arrears Committee which
			<lb />
			stated that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The Committee is unable to find any logic or justification for different
			<lb />
			commissions….Keeping in view the objects and reasons for the
			<lb />
			constitution of the commission, namely, to obviate the criticism of
			<lb />
			executive arbitrariness in the matter of appointment and transfer of High
			<lb />
			Court judges and to prevent delay in making appointments, there is no
			<lb />
			justification for the executive through the Chief Minister to be on the
			<lb />
			commission. Instead of removing the vice of executive interference which
			<lb />
			has vitiated the working of the present system the presence of the Chief
			<lb />
			Minister on the recommendatory body actual alleviates him from the status
			<lb />
			of a mere consultee to the position of an equal participant in the selection
			<lb />
			process of the recommendatory body. By making the Chief Minister an
			<lb />
			equal party when he is not equipped to offer any view in regard to the
			<lb />
			merit, ability, competency, integrity and suitability of the candidates for
			<lb />
			appointments, the scope of executive interference is enhanced.&quot; 351
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			163. The Bill was not taken up for consideration due to the dissolution of
			<lb />
			the Lok Sabha in May, 1991.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) The Constitution (Ninety-eighth Amendment) Bill, 2003
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			164. On 22 nd February, 2000 -barely 8 months after the issuance of the
			<lb />
			(Revised) Memorandum of Procedure mentioned above -the Government of
			<lb />
			India issued a notification setting up a National Commission to Review the
			<lb />
			Working of the Constitution (for short the NCRWC), including the
			<lb />
			procedure for the appointment of judges of the superior judiciary. The terms
			<lb />
			of reference of the NCRWC were as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The Commission shall examine, in the light of the experience of the past
			<lb />
			50 years, as to how best the Constitution can respond to the changing needs
			<lb />
			of efficient, smooth and effective system of governance and
			<lb />
			socio-economic development of modern India within the framework of
			<lb />
			parliamentary democracy and to recommend changes, if any, that are
			<lb />
			required in the provisions of the Constitution without interfering with its
			<lb />
			basic structure or features.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			165. On 26 th September, 2001 an Advisory Panel of the NCRWC issued a
			<lb />
			Consultation Paper on Superior Judiciary. 352 This Paper dealt with the
			<lb />
			procedure for appointment of judges of the Supreme Court and the High
			<lb />
			Courts, the age of retirement of judges, the transfer of judges of the High
			<lb />
			Courts and the procedure for dealing with &apos;deviant&apos; behavior of a judge and
			<lb />
			for his/her removal.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			166. In the context of appointment of judges of the superior judiciary,
			<lb />
			paragraph 8.20 of the Paper is significant since it tacitly acknowledges that
			<lb />
			the procedure evolved over the years particularly as a result of the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case and the Third Judges case was quite satisfactory. Paragraph
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			8.20 reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;8.20 Purpose of 67 th Amendment Bill served by the judgement in
			<lb />
			SCAORA: We have set out hereinabove the several methods of
			<lb />
			appointment (to Supreme Court and High Courts) suggested by the various
			<lb />
			bodies, committees and organizations. We have also set out the method
			<lb />
			and procedure of appointment devised by the 1993 decision of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in SCAORA 353 and in the 1998 opinion rendered under Article
		</item>
		<p>
			143.
			<lb />
			It would be evident therefrom that the 1993 decision gives effect to the
			<lb />
			substance of the Constitution (Sixty-seventh Amendment) Bill, without of
			<lb />
			course calling it a &apos;National Judicial Commission&apos;, and without the
			<lb />
			necessity of amending the Constitution as suggested by the said
			<lb />
			Amendment Bill. Indeed, it carries forward the object underlying the
			<lb />
			Amendment Bill by making the recommendations of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India and his colleagues binding on the President. The 1998 opinion
			<lb />
			indeed enlarges the &apos;collegium&apos;. In this sense, the purpose of the said
			<lb />
			Amendment Bill evidenced by the proviso to Article 124(2) and the
			<lb />
			Explanation appended thereto, is served, speaking broadly. The method of
			<lb />
			appointment evolved by these decisions has indeed been hailed by several
			<lb />
			jurists and is held out as a precedent worthy of emulation by U.K. and
			<lb />
			others. (See the opinion of Lord Templeman, a member of the House of
			<lb />
			Lords, cited hereinabove.) The said decisions lay down the proposition
			<lb />
			that the &quot;consultation&quot; contemplated by Articles 124 and 217 should be a
			<lb />
			real and effective consultation and that having regard to the concept of
			<lb />
			Judicial independence, which is a basic feature of the Constitution, the
			<lb />
			opinion rendered by the Chief Justice of India (after consulting his
			<lb />
			colleagues) shall be binding upon the Executive. In this view of the matter,
			<lb />
			much of the expectations from a National Judicial Commission (N.J.C)
			<lb />
			have been met. The said Constitution Amendment Bill was, it would
			<lb />
			appear, prepared after a wide and elaborate consultation with all the
			<lb />
			political parties and other stakeholders. However, the aspect of
			<lb />
			disciplinary jurisdiction remains unanswered. We may however discuss
			<lb />
			the concept of an N.J.C. which may cover both appointments and matters
			<lb />
			of discipline.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			167. The Paper acknowledged that the Second Judges case and the Third
			<lb />
			Judges case &apos;speaking broadly&apos; served the purpose of the Constitution
			<lb />
			(Sixty-seventh Amendment) Bill and that &apos;much of the expectations from a
			<lb />
			National Judicial Commission (N.J.C) have been met.&apos; The shortfalls in
			<lb />
			expectations were not specified in the Paper except that of the disciplinary
			<lb />
			jurisdiction which did not arise and was not dealt with in the Second Judges
			<lb />
			case or the Third Judges case. However, it is important to note that a
			<lb />
			dispassionate jurist Lord Templeman, a member of the House of Lords held
			<lb />
			the view that the system of appointment of judges in India ought to be
			<lb />
			followed in England as well. Apart from him, the system of appointment of
			<lb />
			judges laid down by these decisions &apos;has been hailed by several jurists and is
			<lb />
			held out as a precedent worthy of emulation&apos;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			168. Be that as it may, the NCRWC submitted its Report to the Prime
			<lb />
			Minister on 31 st March, 2002. In Chapter 7 of the Report relating to the
			<lb />
			judiciary, the NCRWC recommended in paragraph 7.3.7 thereof the
			<lb />
			establishment of a National Judicial Commission (for short the NJC). It was
			<lb />
			observed that such a commission was necessary for &apos;the effective
			<lb />
			participation of both the executive and the judicial wings of the State as an
			<lb />
			integrated scheme for the machinery for appointment of judges&apos; in line with
			<lb />
			the integrated participatory consultative process suggested by this Court in
			<lb />
			the Second Judges case and the Third Judges case. This is what the
			<lb />
			NCRWC had to say:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The matter relating to manner of appointment of judges had been debated
			<lb />
			over a decade. The Constitution (Sixty-seventh Amendment) Bill, 1990
			<lb />
			was introduced on 18 th May, 1990 (9 th Lok Sabha) providing for the
			<lb />
			institutional frame work of National Judicial Commission for
			<lb />
			recommending the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court and the
			<lb />
			various High Courts. Further, it appears that latterly there is a movement
			<lb />
			throughout the world to move this function away from the exclusive fiat of
			<lb />
			the executive and involving some institutional frame work whereunder
			<lb />
			consultation with the judiciary at some level is provided for before making
			<lb />
			such appointments. The system of consultation in some form is already
			<lb />
			available in Japan, Israel and the UK. The Constitution (Sixty-seventh
			<lb />
			Amendment) Bill, 1990 provided for a collegium of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India and two other judges of the Supreme Court for making appointment
			<lb />
			to the Supreme Court. However, it would be worthwhile to have a
			<lb />
			participatory mode with the participation of both the executive and the
			<lb />
			judiciary in making such recommendations. The Commission proposes the
			<lb />
			composition of the Collegium which gives due importance to and provides
			<lb />
			for the effective participation of both the executive and the judicial wings
			<lb />
			of the State as an integrated scheme for the machinery for appointment of
			<lb />
			judges. This Commission, accordingly, recommends the establishment of a
			<lb />
			National Judicial Commission under the Constitution.
			<lb />
			The National Judicial Commission for appointment of judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court shall comprise of:
			<lb />
			The Chief Justice of India:
			<lb />
			Chairman
			<lb />
			Two senior most judges of the Supreme Court: Member
			<lb />
			The Union Minister for Law and Justice:
			<lb />
			Member
			<lb />
			One eminent person nominated by the President after consulting the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India:
			<lb />
			Member
			<lb />
			The recommendation for the establishment of a National Judicial
			<lb />
			Commission and its composition are to be treated as integral in view of the
			<lb />
			need to preserve the independence of the judiciary.&quot; 354
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			169. Pursuant to the recommendations of the NCRWC, the Constitution
			<lb />
			(Ninety-eighth Amendment) Bill, 2003 was introduced in Parliament on or
			<lb />
			about 8 th May, 2003. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Bill
			<lb />
			states, inter alia, that the Government of India has been committed to the
			<lb />
			setting up of an NJC for appointment of judges of the Supreme Court, Chief
			<lb />
			Justices and Judges of the High Courts as well as their transfer so as to
			<lb />
			provide for the effective participation of both the executive and the judicial
			<lb />
			wings of the Government. It is mentioned that the NCRWC also considered
			<lb />
			this matter and recommended the establishment of an NJC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			170. The Statement of Objects and Reasons refers to the composition of the
			<lb />
			NJC and while the NCRWC had recommended the nomination in the NJC of
			<lb />
			one eminent person by the President of India after consulting the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, the Constitution (Ninety-Eighth Amendment) Bill modified
			<lb />
			this recommendation and proposed that one eminent citizen be nominated by
			<lb />
			the President of India in consultation with the Prime Minister of India for a
			<lb />
			period of three years.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			171. The Constitution (Ninety-eighth Amendment) Bill proposed the
			<lb />
			insertion of Chapter IVA in the Constitution consisting of one Article namely
			<lb />
			Article 147A. This Article related to the establishment of the NJC in terms
			<lb />
			of the Statement of Objects and Reasons.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			172. The Bill was not passed in any House of Parliament due to the
			<lb />
			dissolution of the Lok Sabha in March 2004 and the general elections being
			<lb />
			called.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(c) The Constitution (One Hundred and Twentieth Amendment) Bill,
			<lb />
			2013
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			173. A third attempt was made to amend the Constitution for the purposes
			<lb />
			of appointment of judges of the superior judiciary. This was by the
			<lb />
			introduction of the Constitution (One Hundred and Twentieth Amendment)
			<lb />
			Bill, 2013 introduced in the Rajya Sabha on 24 th August 2013.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			174. The Statement of Objects and Reasons to the Bill referred to the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case and the Third Judges case as well as the Memorandum
			<lb />
			of Procedure. It was mentioned that the Memorandum confers upon the
			<lb />
			judiciary itself the power of appointment of judges of the superior
			<lb />
			judiciary. 355 It was further stated that after a review of the pronouncements
			<lb />
			of this Court and relevant constitutional provisions, a broad based judicial
			<lb />
			appointment commission could be established for making recommendations
			<lb />
			for the selection of judges. This commission would provide a meaningful
			<lb />
			role to the executive and the judiciary to present their viewpoint and make
			<lb />
			the participants accountable while introducing transparency in the selection
			<lb />
			process. The Statement of Objects and Reasons also mentioned that the
			<lb />
			proposed Bill would enable equal participation of the judiciary and the
			<lb />
			executive in the appointment of judges to the superior judiciary and also
			<lb />
			make the system more accountable and thereby increase the confidence of
			<lb />
			the public in the judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			175. The Constitution (One Hundred and Twentieth Amendment) Bill
			<lb />
			proposed the insertion of Article 124A in the Constitution establishing a
			<lb />
			commission known as the National Judicial Appointments Commission (for
			<lb />
			short the NJAC). The composition of the NJAC, the appointment of its
			<lb />
			Chairperson and Members, their qualifications, conditions of services,
			<lb />
			tenure, functions and the procedure as well as the manner of selection of
			<lb />
			persons for appointment as Chief Justice of India, judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court, Chief Justices and other judges of the High Courts was to be provided
			<lb />
			by law made by Parliament.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			176. The Constitution (One Hundred and Twentieth Amendment) Bill was
			<lb />
			passed by the Rajya Sabha on 5 th September 2013 but the Lok Sabha was
			<lb />
			dissolved in May 2014 before the Bill could be sent to it and the general
			<lb />
			elections called.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			177. Strangely, the Statement of Objects and Reasons completely
			<lb />
			overlooked the fact that there already was &apos;equal participation of the
			<lb />
			judiciary and the executive in the appointment of judges to the superior
			<lb />
			judiciary.&apos; In the Second Judges case it was clearly, explicitly and
			<lb />
			unequivocally stated that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The process of appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court and the High
			<lb />
			Courts is an integrated &apos;participatory consultative process&apos; for selecting the
			<lb />
			best and most suitable persons available for appointment; and all the
			<lb />
			constitutional functionaries must perform this duty collectively with a view
			<lb />
			primarily to reach an agreed decision, subserving the constitutional
			<lb />
			purpose, so that the occasion of primacy does not arise.&quot; 356
			<lb />
			However, in the event of a difference of opinion, one of the constitutional
			<lb />
			authorities must have the final say and given the constitutional convention
			<lb />
			over the decades the final say ought to be with the Chief Justice of India, the
			<lb />
			head of the judiciary in India under certain circumstances and with the
			<lb />
			President under certain circumstances. Otherwise, a stalemate or deadlock
			<lb />
			situation could arise which the Constituent Assembly obviously did not
			<lb />
			anticipate from two constitutional functionaries. The Second Judges case
			<lb />
			and the Third Judges case gave this shared responsibility to the President
			<lb />
			and the Chief Justice of India. 357 For the appointment of a judge of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court, the collegium of 5 (five) judges must make a unanimous
			<lb />
			recommendation. The President is entitled to turn down a 4-1 or 3-2
			<lb />
			recommendation. If the unanimous recommendation does not find favour
			<lb />
			with the President for strong and cogent reasons and is returned to the
			<lb />
			collegium for reconsideration, and it is unanimously reiterated, then the
			<lb />
			President is obliged to accept the recommendation. However, if the
			<lb />
			reiteration is not unanimous, then the President is entitled to turn down the
			<lb />
			recommendation. The theory which the Constitution (One Hundred and
			<lb />
			Twentieth Amendment) Bill, 2013 [and subsequently the Constitution (One
			<lb />
			Hundred and Twenty-first Amendment) Bill, 2014] sought to demolish that
			<lb />
			&apos;judges appoint judges&apos; is non-existent.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(d) The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-first Amendment) Bill,
			<lb />
			2014
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			178. The fourth and final attempt (presently successful and under challenge
			<lb />
			in these petitions) to amend the Constitution was by the introduction on 11 th
			<lb />
			357 I am somewhat uncomfortable with the word &apos;primacy&apos; while dealing with the President and the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India. In the context of the appointment of judges, the word &apos;responsibility&apos; used by the LCI in its
			<lb />
			14 th Report seems more appropriate.
			<lb />

			<lb />
			August, 2014 of the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-first
			<lb />
			Amendment) Bill, 2014. This Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on 13 th
			<lb />
			August, 2014 and by the Rajya Sabha on 14 th August, 2014. It received the
			<lb />
			ratification of more than one half of the States as required by Article 368(2)
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Act 2014.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			179. It may be mentioned en passant that the learned Solicitor General was
			<lb />
			requested to place on record the procedure adopted by the State Legislatures
			<lb />
			for ratification of the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-first
			<lb />
			Amendment) Bill, 2014 but that information was not forthcoming, for
			<lb />
			reasons that are not known. The intention was not to question the factum of
			<lb />
			ratification but only to understand the process and to add transparency to the
			<lb />
			process, since there have been instances in the United States where the courts
			<lb />
			have examined the issue of the ratification of an amendment to the
			<lb />
			Constitution. 358 Transparency is not a one-way street.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			180. Section 1(2) of the Constitution (Ninety-ninth Amendment) Act 2014
			<lb />
			provides that it shall come into force on such date as the Central Government
			<lb />
			may by notification in the official gazette, appoint. The appointed date is

			Twenty-First Amendment) Bill, Parliament also considered the National
			<lb />
			Judicial Appointment Commission Bill, 2014. The Bill was introduced in

			Parliament on 11 th August, 2014. It was passed by the Lok Sabha on 13th
			<lb />
			August, 2014 and by the Rajya Sabha on 14 th August, 2014. The National
			<lb />
			Judicial Appointments Commission Act also received the assent of the
			<lb />
			President on 31 st December, 2014 and it was brought into force by a gazette
			<lb />
			notification issued on 13 th April, 2015.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			182. Both the Constitution (Ninety-ninth Amendment) Act, 2014 and the

			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Conclusions on the factual background
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			183. The conclusions that can be drawn from the background historical
			<lb />
			facts are as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(1) The independence of the judiciary has been always recognized and
			<lb />
			acknowledged by all concerned.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(2) Prior to Independence, the appointment of a judge to a superior
			<lb />
			court was entirely the discretion of the Crown. The Constituent Assembly
			<lb />
			felt that such a &apos;supreme and absolute&apos; power should not vest in the President
			<lb />
			or the government of the day or the Chief Justice of India (as an individual)
			<lb />
			and therefore a fetter was placed on that power by requiring the President to
			<lb />
			mandatorily consult the Chief Justice of India (with the discretion to consult
			<lb />
			other judges) for the appointment of a judge to the Supreme Court. For the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge of the High Court also, consultation with the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India was mandatory. In addition, consultation with the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of the High Court and the Governor of the State was mandatory.
			<lb />
			Significantly, there is no mention of consultation with anybody from civil
			<lb />
			society.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(3) Any doubt about the individual role of the President in the process
			<lb />
			of appointment of judges came to rest and it was clear that the President was
			<lb />
			expected to act only on the advice of the Council of Ministers.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(4) Similarly, the Chief Justice of India is not expected to act in an
			<lb />
			individual or personal capacity but must consult his/her senior judges before
			<lb />
			making a recommendation for the appointment of a judge.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(5) Dr. Ambedkar and the Constituent Assembly did not accept the
			<lb />
			&apos;unfettered discretion&apos; theory in the CAD but this view was subsequently
			<lb />
			rejected in the First Judges case which brought in the &apos;ultimate power&apos;
			<lb />
			theory propounded by Justice Bhagwati and Justice Desai.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(6) Executive interference in the appointment process (with perhaps an
			<lb />
			informal method of &apos;take over&apos;) had started around the time of Independence
			<lb />
			and got aggravated post Independence, peaking towards the end of the
			<lb />
			1980s.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(7) Not a single instance was given to us where the President
			<lb />
			recommended a person for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court or
			<lb />
			the High Court. The Chief Minister of a State might have made a
			<lb />
			recommendation (although no instance was given to us) but that was
			<lb />
			required to be routed through the Chief Justice of the High Court, as per the
			<lb />
			Memorandum of Procedure.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(8) Only one instance was given to us, pre the First Judges case
			<lb />
			where an appointment as a judge of the High Court was made without the
			<lb />
			concurrence of the Chief Justice of India. Post the First Judges case as many
			<lb />
			as seven such appointments were made. This is a clear indication that the
			<lb />
			&apos;ultimate power&apos; theory propounded in the First Judges case translated into
			<lb />
			&apos;absolute executive primacy&apos;. The dream of Dr. Ambedkar became a
			<lb />
			nightmare, thanks to the political executive.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(9) The &apos;ultimate power&apos; theory or the &apos;absolute executive primacy&apos;
			<lb />
			theory is now diluted and the last word in the appointment of a judge of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court is shared between the President and the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			in terms of the Second Judges case and the Third Judges case. Historically,
			<lb />
			giving the last word to the executive has been criticized by no less than the
			<lb />
			Attorney-General Shri M.C. Setalvad who chaired the Law Commission of
			<lb />
			India when the 14 th Report was given. That system has not worked well at all
			<lb />
			as noted from time to time.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(10) The National Commission to Review the Working of the
			<lb />
			Constitution as well as a responsible judge from the House of Lords were of
			<lb />
			the opinion that the procedure for appointment of judges as laid down in the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case and the Third Judges case broadly serves the purpose
			<lb />
			of maintaining the independence of the judiciary and providing a suitable
			<lb />
			method for appointment of judges of the superior Courts.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			184. This is not to say that the &apos;collegium system&apos; is perfect. Hardly so.
			<lb />
			During the course of hearing, some critical comments were made with regard
			<lb />
			to the appointment of some judges to this Court which, it was submitted by
			<lb />
			the learned Attorney-General would not have been possible were it not for
			<lb />
			the failure of the collegium system. Even the petitioners were critical of the
			<lb />
			collegium system. However, I must express my anguish at the manner in
			<lb />
			which an &apos;attack&apos; was launched by some learned counsel appearing for the
			<lb />
			respondents. It was vitriolic at times, lacking discretion and wholly
			<lb />
			unnecessary. Denigrating judges is the easiest thing to do -they cannot fight
			<lb />
			back -and the surest way to ensure that the judiciary loses its independence
			<lb />
			and the people lose confidence in the judiciary, which is hardly advisable.
			<lb />
			The Bar has an equal (if not greater) stake in the independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary and the silence of the Bar at relevant moments is inexplicable. The
			<lb />
			solution, in the larger canvas, is a democratic audit, an audit limited to the
			<lb />
			judiciary and the Rule of Law. If some positive developments can be
			<lb />
			incorporated in the justice delivery system (in the larger context) they should
			<lb />
			be so incorporated.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			185. In this context, it is interesting to recall the words of Dr. Ambedkar on
			<lb />
			the working of the Constitution:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&apos;… however good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because
			<lb />
			those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot. However bad a
			<lb />
			Constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to
			<lb />
			work it, happen to be a good lot. The working of a Constitution does not
			<lb />
			depend wholly upon the nature of the Constitution.&quot; 359
			<lb />
			186. Both the &apos;absolute executive primacy&apos; system or the &apos;ultimate power&apos;
			<lb />
			theory and the &apos;collegium system&apos; of appointment of judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court and the High Courts were acceptable systems in their time. The
			<lb />
			&apos;executive primacy&apos; system was, unfortunately, abused by the executive and
			<lb />
			the judiciary could do precious little about it, bound as the judges are by the
			<lb />
			Rule of Law. It is because of this abuse that the constitutional provisions
			<lb />
			were revisited at the instance of the Bar of this Court and the revisit gave the
			<lb />
			correct interpretational insight into our constitutional history and the
			<lb />
			constitutional provisions. It is this insight that resulted in the Second Judges
			<lb />
			case and a meaningful and pragmatic interpretation of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			187. That the Second Judges case was correctly decided by the majority
			<lb />
			was accepted in the Third Judges case by the Attorney-General and, what is
			<lb />
			more important, by the President (aided and advised by the Council of
			<lb />
			Ministers) who did not seek a reversal of the dicta laid down in the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			188. To say, as was conveyed to us during the hearing of the case, that the
			<lb />
			collegium system has failed and that it needs replacement would not be a
			<lb />
			correct or a fair post mortem. It is true that there has been criticism
			<lb />
			(sometimes scathing) of the decisions of the collegium, but it must not be
			<lb />
			forgotten that the executive had an equally important participative role in the
			<lb />
			integrated process of the appointment of judges. That the executive adopted
			<lb />
			a defeatist or an I-don&apos;t-care attitude is most unfortunate. The collegium
			<lb />
			cannot be blamed for all the ills in the appointment of judges -the political
			<lb />
			executive has to share the blame equally if not more, since it mortgaged its
			<lb />
			constitutional responsibility of maintaining a check on what may be
			<lb />
			described as the erroneous decisions of the collegium.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			189. To say that the executive had no role to play (as was suggested to us)
			<lb />
			is incorrect to say the least, as is clear from a close reading of the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case and the Third Judges case. Even the President did not think so.
			<lb />
			In fact, the President was clearly of the opinion that the executive or at least
			<lb />
			the Head of State had a role to play in the appointment of judges. This
			<lb />
			evident from an article titled &quot;Merit&quot; in the Appointment of Judges&apos; 360 which
			<lb />
			quotes from an issue of India Today magazine of 25 th January, 1999 the
			<lb />
			following noting made by the President concerning the appointment of
			<lb />
			judges of the Supreme Court:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;I would like to record my views that while recommending the
			<lb />
			appointment of Supreme Court judges, it would be consonant with
			<lb />
			constitutional principles and the nation&apos;s social objectives if persons
			<lb />
			belonging to weaker sections of society like SCs and STs, who comprise
			<lb />
			25 per cent of the population, and women are given due consideration.
			<lb />
			Eligible persons from these categories are available and their
			<lb />
			under-representation or non-representation would not be justifiable.
			<lb />
			Keeping vacancies unfilled is also not desirable given the need for
			<lb />
			representation of different sections of society and the volume of work the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court is required to handle.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The Chief Justice of India is reported to have responded as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;I would like to assert that merit alone has been the criterion for selection
			<lb />
			of Judges and no discrimination has been done while making
			<lb />
			appointments. All eligible candidates, including those belonging to the
			<lb />
			Scheduled Castes and Tribes, are considered by us while recommending
			<lb />
			names for appointment as Supreme Court Judges. Our Constitution
			<lb />
			envisages that merit alone is the criterion for all appointments to the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court and High Courts. And we are scrupulously adhering to
			<lb />
			these provisions. An unfilled vacancy may not cause as much harm as a
			<lb />
			wrongly filled vacancy.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			190. All that was needed to keep the collegium system on the rails was the
			<lb />
			unstinted cooperation of the executive and an effective implementation
			<lb />
			strategy, with serious and meaningful introspection and perhaps some fine
			<lb />
			tuning and tweaking to make it more effective. Unfortunately, the executive
			<lb />
			did not respond positively, perhaps due to its misunderstanding of the
			<lb />
			decisions of this Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			191. On the other hand, an independent and impartial jurist, Lord
			<lb />
			Templeman praised the integrated consultative collegium system and
			<lb />
			recommended it as a method that the British could follow with advantage.
			<lb />
			The learned judge wrote:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;However, having regard to the earlier experience in India of attempts by
			<lb />
			the executive to influence the personalities and attitudes of members of the
			<lb />
			judiciary, and having regard to the successful attempts made in Pakistan to
			<lb />
			control the judiciary, and having regard to the unfortunate results of the
			<lb />
			appointment of Supreme Court judges of the United States by the President
			<lb />
			subject to approval by Congress, the majority decision of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court of India in the Advocates on Record case marks a welcome assertion
			<lb />
			of the independence of the judiciary and is the best method of obtaining
			<lb />
			appointments of integrity and quality, a precedent method which the
			<lb />
			British could follow with advantage.&quot; 361
			<lb />
			While others shower praise on our system of appointment of judges, we can
			<lb />
			only heap scorn!
			<lb />
			Preliminary issue -reconsideration of the Second Judges case and the
			<lb />
			Third Judges case
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			192. With this rather detailed history, the preliminary objections raised by
			<lb />
			the learned Attorney-General need consideration. The learned
			<lb />
			Attorney-General raised three preliminary issues: (1) The writ petitions are
			<lb />
			premature and not maintainable since the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act
			<lb />
			and the NJAC Act have not come into force; (2) The writ petitions are
			<lb />
			premature and not maintainable since the National Judicial Appointments
			<lb />
			Commission has not been constituted and so there is no adverse impact of
			<lb />
			the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC and no facts have been
			<lb />
			pleaded by the petitioners in this regard; (3) This batch of cases ought to be
			<lb />
			heard by a Bench of 9 (nine) or more judges since the decision of this Court
			<lb />
			in the Second Judges case 362 and the Third Judges case 363 do not lay down
			<lb />
			the correct law but require reconsideration. It was submitted that the
			<lb />
			decisions have the effect of usurping the powers of the President under
			<lb />
			Article 124(2) and Article 217(1) of the Constitution and that the judiciary
			<lb />
			has effectively converted the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			and the High Courts from &apos;consultation&apos; between the President and the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India (as occurring in Article 124(2) of the Constitution) into
			<lb />
			&apos;concurrence&apos; of the Chief Justice of India and giving birth to a &apos;right to
			<lb />
			insist&apos; on the acceptance of a recommendation of the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
			Moreover, the doctrine of separation of powers between the Legislature, the
			<lb />
			Executive and the Judiciary has been thrown overboard as also the system of
			<lb />
			checks and balances inherent in the Constitution. To decide this particular
			<lb />
			preliminary issue, the learned Attorney-General referred to the separation of
			<lb />
			powers in our Constitution, the law and the principles on which this Court
			<lb />
			should proceed to decide whether an earlier or prior decision rendered
			<lb />
			requires to be reconsidered.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			193. As far as the first preliminary objection is concerned, it was raised
			<lb />
			before the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act came into
			<lb />
			force. Now the preliminary objection does not survive since the 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act have in fact been brought
			<lb />
			into force. The second preliminary objection has no substance since the
			<lb />
			question in these petitions relates to the basic structure of the Constitution
			<lb />
			and the independence of the judiciary. It would be facetious to say that the
			<lb />
			writ petitions should have been filed after an adverse impact is felt by the
			<lb />
			alteration of the basic structure of the Constitution and after the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary is bartered away. If the petitioners were
			<lb />
			expected to wait that long it would perhaps be too late. That apart, since we
			<lb />
			have heard these petitions at length, it is advisable to pronounce on the
			<lb />
			substantive issues raised. Really speaking, it is only the third preliminary
			<lb />
			objection that needs consideration.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			The third preliminary objection and the separation of powers
			<lb />
			194. The issue of the separation of powers has been the subject matter of
			<lb />
			discussion in several cases. Broadly, the consistent view of this Court has
			<lb />
			been that while the Constitution recognizes the separation of powers, it is not
			<lb />
			a rigid separation and there is some overlap.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			195. In Ram Jawaya Kapur v. State of Punjab 364 it was held by Chief
			<lb />
			Justice Mukherjea speaking for this Court:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It may not be possible to frame an exhaustive definition of what executive
			<lb />
			function means and implies. Ordinarily the executive power connotes the
			<lb />
			residue of governmental functions that remain after legislative and judicial
			<lb />
			functions are taken away. The Indian Constitution has not indeed
			<lb />
			recognised the doctrine of separation of powers in its absolute rigidity but
			<lb />
			the functions of the different parts or branches of the Government have
			<lb />
			been sufficiently differentiated and consequently it can very well be said
			<lb />
			that our Constitution does not contemplate assumption, by one organ or
			<lb />
			part of the State, of functions that essentially belong to another. The
			<lb />
			executive indeed can exercise the powers of departmental or subordinate
			<lb />
			legislation when such powers are delegated to it by the legislature. It can
			<lb />
			also, when so empowered exercise judicial functions in a limited way. The
			<lb />
			executive Government, however, can never go against the provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution or of any law.&quot; 365
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			196. The separation of powers in our Constitution is not as rigid as in the
			<lb />
			United States. One of the elements of the separation of powers is the system
			<lb />
			of checks and balances. This too is recognized by our Constitution and
			<lb />
			Article 226 and Article 32 (judicial review) is one of the features of checks
			<lb />
			and balances. It was so held in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala 366
			<lb />
			where it was said by Justice Shelat and Justice Grover as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;There is ample evidence in the Constitution itself to indicate that it
			<lb />
			creates a system of checks and balances by reason of which powers are so
			<lb />
			distributed that none of the three organs it sets up can become so
			<lb />
			pre-dominant as to disable the others from exercising and discharging
			<lb />
			powers and functions entrusted to them. Though the Constitution does not
			<lb />
			lay down the principle of separation of powers in all its rigidity as is the
			<lb />
			case in the United States Constitution yet it envisages such a separation to
			<lb />
			a degree as was found in Ranasinghe case. 367 The judicial review provided
			<lb />
			expressly in our Constitution by means of Articles 226 and 32 is one of the
			<lb />
			features upon which hinges the system of checks and balances.&quot; 368
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			197. In Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain 369 the constitutional validity of
			<lb />
			the Constitution (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1975 was challenged. By
			<lb />
			this Amendment Act, Article 39-A was inserted in the Constitution and the
			<lb />
			challenge was, inter alia, to clause (4) thereof. 370 While striking down the
			<lb />
			offending clause, it was held by Justice H.R. Khanna:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;A declaration that an order made by a court of law is void is normally part
			<lb />
			of the judicial function and is not a legislative function. Although there is
			<lb />
			in the Constitution of India no rigid separation of powers, by and large the
			<lb />
			spheres of judicial function and legislative function have been demarcated
			<lb />
			and it is not permissible for the legislature to encroach upon the judicial
			<lb />
			sphere. It has accordingly been held that a legislature while it is entitled to
			<lb />
			change with retrospective effect the law which formed the basis of the
			<lb />
			judicial decision, it is not permissible to the legislature to declare the
			<lb />
			judgment of the court to be void or not binding (see Shri Prithvi Cotton
			<lb />
			Mills Ltd. v. Broach Borough Municipality, Janapada Sabha, Chhindwara
			<lb />
			v. Central Provinces Syndicate Ltd., Municipal Corporation of the City of
			<lb />
			Ahmedabad v. New Shorock Spg. &amp; Wvg. Co. Ltd. and State of Tamil Nadu
			<lb />
			v. M. Rayappa Gounder).&quot; 371 (Internal citations omitted).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			198. Justice Mathew held that ours is a cooperative federalism that does not
			<lb />
			contain any rigid separation of powers and there exists a system of checks
			<lb />
			and balances. Harold Laski was quoted as saying that &apos;Separation of powers
			<lb />
			367 1965 AC 172
			<lb />
			368 Paragraph 577
			<lb />
			369 1975 Supp SCC 1 (Five Judges Bench)
			<lb />
			370 (4) No law made by Parliament before the commencement of the Constitution (Thirty-ninth
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, 1975, insofar as it relates to election petitions and matters connected therewith shall
			<lb />
			apply or shall be deemed ever to have applied to or in relation to the election of any such person as is
			<lb />
			referred to in clause (1) to either House of Parliament and such election shall not be deemed to be void or
			<lb />
			ever to have become void on any ground on which such election could be declared to be void, or has, before
			<lb />
			such commencement, been declared to be void under any such law and notwithstanding any order made by
			<lb />
			any court, before such commencement, declaring such election to be void, such election shall continue to be
			<lb />
			valid in all respects and any such order and any finding on which such order is based shall be and shall be
			<lb />
			deemed always to have been void and of no effect.
			<lb />
			371 Paragraph 190
			<lb />
			Page 689
			<lb />
			does not mean the equal balance of powers.&apos; 372 In that context it was held
			<lb />
			that the exercise of judicial power by the Legislature is impermissible. The
			<lb />
			learned judge expressed the view that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Montesquieu was the first to conceive of the three functions of
			<lb />
			Government as exercised by three organs, each juxtaposed against others.
			<lb />
			He realised that the efficient operation of Government involved a certain
			<lb />
			degree of overlapping and that the theory of checks and balances required
			<lb />
			each organ to impede too great an aggrandizement of authority by the
			<lb />
			other two powers. As Holdsworth says, Montesquieu convinced the world
			<lb />
			that he had discovered a new constitutional principle which was
			<lb />
			universally valid. The doctrine of separation of governmental powers is not
			<lb />
			a mere theoretical, philosophical concept. It is a practical, work-a-day
			<lb />
			principle. The division of Government into three branches does not imply,
			<lb />
			as its critics would have us think, three watertight compartments. Thus,
			<lb />
			legislative impeachment of executive officers or judges, executive veto
			<lb />
			over legislation, judicial review of administrative or legislative actions are
			<lb />
			treated as partial exceptions which need explanation.&quot; 373
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			199. Justice Y.V. Chandrachud made a distinction between the separation of
			<lb />
			powers as understood in the United States and Australia and as understood in
			<lb />
			India and expressed the following view in this regard:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The American Constitution provides for a rigid separation of
			<lb />
			governmental powers into three basic divisions, the executive, legislative
			<lb />
			and judicial. It is an essential principle of that Constitution that powers
			<lb />
			entrusted to one department should not be exercised by any other
			<lb />
			department. The Australian Constitution follows the same pattern of
			<lb />
			distribution of powers. Unlike these Constitutions, the Indian Constitution
			<lb />
			does not expressly vest the three kinds of power in three different organs
			<lb />
			of the State. But the principle of separation of powers is not a magic
			<lb />
			formula for keeping the three organs of the State within the strict confines
			<lb />
			of their functions. As observed by Cardozo, J. in his dissenting opinion in
			<lb />
			Panama Refining Company v. Ryan 374 the principle of separation of powers
			<lb />
			&quot;is not a doctrinaire concept to be made use of with pedantic rigour. There
			<lb />
			must be sensible approximation, there must be elasticity of adjustment in
			<lb />
			response to the practical necessities of Government which cannot foresee
			<lb />
			today the developments of tomorrow in their nearly infinite variety&quot;. Thus,
			<lb />
			even in America, despite the theory that the legislature cannot delegate its
			<lb />
			power to the executive, a host of rules and regulations are passed by
			<lb />
			non-legislative bodies, which have been judicially recognized as valid.&quot; 375
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			200. In Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India 376 Justice Bhagwati opined
			<lb />
			that the Constitution has devised a structure for the separation of powers and
			<lb />
			checks and balances and held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It is clear from the majority decision in Kesavananda Bharati case that
			<lb />
			our Constitution is a controlled Constitution which confers powers on the
			<lb />
			various authorities created and recognised by it and defines the limits of
			<lb />
			those powers. The Constitution is suprema lex, the paramount law of the
			<lb />
			land and there is no authority, no department or branch of the State which
			<lb />
			is above or beyond the Constitution or has powers unfettered and
			<lb />
			unrestricted by the Constitution. The Constitution has devised a structure
			<lb />
			of power relationship with checks and balances and limits are placed on
			<lb />
			the powers of every authority or instrumentality under the Constitution.
			<lb />
			Every organ of the State, be it the executive or the legislature or the
			<lb />
			judiciary, derives its authority from the Constitution and it has to act within
			<lb />
			the limits of such authority.&quot; 377
			<lb />
			201. A little later, it was observed by the learned judge:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;It is a fundamental principle of our constitutional scheme, and I have
			<lb />
			pointed this out in the preceding paragraph, that every organ of the State,
			<lb />
			every authority under the Constitution, derives its power from the
			<lb />
			Constitution and has to act within the limits of such power. But then the
			<lb />
			question arises as to which authority must decide what are the limits on the
			<lb />
			power conferred upon each organ or instrumentality of the State and
			<lb />
			whether such limits are transgressed or exceeded. Now there are three
			<lb />
			main departments of the State amongst which the powers of government
			<lb />
			are divided; the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. Under our
			<lb />
			Constitution we have no rigid separation of powers as in the United States
			<lb />
			of America, but there is a broad demarcation, though, having regard to the
			<lb />
			complex nature of governmental functions, certain degree of overlapping
			<lb />
			is inevitable. The reason for this broad separation of powers is that &quot;the
			<lb />
			concentration of powers in any one organ may&quot; to quote the words of
			<lb />
			Chandrachud, J., (as he then was) in Indira Gandhi case &apos;by upsetting that
			<lb />
			fine balance between the three organs, destroy the fundamental premises of
			<lb />
			a democratic government to which we are pledged&apos;.&quot; 378
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			202. In I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu 379 it was held by Chief Justice
			<lb />
			Sabharwal speaking for the Court that the doctrine of separation of powers is
			<lb />
			a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. It was held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The separation of powers between Legislature, Executive and the
			<lb />
			Judiciary constitutes basic structure, has been found in Kesavananda
			<lb />
			Bharati case by the majority. Later, it was reiterated in Indira Gandhi
			<lb />
			case. A large number of judgments have reiterated that the separation of
			<lb />
			powers is one of the basic features of the Constitution.&quot; 380
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			203. In Bhim Singh v. Union of India 381 it was held that separation of
			<lb />
			powers is an essential feature of the Constitution and in modern governance
			<lb />
			strict separation is neither possible nor desirable. There is no violation of the
			<lb />
			principle of separation of powers if there is an overlap of the function of one
			<lb />
			branch of governance with another, but if one branch takes over an essential
			<lb />
			function of another branch, then there is a violation of the principle. It was
			<lb />
			observed by Justice Sathasivam speaking for the Court, while considering
			<lb />
			the constitutional validity of the Members of Parliament Local Area
			<lb />
			Development Scheme:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The concept of separation of powers, even though not found in any
			<lb />
			particular constitutional provision, is inherent in the polity the Constitution
			<lb />
			has adopted. The aim of separation of powers is to achieve the maximum
			<lb />
			extent of accountability of each branch of the Government.
			<lb />
			While understanding this concept [of separation of powers], two aspects
			<lb />
			must be borne in mind. One, that separation of powers is an essential
			<lb />
			feature of the Constitution. Two, that in modern governance, a strict
			<lb />
			separation is neither possible, nor desirable. Nevertheless, till this principle
			<lb />
			of accountability is preserved, there is no violation of separation of
			<lb />
			powers. We arrive at the same conclusion when we assess the position
			<lb />
			within the constitutional text. The Constitution does not prohibit overlap of
			<lb />
			functions, but in fact provides for some overlap as a parliamentary
			<lb />
			democracy. But what it prohibits is such exercise of function of the other
			<lb />
			branch which results in wresting away of the regime of constitutional
			<lb />
			accountability.
			<lb />
			Thus, the test for the violation of separation of powers must be precisely
			<lb />
			this. A law would be violative of separation of powers not if it results in
			<lb />
			some overlap of functions of different branches of the State, but if it takes
			<lb />
			over an essential function of the other branch leading to lapse in
			<lb />
			constitutional accountability.&quot; 382
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			204. Finally, in State of Tamil Nadu v. State of Kerala 383 there is an
			<lb />
			elaborate discussion on the separation of powers with reference to several
			<lb />
			cases decided by this Court. 384 It was held therein that in view of the doctrine
			<lb />
			of the separation of powers (and for other reasons as well) the Kerala
			<lb />
			Irrigation and Water Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2006 passed by the
			<lb />
			Kerala Legislature is unconstitutional since it seeks to nullify the decision of
			<lb />
			this Court in Mullaperiyar Environmental Protection Forum v. Union of
			<lb />
			India. 385
			<lb />
			205. The submission of the learned Attorney-General was that the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court or a High Court is an executive
			<lb />
			function and this has been so held even in the Second Judges case. Justice
			<lb />
			Ahmadi held that the appointment of judges is an executive function 386 as did
			<lb />
			Justice Verma. 387 By an unsustainable interpretation of the Constitution (an
			<lb />
			interpretation which, according to the learned Attorney-General must have
			<lb />
			made Dr. Ambedkar turn in his grave), this executive function has been taken
			<lb />
			over or usurped by the judiciary and that is the reason why the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case requires to be reconsidered and the correct constitutional
			<lb />
			position deserves to be restored. In other words, by a process of judicial
			<lb />
			encroachment, the separation of power theory has been broken down by this
			<lb />
			Court, in violation of the basic structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Constituent Assembly Debates and the third preliminary issue
			<lb />
			206. In further support of his contention that the Second Judges case and
			<lb />
			the Third Judges case do not lay down the correct law and need
			<lb />
			reconsideration, the learned Attorney-General placed great reliance on the
			<lb />
			CAD. It is necessary, therefore, to consider the law on the subject and then
			<lb />
			the debates.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			207. In Administrator-General of Bengal v. Prem Lal Mullick 388 the Privy
			<lb />
			Council did not approve of a reference to debates in the Legislature as a
			<lb />
			legitimate aid to the construction of a statute. It was held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Their Lordships observe that the two learned Judges who constituted the
			<lb />
			majority in the Appellate Court, although they do not base their judgment
			<lb />
			upon them, refer to the proceedings of the Legislature which resulted in the
			<lb />
			passing of the Act of 1874 [Administrator-General&apos;s Act] as legitimate aids
			<lb />
			to the construction of Section 31. Their Lordships think it right to express
			<lb />
			their dissent from that proposition. The same reasons which exclude these
			<lb />
			considerations when the clauses of an Act of the British Legislature are
			<lb />
			under construction are equally cogent in the case of an Indian statute.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			208. This view was partially accepted, with reference to the CAD in A.K.
			<lb />
			Gopalan v. State of Madras 389 by Chief Justice Harilal Kania who held that
			<lb />
			reference may be made to the CAD with great caution and only when &apos;latent
			<lb />
			ambiguities are to be resolved.&apos; 390 The learned Chief Justice observed:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Our attention was drawn to the debates and report of the drafting
			<lb />
			committee of the Constituent Assembly in respect of the wording of this
			<lb />
			clause. The report may be read not to control the meaning of the article,
			<lb />
			but may be seen in case of ambiguity. In Municipal Council of Sydney v.
			<lb />
			The Commonwealth 391 it was thought that individual opinion of members
			<lb />
			of the Convention expressed in the debate cannot be referred to for the
			<lb />
			purpose of construing the Constitution. The same opinion was expressed in
			<lb />
			United States v. Wong Kim Ark. 392 The result appears to be that while it is
			<lb />
			not proper to take into consideration the individual opinions of Members
			<lb />
			of Parliament or Convention to construe the meaning of the particular
			<lb />
			clause, when a question is raised whether a certain phrase or expression
			<lb />
			was up for consideration at all or not, a reference to the debates may be
			<lb />
			permitted. In the present case the debates were referred to show that the
			<lb />
			expression &quot;due process of law&quot; was known to exist in the American
			<lb />
			Constitution and after a discussion was not adopted by the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly in our Constitution. In Administrator General of Bengal v.
			<lb />
			Premlal Mullick a reference to the proceedings of the legislature which
			<lb />
			resulted in the passing of the Act was not considered legitimate aid in the
			<lb />
			construction of a particular section. The same reasons were held as cogent
			<lb />
			for excluding a reference to such debates in construing an Indian statute.
			<lb />
			Resort may be had to these sources with great caution and only when latent
			<lb />
			ambiguities are to be resolved.&quot; 393
			<lb />
			209. This view was endorsed by Fazl Ali, J who referred to the expression
			<lb />
			&apos;due process of law&apos; which was originally interpreted by the United States
			<lb />
			Supreme Court as referring to matters of procedure but was subsequently
			<lb />
			widened to cover substantive law as well. The learned judge held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;In the course of the arguments, the learned Attorney-General referred us
			<lb />
			to the proceedings in the Constituent Assembly for the purpose of showing
			<lb />
			that the article as originally drafted contained the words &quot;without due
			<lb />
			process of law&quot; but these words were subsequently replaced by the words
			<lb />
			&quot;except according to procedure established by law&quot;. In my opinion, though
			<lb />
			the proceedings or discussions in the Assembly are not relevant for the
			<lb />
			purpose of construing the meaning of the expressions used in Article 21,
			<lb />
			especially when they are plain and unambiguous, they are relevant to show
			<lb />
			that the Assembly intended to avoid the use of the expression &quot;without due
			<lb />
			process of law&quot;……. In the earliest times, the American Supreme Court
			<lb />
			construed &quot;due process of law&quot; to cover matters of procedure only, but
			<lb />
			gradually the meaning of the expression was widened so as to cover
			<lb />
			substantive law also, by laying emphasis on the word &quot;due&quot;. 394
			<lb />
			210. Justice Patanjali Sastri was of the same opinion and so the learned
			<lb />
			judge held as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Learned counsel drew attention to the speeches made by several members
			<lb />
			of the Assembly on the floor of the House for explaining, as he put it, the
			<lb />
			&quot;historical background&quot;. A speech made in the course of the debate on a
			<lb />
			bill could at best be indicative of the subjective intent of the speaker, but it
			<lb />
			could not reflect the inarticulate mental processes lying behind the
			<lb />
			majority vote which carried the bill. Nor is it reasonable to assume that the
			<lb />
			minds of all those legislators were in accord. The Court could only search
			<lb />
			for the objective intent of the legislature primarily in the words used in the
			<lb />
			enactment, aided by such historical material as reports of statutory
			<lb />
			committees, preambles etc. I attach no importance, therefore, to the
			<lb />
			speeches made by some of the members of the Constituent Assembly in
			<lb />
			the course of the debate on Article 15 (now Article 21)&quot;. 395
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			211. Justice
			<lb />
			Mukherjea noted the concession of the learned
			<lb />
			Attorney-General that the CAD are not admissible to explain the meaning of
			<lb />
			the words used -a position quite the opposite from what is now taken by the
			<lb />
			learned Attorney-General. The learned judge then observed that such
			<lb />
			extrinsic evidence is best left out of account and held as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The learned Attorney-General has placed before us the debates in the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly centering round the adoption of this
			<lb />
			recommendation of the Drafting Committee and he has referred us to the
			<lb />
			speeches of several members of the Assembly who played an important
			<lb />
			part in the shaping of the Constitution. As an aid to discover the meaning
			<lb />
			of the words in a Constitution, these debates are of doubtful value. &quot;Resort
			<lb />
			can be had to them&quot;&apos; says Willoughby, &quot;with great caution and only when
			<lb />
			latent ambiguities are to be solved. The proceedings may be of some value
			<lb />
			when they clearly point out the purpose of the provision. But when the
			<lb />
			question is of abstract meaning, it will be difficult to derive from this
			<lb />
			source much material assistance in interpretation.&quot;
			<lb />
			The learned Attorney-General concedes that these debates are not
			<lb />
			admissible to explain the meaning of the words used and he wanted to use
			<lb />
			them only for the purpose of showing that the Constituent Assembly when
			<lb />
			they finally adopted the recommendation of the Drafting Committee, were
			<lb />
			fully aware of the implications of the differences between the old form of
			<lb />
			expression and the new. In my opinion, in interpreting the Constitution, it
			<lb />
			will be better if such extrinsic evidence is left out of account. In matters
			<lb />
			like this, different members act upon different impulses and from different
			<lb />
			motives and it is quite possible that some members accepted certain words
			<lb />
			in a particular sense, while others took them in a different light.&quot; 396
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			212. Justice S.R. Das specifically stated that he expresses no opinion on the
			<lb />
			question of admissibility or otherwise of the CAD to interpret the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			213. In State of Travancore-Cochin v. The Bombay Co. Ltd. 397 it was
			<lb />
			unanimously held that reference to the CAD is unwarranted and such an
			<lb />
			extrinsic aid to the interpretation of statutes is not admissible. Speaking for
			<lb />
			the Court, Chief Justice Patanjali Sastri held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It remains only to point out that the use made by the learned Judges
			<lb />
			below of the speeches made by the members of the Constituent Assembly
			<lb />
			in the course of the debates on the draft Constitution is unwarranted. That
			<lb />
			this form of extrinsic aid to the interpretation of statutes is not admissible
			<lb />
			has been generally accepted in England, and the same rule has been
			<lb />
			observed in the construction of Indian statutes -see
			<lb />
			Administrator-General of Bengal v. Prem Lal Mallick. The reason behind
			<lb />
			the rule was explained by one of us in Gopalan case thus:
			<lb />
			&quot;A speech made in the course of the debate on a bill could at best
			<lb />
			be indicative of the subjective intent of the speaker, but it could not
			<lb />
			reflect the inarticulate mental process lying behind the majority
			<lb />
			vote which carried the bill. Nor is it reasonable to assume that the
			<lb />
			minds of all those legislators were in accord,&quot;
			<lb />
			or, as it is more tersely put in an American case-
			<lb />
			&quot;Those who did not speak may not have agreed with those who
			<lb />
			did; and those who spoke might differ from each other -United
			<lb />
			States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association. 398 &quot; 399
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			214. In Golak Nath v. State of Punjab 400 Chief Justice Subba Rao noted the
			<lb />
			submissions of the petitioners, one of which was:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The debates in the Constituent Assembly, particularly the speech of Mr
			<lb />
			Jawahar Lal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, and the reply of Dr
			<lb />
			Ambedkar, who piloted the Bill disclose clearly that it was never the
			<lb />
			intention of the makers of the Constitution by putting in Article 368 to
			<lb />
			enable the Parliament to repeal the fundamental rights; the circumstances
			<lb />
			under which the amendment moved by Mr H.V. Kamath, one of the
			<lb />
			members of Constituent Assembly, was withdrawn and Article 368 was
			<lb />
			finally adopted, support the contention that amendment of Part III is
			<lb />
			outside the scope of Article 368.&quot; 401
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			215. The submissions of the learned Attorney-General were also noted and
			<lb />
			one of which was, again, diametrically opposed to the submission made
			<lb />
			before us by the learned Attorney-General:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Debates in the Constituent Assembly cannot be relied upon for construing
			<lb />
			Article 368 of the Constitution and even if they can be, there is nothing in
			<lb />
			the debates to prove positively that fundamental rights were excluded from
			<lb />
			amendment.&quot; 402
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			216. The learned Chief Justice (speaking for the majority) referred to the
			<lb />
			CAD and observed:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;We have referred to the speeches of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Dr.
			<lb />
			Ambedkar not with a view to interpret the provisions of Art. 368, which
			<lb />
			we propose to do on its own terms, but only to notice the transcendental
			<lb />
			character given to the fundamental rights by two of the important
			<lb />
			architects of the Constitution.&quot; 403
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			217. Justice Wanchoo dealt with the issue a bit more elaborately and on a
			<lb />
			consideration of the law (drawing support from Prem Lal Mullick and A.K.
			<lb />
			Gopalan) held that the CAD could not be looked into for interpreting Article
			<lb />
			368 of the Constitution and that the said Article &apos;must be interpreted on the
			<lb />
			words thereof as they finally found place in the Constitution.&apos; It was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Copious references were made during the course of arguments to debates
			<lb />
			in Parliament and it is urged that it is open to this Court to look into the
			<lb />
			debates in order to interpret Article 368 to find out the intention of the
			<lb />
			Constitution-makers. We are of opinion that we cannot and should not look
			<lb />
			into the debates that took place in the Constituent Assembly to determine
			<lb />
			the interpretation of Article 368 and the scope and extent of the provision
			<lb />
			contained therein. It may be conceded that historical background and
			<lb />
			perhaps what was accepted or what was rejected by the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly while the Constitution was being framed, may be taken into
			<lb />
			account in finding out the scope and extent of Article 368. But we have no
			<lb />
			doubt that what was spoken in the debates in the Constituent Assembly
			<lb />
			cannot and should not be looked into in order to interpret Article
			<lb />
			368………..
			<lb />
			We are therefore of opinion that it is not possible to read the speeches
			<lb />
			made in the Constituent Assembly in order to interpret Article 368 or to
			<lb />
			define its extent and scope and to determine what it takes in and what it
			<lb />
			does not. As to the historical facts, namely, what was accepted or what was
			<lb />
			avoided in the Constituent Assembly in connection with Article 368, it is
			<lb />
			enough to say that we have not been able to find any help from the
			<lb />
			material relating to this. There were proposals for restricting the power of
			<lb />
			amendment under Article 368 and making fundamental rights immune
			<lb />
			therefrom and there were counter proposals before the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly for making the power of amendment all-embracing. They were
			<lb />
			all either dropped or negatived and in the circumstances are of no help in
			<lb />
			determining the interpretation of Article 368 which must be interpreted on
			<lb />
			the words thereof as they finally found place in the Constitution, and on
			<lb />
			those words we have no doubt that there are no implied limitations of any
			<lb />
			kind on the power to amend given therein.&quot; 404
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			218. Justice Bachawat concluded his judgment by referring to the issue of
			<lb />
			the CAD being an aid to interpreting the Constitution. In rather terse words,
			<lb />
			the learned judge rejected the submission made in this regard and relied upon
			<lb />
			State of Travancore-Cochin. This is what was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Before concluding this judgment I must refer to some of the speeches
			<lb />
			made by the members of the Constituent Assembly in the course of debates
			<lb />
			on the draft constitution. These speeches cannot be used as aids for
			<lb />
			interpreting the Constitution. See State of Travancore-Cochin and others v.
			<lb />
			Bombay Co. Ltd. Accordingly, I do not rely on them as aids to
			<lb />
			construction.&quot; 405
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			219. Justice Bachawat also makes a rather interesting reference to a special
			<lb />
			article written by Sir B.N. Rau (Constitutional Adviser) on 15 th August,
			<lb />
			1948. Sir Benegal remarked:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It seems rather illogical that a constitution should be settled by simple
			<lb />
			majority by an assembly elected indirectly on a very limited franchise and
			<lb />
			that it should not be capable of being amended in the same way by a
			<lb />
			Parliament elected -and perhaps for the most part elected directly by adult
			<lb />
			suffrage.&quot; 406
			<lb />
			This is mentioned, without any comment, only to throw open the thought
			<lb />
			whether the interpretation of the Constitution can be tied down forever to the
			<lb />
			views expressed by a few Hon&apos;ble Members of the Constituent Assembly,
			<lb />
			who were undoubtedly extremely learned and visionary but who nevertheless
			<lb />
			constituted &apos;an assembly elected indirectly on a very limited franchise&apos;.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			220. In Kesavananda Bharati it was held by Chief Justice Sikri that
			<lb />
			&apos;speeches made by members of the legislature in the course of debates
			<lb />
			relating to the enactment of a statute cannot be used as aids for interpreting
			<lb />
			any provisions of the statute.&apos; The learned Chief Justice held that the same
			<lb />
			rule is applicable to provisions of the Constitution as well and for this
			<lb />
			reliance was placed, inter alia, on Prem Lal Mullick, A.K Gopalan, State of
			<lb />
			Travancore-Cochin and Golak Nath. Explaining Union of India v. H.S.
			<lb />
			Dhillon 407 the learned Chief Justice said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;In Union of India v. H.S. Dhillon I, on behalf of the majority, before
			<lb />
			referring to the speeches observed at p. 58 that &quot;we are however, glad to
			<lb />
			find from the following extracts from the debates that our interpretation
			<lb />
			accords with what was intended&quot;. There is no harm in finding confirmation
			<lb />
			of one&apos;s interpretation in debates but it is quite a different thing to interpret
			<lb />
			the provisions of the Constitution in the light of the debates.&quot; 408
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			221. Apart from relying on case law, the learned Chief Justice gave an
			<lb />
			additional reason for concluding that reliance on the CAD was not advisable
			<lb />
			for interpreting the provisions of the Constitution. This is best understood in
			<lb />
			the words of the learned Chief Justice:
			<lb />

			&quot;There is an additional reason for not referring to debates for the purpose
			<lb />
			of interpretation. The Constitution, as far as most of the Indian States were
			<lb />
			concerned, came into operation only because of the acceptance by the
			<lb />
			Ruler or Rajpramukh. This is borne out by the following extract from the
			<lb />
			statement of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in the Constituent Assembly on
			<lb />
			October 12, 1949, (CAD, Vol. X, pp. 161-63):
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Unfortunately we have no properly constituted legislatures in the
			<lb />
			rest of the States (apart from Mysore, Saurashtra and Travancore
			<lb />
			and Cochin Union) nor will it be possible to have legislatures
			<lb />
			constituted in them before the Constitution of India emerges in its
			<lb />
			final form. We have, therefore, no option but to make the
			<lb />
			Constitution operative in these States on the basis of its acceptance
			<lb />
			by the Rulers or the Rajpramukh, as the case may be, who will no
			<lb />
			doubt consult his Council of Ministers.&quot;
			<lb />
			In accordance with this statement, declarations were issued by the Rulers
			<lb />
			or Rajpramukhs accepting the Constitution.
			<lb />
			It seems to me that when a Ruler or Rajpramukh or the people of the State
			<lb />
			accepted the Constitution of India in its final form, he did not accept it
			<lb />
			subject to the speeches made during the Constituent Assembly debates.
			<lb />
			The speeches can, in my view, be relied on only in order to see if the
			<lb />
			course of the progress of a particular provision or provisions throws any
			<lb />
			light on the historical background or shows that a common understanding
			<lb />
			or agreement was arrived at between certain sections of the people.&quot; 409
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			222. Justice Hegde and Justice A.K Mukherjea also held that reliance could
			<lb />
			not be placed on the CAD to interpret any provision of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			Reference was made to State of Travancore-Cochin and it was held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;For finding out the true scope of Article 31(2) as it stands now, the
			<lb />
			learned Advocate-General of Maharashtra as well as the Solicitor-General
			<lb />
			has taken us through the history of this article. According to them the
			<lb />
			article as it stands now truly represents the intention of the
			<lb />
			Constitution-makers. In support of that contention, we were asked to go
			<lb />
			through the Constituent Assembly debates relating to that article. In
			<lb />
			particular we were invited to go through the speeches made by Pandit
			<lb />
			Nehru, Sir Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar, Dr Munshi and Dr Ambedkar. In
			<lb />
			our opinion, it is impermissible for us to do so. It is a well-settled rule of
			<lb />
			construction that speeches made by members of a Legislature in the course
			<lb />
			of debates relating to the enactment of a statute cannot be used as aids for
			<lb />
			interpreting any of the provisions of the statute. The same rule is
			<lb />
			applicable when we are called upon to interpret the provisions of a
			<lb />
			Constitution.&quot;
		</item>
		<p>
			410
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			The learned judges observed that no decision was brought to their notice
			<lb />
			dissenting with the view mentioned above.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			223. Justice H.R Khanna was also of the opinion that the CAD could be
			<lb />
			referred only for the limited purpose of determining the history of the
			<lb />
			constitutional provision. The CAD &apos;cannot form the basis for construing the
			<lb />
			provisions of the Constitution.&apos; The learned judge further said that the
			<lb />
			intention of the draftsman of a statute would have to be gathered from the
			<lb />
			words used. The learned judge said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The speeches in the Constituent Assembly, in my opinion, can be referred
			<lb />
			to for finding the history of the Constitutional provision and the
			<lb />
			background against which the said provision was drafted. The speeches
			<lb />
			can also shed light to show as to what was the mischief which was sought
			<lb />
			to be remedied and what was the object which was sought to be attained in
			<lb />
			drafting the provision. The speeches cannot, however, form the basis for
			<lb />
			construing the provisions of the Constitution. The task of interpreting the
			<lb />
			provision of the Constitution has to be done independently and the
			<lb />
			reference to the speeches made in the Constituent Assembly does not
			<lb />
			absolve the court from performing that task. The draftsmen are supposed to
			<lb />
			have expressed their intentions in the words used by them in the
			<lb />
			provisions. Those words are final repositories of the intention and it would
			<lb />
			be ultimately from the words of the provision that the intention of the
			<lb />
			draftsmen would have to be gathered.&quot; 411
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			224. Justice Y.V. Chandrachud relied upon State of Travancore-Cochin,
			<lb />
			A.K. Gopalan and Golak Nath to conclude:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Debates of the Constituent Assembly and of the First Provisional
			<lb />
			Parliament were extensively read out to us during the course of arguments.
			<lb />
			I read the speeches with interest, but in my opinion, the debates are not
			<lb />
			admissible as aids to construction of constitutional provisions.&quot; 412
			<lb />
			A little later it was said:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;It is hazardous to rely upon parliamentary debates as aids to statutory
			<lb />
			construction. Different speakers have different motives and the system of
			<lb />
			&quot;Party Whip&quot; leaves no warrant for assuming that those who voted but did
			<lb />
			not speak were of identical persuasion. That assumption may be difficult to
			<lb />
			make even in regard to those who speak. The safest course is to gather the
			<lb />
			intention of the legislature from the language it uses. Therefore,
			<lb />
			parliamentary proceedings can be used only for a limited purpose as
			<lb />
			explained in Gopalan case.&quot; 413
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			225. A contrary view was rhetorically expressed by Justice Jaganmohan
			<lb />
			Reddy but it was eventually held that the CAD could aid in interpretation,
			<lb />
			being &apos;valuable material&apos; unlike legislative debates which could be motivated
			<lb />
			by partisan views and party politics. Constituent Assembly Debates were not
			<lb />
			motivated by such partisan considerations. It was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Speaking for myself, why should we not look into them [CAD] boldly for
			<lb />
			ascertaining what was the intention of our framers and how they translated
			<lb />
			that intention? What is the rationale for treating them as forbidden or
			<lb />
			forbidding material. The Court in a constitutional matter, where the intent
			<lb />
			of the framers of the Constitution as embodied in the written document is
			<lb />
			to be ascertained, should look into the proceedings, the relevant data
			<lb />
			including any speech which may throw light on ascertaining it. It can reject
			<lb />
			them as unhelpful, if they throw no light or throw only dim light in which
			<lb />
			nothing can be discerned……….. In proceedings of a legislature on an
			<lb />
			ordinary draft bill, as I said earlier, there may be a partisan and heated
			<lb />
			debate, which often times may not throw any light on the issues which
			<lb />
			come before the Court but the proceedings in a Constituent Assembly have
			<lb />
			no such partisan nuances and their only concern is to give the national a
			<lb />
			working instrument with its basic structure and human values sufficiently
			<lb />
			balanced and stable enough to allow an interplay of forces which will
			<lb />
			subserve the needs of future generations. The highest Court created under
			<lb />
			it and charged with the duty of understanding and expounding it, should
			<lb />
			not, if it has to catch the objectives of the framers, deny itself the benefit of
			<lb />
			the guidance derivable from the records of the proceedings and the
			<lb />
			deliberations of the Assembly.&quot; 414
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			226. Justice K.K. Mathew supported the view of Justice Jaganmohan
			<lb />
			Reddy and observed that: &apos;Logically, there is no reason why we should
			<lb />
			exclude altogether the speeches made in the Constituent Assembly by
			<lb />
			individual members if they throw any light which will resolve latent
			<lb />
			ambiguity in a provision of Constitution.&apos; The learned judge went on to hold
			<lb />
			in a subsequent paragraph of the decision:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;If the debates in the Constituent Assembly can be looked into to
			<lb />
			understand the legislative history of a provision of the Constitution
			<lb />
			including its derivation, that is, the various steps leading up to and
			<lb />
			attending its enactment, to ascertain the intention of the makers of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, it is difficult to see why the debates are inadmissible to throw
			<lb />
			light on the purpose and general intent of the provision. After all,
			<lb />
			legislative history only tends to reveal the legislative purpose in enacting
			<lb />
			the provision and thereby sheds light upon legislative intent. It would be
			<lb />
			drawing an invisible distinction if resort to debates is permitted simply to
			<lb />
			show the legislative history and the same is not allowed to show the
			<lb />
			legislative intent in case of latent ambiguity in the provision.&quot; 415
			<lb />
			227. In Samsher Singh in their concurring opinion, Justice Krishna Iyer
			<lb />
			(for himself and Justice P.N. Bhagwati) extensively referred to the CAD for
			<lb />
			arriving at their conclusion, while Chief Justice Ray (for himself and four
			<lb />
			other learned judges) made no reference to the CAD.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			228. Be that as it may, reference to the CAD again came up for
			<lb />
			consideration in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India. 416 Speaking for the
			<lb />
			learned Chief Justice, Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah, Justice Ahmadi and
			<lb />
			himself, Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy clarified that though the CAD or the
			<lb />
			speeches of Dr. Ambedkar cannot be ignored, they are not conclusive or
			<lb />
			binding on the Court but can be relied upon as an aid to interpreting a
			<lb />
			constitutional provision. The CAD were referred to for &apos;furnishing the
			<lb />
			context and the objective&apos; to be achieved by clause (4) of Article 16 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. Reference was made, inter alia, to Golaknath, Dhillon and
			<lb />
			Kesavananda Bharati and it was held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;We are aware that what is said during these debates is not conclusive or
			<lb />
			binding upon the Court because several members may have expressed
			<lb />
			several views, all of which may not be reflected in the provision finally
			<lb />
			enacted. The speech of Dr Ambedkar on this aspect, however, stands on a
			<lb />
			different footing. He was not only the Chairman of the Drafting
			<lb />
			Committee which inserted the expression &quot;backward&quot; in draft Article 10(3)
			<lb />
			[it was not there in the original draft Article 10(3)], he was virtually
			<lb />
			piloting the draft Article. In his speech, he explains the reason behind draft
			<lb />
			clause (3) as also the reason for which the Drafting Committee added the
			<lb />
			expression &quot;backward&quot; in the clause. In this situation, we fail to
			<lb />
			understand how can anyone ignore his speech while trying to ascertain the
			<lb />
			meaning of the said expression. That the debates in Constituent Assembly
			<lb />
			can be relied upon as an aid to interpretation of a constitutional provision
			<lb />
			is borne out by a series of decisions of this Court……… Since the
			<lb />
			expression &quot;backward&quot; or &quot;backward class of citizens&quot; is not defined in
			<lb />
			the Constitution, reference to such debates is permissible to ascertain, at
			<lb />
			any rate, the context, background and objective behind them. Particularly,
			<lb />
			where the Court wants to ascertain the &apos;original intent&apos; such reference may
			<lb />
			be unavoidable.&quot; 417
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			229. In S.R. Chaudhuri v. State of Punjab 418 it was held that it is settled
			<lb />
			that the CAD may be relied upon &apos;as an aid to interpret a constitutional
			<lb />
			provision because it is the function of the court to find out the intention of
			<lb />
			the framers of the Constitution.&apos; This view was followed by me in Manoj
			<lb />
			Narula v. Union of India. 419
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			230. In T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka 420 Justice Khare
			<lb />
			referred to Kesavananda Bharati and observed therein that though the CAD
			<lb />
			are not conclusive, yet they can throw light into the intention of the framers
			<lb />
			in enacting provisions of the Constitution. On this basis the learned judge
			<lb />
			held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Thus, the accepted view appears to be that the report of the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly debates can legitimately be taken into consideration for
			<lb />
			construction of the provisions of the Act or the Constitution.&quot; 421
			<lb />
			231. Justice Variava (for himself and Justice Bhan) also referred to
			<lb />
			Kesavananda Bharati and held that though the CAD are not conclusive, but
			<lb />
			&apos;in a constitutional matter where the intent of the framers of the Constitution
			<lb />
			is to be ascertained, the Court should look into the proceedings and the
			<lb />
			relevant data, including the speeches, which throw light on ascertaining the
			<lb />
			intent.&apos;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			232. Justice Syed Shah Quadri stated an interesting principle in the
			<lb />
			following words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The correct way to interpret an article is to go by its plain language and
			<lb />
			lay bare the meaning it conveys. It would no doubt be useful to refer to the
			<lb />
			historical and political background which supports the interpretation given
			<lb />
			by the court and in that context the debates of the Constituent Assembly
			<lb />
			would be the best record of understanding all those aspects. A host of
			<lb />
			considerations might have prompted the people of India through Members
			<lb />
			of Constituent Assembly to adopt, enact and to give to themselves the
			<lb />
			Constitution. We are really concerned with what they have adopted,
			<lb />
			enacted and given to themselves in these documents. We cannot and we
			<lb />
			should not cause scar on it which would take years for the coming
			<lb />
			generations to remove from its face.&quot; 422
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			233. The learned judge then went on to hold, relying on Prem Lal Mullick,
			<lb />
			A.K. Gopalan, State of Travancore-Cochin, Kesavananda Bharati and
			<lb />
			Indra Sawhney that &apos;admissibility of speeches made in the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly for interpreting provisions of the Constitution is not permissible&apos;
			<lb />
			and that &apos;The preponderance of opinion appears to me not to rely on the
			<lb />
			debates in the Constituent Assembly or the Parliament to interpret a
			<lb />
			constitutional provision although they may be relevant for other purposes.&apos;
			<lb />
			The learned judge quoted a sentence from Black Clawson International Ltd.
			<lb />
			v. Papierwerke Waldhof-Aschaffenburg Aktiengesellschaft 423 to the
			<lb />
			following effect:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;We are seeking not what Parliament meant but the true meaning of what
			<lb />
			Parliament said.&quot; 424
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			234. In re: Special Reference No. 1 of 2002 (Gujarat Assembly Election
			<lb />
			Matter) 425 the issue of relying on the CAD again came up for consideration.
			<lb />
			Justice Khare (for the Chief Justice, Justice Bhan and himself) referred to
			<lb />
			Kesavananda Bharati and held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Constituent Assembly Debates although not conclusive, yet show the
			<lb />
			intention of the framers of the Constitution in enacting provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution and the Constituent Assembly Debates can throw light in
			<lb />
			ascertaining the intention behind such provisions.&quot; 426
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			235. In a decision rendered by the Constitutional Court of the Republic of
			<lb />
			South Africa in The State v. T. Makwanyane 427 a brief survey of the law in
			<lb />
			the United States Supreme Court, German Constitutional Court, Canadian
			<lb />
			Supreme Court, this Court, European Court of Human Rights and the United
			<lb />
			Nations Committee on Human Rights was carried out and it was held (per
			<lb />
			Justice Chaskalson):
			<lb />
			In countries in which the constitution is similarly the supreme law, it is not
			<lb />
			unusual for the courts to have regard to the circumstances existing at the
			<lb />
			time the constitution was adopted, including the debates and writings
			<lb />
			which formed part of the process. The United States Supreme Court pays
			<lb />
			attention to such matters, and its judgments frequently contain reviews of
			<lb />
			the legislative history of the provision in question, including references to
			<lb />
			debates, and statements made, at the time the provision was adopted. The
			<lb />
			German Constitutional Court also has regard to such evidence. The
			<lb />
			Canadian Supreme Court has held such evidence to be admissible, and has
			<lb />
			referred to the historical background including the pre-confederation
			<lb />
			debates for the purpose of interpreting provisions of the Canadian
			<lb />
			Constitution, although it attaches less weight to such information than the
			<lb />
			United States Supreme Court does. It also has regard to ministerial
			<lb />
			statements in Parliament in regard to the purpose of particular legislation.
			<lb />
			In India, whilst speeches of individual members of Parliament or the
			<lb />
			Convention are apparently not ordinarily admissible, the reports of drafting
			<lb />
			committees can, according to Seervai, &quot;be a helpful extrinsic aid to
			<lb />
			construction.&quot; Seervai cites Kania CJ in A. K. Gopalan v The State for the
			<lb />
			proposition that whilst not taking &quot;...into consideration the individual
			<lb />
			opinions of Members of Parliament or Convention to construe the meaning
			<lb />
			of a particular clause, when a question is raised whether a certain phrase or
			<lb />
			expression was up for consideration at all or not, a reference to debates
			<lb />
			may be permitted.&quot; The European Court of Human Rights and the United
			<lb />
			Nations Committee on Human Rights all allow their deliberations to be
			<lb />
			informed by travaux preparatoires.&quot; 428 (Internal citations omitted)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			236. Earlier, on a consideration of the law in England it was held (per
			<lb />
			Justice Chaskalon):
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Debates in Parliament, including statements made by Ministers
			<lb />
			responsible for legislation, and explanatory memoranda providing reasons
			<lb />
			for new bills have not been admitted as background material. It is,
			<lb />
			however, permissible to take notice of the report of a judicial commission
			<lb />
			of enquiry for the limited purpose of ascertaining &quot;the mischief aimed at
			<lb />
			the statutory enactment in question.&quot; These principles were derived in part
			<lb />
			from English law. In England, the courts have recently relaxed this
			<lb />
			exclusionary rule and have held, in Pepper (Inspector of Taxes) v Hart that,
			<lb />
			subject to the privileges of the House of Commons:
			<lb />
			...reference to Parliamentary material should be permitted as an aid
			<lb />
			to the construction of legislation which is ambiguous or obscure or
			<lb />
			the literal meaning of which leads to an absurdity. Even in such
			<lb />
			cases references in court to Parliamentary material should only be
			<lb />
			permitted where such material clearly discloses the mischief aimed
			<lb />
			at or the legislative intention lying behind the ambiguous or
			<lb />
			obscure words.&quot; 429 (Internal citations omitted)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			237. It is quite clear that the overwhelming view of the various learned
			<lb />
			judges in different decisions rendered by this Court and in other jurisdictions
			<lb />
			as well is that: (1) A reference may be made to the CAD or to Parliamentary
			<lb />
			debates (as indeed to any other &apos;relevant material&apos;) to understand the context
			<lb />
			in which the constitutional or statutory provisions were framed and to gather
			<lb />
			the intent of the law makers but only if there is some ambiguity or
			<lb />
			uncertainty or incongruity or obscurity in the language of the provision. A
			<lb />
			reference to the CAD or the Parliamentary debates ought not to be made only
			<lb />
			because they are there; 430 (2) The CAD or Parliamentary debates ought not to
			<lb />
			428 Paragraph 16
			<lb />
			429 Paragraph 14
			<lb />
			430 With due apologies to George Mallory who is famously quoted as having replied to the question &quot;Why
			<lb />
			do you want to climb Mount Everest?&quot; with the retort &quot;Because it&apos;s there.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Page 708
			<lb />
			be relied upon to interpret the provisions of the Constitution or the statute if
			<lb />
			there is no ambiguity in the language used. These provisions ought to be
			<lb />
			interpreted independently -or at least, if reference is made to the CAD or
			<lb />
			Parliamentary debates, the Court should not be unduly influenced by the
			<lb />
			speeches made. Confirmation of the interpretation may be sought from the
			<lb />
			CAD or the Parliamentary debates but not vice versa.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			238. This discussion has been necessitated by the submission of the
			<lb />
			learned Attorney-General that the Constituent Assembly did not intend that
			<lb />
			for the appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court or of the High Court the
			<lb />
			concurrence of the Chief Justice of India is necessary. The word
			<lb />
			&apos;consultation&apos; in Article 124 of the Constitution and in Article 217 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution did not and could not mean &apos;concurrence&apos;. This, according to
			<lb />
			the learned Attorney-General is specifically and clearly borne out from the
			<lb />
			CAD. In fact, the learned Attorney-General drew our attention to the
			<lb />
			discussion that took place in the Constituent Assembly on 23 rd and 24 th May,
			<lb />
			1949.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			239. It was submitted that under the circumstances there was no ambiguity
			<lb />
			in the meaning of the word &apos;consultation&apos; and a reference to the CAD was
			<lb />
			necessary, applying the dictum of Chief Justice Sikri, only to confirm the
			<lb />
			interpretation of &apos;consultation&apos; as not meaning &apos;concurrence&apos;. It is for this
			<lb />
			reason, apart from others that the Second Judges case and the Third Judges
			<lb />
			case required reconsideration.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			240. The learned Attorney-General also drew our attention to the following
			<lb />
			expression of opinion by Mr. T.T. Krishnamachari in the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly on 27 th May, 1949 in relation to clause (3) of the draft Article 122
			<lb />
			concerning the officers and servants and expenses of the Supreme Court. 431
			<lb />
			The contention was that it was not the intention of the Constituent Assembly
			<lb />
			to make the Chief Justice of India or the Supreme Court above the executive
			<lb />
			or the Legislature thereby discarding the theory of separation of powers, and
			<lb />
			if &apos;consultation&apos; is interpreted to mean &apos;concurrence&apos;, then that would be the
			<lb />
			inevitable result. Reliance was placed on the following speech:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;While I undoubtedly support the amendment moved by Dr. Ambedkar, I
			<lb />
			think it should be understood by the Members of this House, and I do hope
			<lb />
			by those people who will be administering justice and also administering
			<lb />
			the country in the future that this is a safeguard rather than an operative
			<lb />
			provision. The only thing about it is that a matter like the employment of
			<lb />
			staff by the Judges should be placed ordinarily outside the purview of the
			<lb />
			Executive which would otherwise have to take the initiative to include
			<lb />
			these items in the budget for the reason that the independence of the
			<lb />
			Judiciary should be maintained and that the Judiciary should not feel that
			<lb />
			they are subject to favours that the Executive might grant to them from
			<lb />
			time to time and which would naturally influence their decision in any
			<lb />
			matter they have to take where the interests of the Executive of the time
			<lb />
			being happens to be concerned. At the same time, Sir, I think it should be
			<lb />
			made clear that it is not the intention of this House or of the framers of this
			<lb />
			Constitution that they want to create specially favoured bodies which in
			<lb />
			themselves becomes an Imperium in Imperio, completely independent of
			<lb />
			the Executive and the Legislature and operating as a sort of superior body
			<lb />
			to the general body politic. If that were so, I think we should be rather
			<lb />
			chary of introducing a provision of this nature, not merely in regard to the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court but also in regard to the Auditor-General, in regard to the
			<lb />
			Union Public Service Commission, in regard to the Speaker and the
			<lb />
			President of the two House of Parliament and so on, as we will thereby be
			<lb />
			creating a number of bodies which are placed in such a position that they
			<lb />
			are bound to come into conflict with the Executive in every attempt they
			<lb />
			make to display their superiority. In actual practice, it is better for all these
			<lb />
			bodies to more or less fall in line with the regulations that obtain in matters
			<lb />
			431 (3) The administrative expenses of the Supreme Court, including all salaries, allowances and pensions
			<lb />
			payable to or in respect of the officers and servants of the court, shall be charged upon the revenues of
			<lb />
			India, and any fees or other moneys taken by the court shall form part of those revenues.
			<lb />
			of recruitment to the public services, conditions of promotion and salaries
			<lb />
			paid to their staff.&quot; 432
			<lb />
			Replying to this debate, Dr. Ambedkar clarified the position that there was
			<lb />
			no question of creating an Imperium in Imperio. Dr. Ambedkar said:

			&quot;Mr. President, Sir, I would just like to make a few observations in order to
			<lb />
			clear the position. Sir, there is no doubt that the House in general, has
			<lb />
			agreed that the independence of the Judiciary from the Executive should be
			<lb />
			made as clear and definite as we could make it by law. At the same time,
			<lb />
			there is the fear that in the name of the independence of the Judiciary, we
			<lb />
			might be creating, what my Friend Mr. T. T. Krishnamachari very aptly
			<lb />
			called an &quot;Imperium in Imperio&quot;. We do not want to create an Imperium in
			<lb />
			Imperio, and at the same time we want to give the Judiciary ample
			<lb />
			independence so that it can act without fear or favour of the Executive. My
			<lb />
			friend, if they will carefully examine the provisions of the new amendment
			<lb />
			which I have proposed in place of the original article 122, will find that the
			<lb />
			new article proposes to steer a middle course. It refuses to create an
			<lb />
			Imperium in Imperio, and I think it gives the Judiciary as much
			<lb />
			independence as is necessary for the purpose of administering justice
			<lb />
			without fear or favour. I need not therefore, dilate on all the provisions
			<lb />
			contained in this new article 122…..&quot; 433
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			241. It is quite clear from the above that the endeavour of Dr. Ambedkar
			<lb />
			was to ensure the independence of the judiciary from the executive without
			<lb />
			creating any power imbalance and this, therefore, needed steering a middle
			<lb />
			course whether in the appointment of judges or the officers of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court. There can be no doubt about this at all. But what is the &apos;independence
			<lb />
			of the judiciary&apos; and how can it be maintained and does the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act impact on that independence? These are some troubling
			<lb />
			questions that need an answer with reference to the issue before us, namely,
			<lb />
			the constitutional validity of the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act.
			<lb />
			Judicial pronouncements and the third preliminary issue
			<lb />
			242. The learned Attorney-General submitted that in any event the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case requires reconsideration. There is large volume of case law
			<lb />
			which gives guidance on the circumstances when an earlier decision of this
			<lb />
			Court should be reconsidered. It is necessary to consider these cases before
			<lb />
			deciding whether a platform for reconsideration of the Second Judges case
			<lb />
			has been made.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			243. Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar &amp; Ors. 434 concerned the
			<lb />
			interpretation of Article 286 of the Constitution which, it was contended, had
			<lb />
			been incorrectly interpreted in State of Bombay v. The United Motors
			<lb />
			(India) Ltd. 435 This Court addressed the issue of reconsideration of a
			<lb />
			previous decision rendered by it. Chief Justice Das (speaking for himself,
			<lb />
			Justice Vivian Bose and Justice Syed Jafer Imam) discussed the judgments
			<lb />
			delivered in England, Australia, the United States and by the Privy Council
			<lb />
			and was of the view (for several reasons) that a previous decision rendered
			<lb />
			by this Court could be departed from. It was observed that it was not easy to
			<lb />
			amend the Constitution and if an erroneous interpretation was put upon a
			<lb />
			provision thereof it could &apos;conceivably be perpetuated or may at any rate
			<lb />
			remain unrectified for a considerable time to the great detriment to public
			<lb />
			well being.&apos; It was held, inter alia, that if this Court was convinced of its
			<lb />
			error and &apos;baneful effect&apos; on the general interests of the public of an
			<lb />
			erroneous interpretation of a provision of the Constitution, then there is
			<lb />
			nothing in the Constitution that prevents this Court in departing from its
			<lb />
			earlier decision. It could also depart from a previous decision if it was vague
			<lb />
			or inconsistent or plainly erroneous. It was held that the doctrine of stare
			<lb />
			decisis &apos;is not an inflexible rule of law and cannot be permitted to perpetuate
			<lb />
			our errors to the detriment to the general welfare of the public or a
			<lb />
			considerable section thereof.&apos;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			244. In a significant passage (one that will have a bearing on this subject),
			<lb />
			it was observed:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The majority decision does not merely determine the rights of the two
			<lb />
			contending parties to the Bombay appeal. Its effect is far reaching as it
			<lb />
			affects the rights of all consuming public. It authorises the imposition and
			<lb />
			levying of a tax by the State on an interpretation of a constitutional
			<lb />
			provision which appears to us to be unsupportable. To follow that
			<lb />
			interpretation will result in perpetuating what, with humility we say, is an
			<lb />
			error and in perpetuating a tax burden imposed on the people which,
			<lb />
			according to our considered opinion, is manifestly and wholly
			<lb />
			unauthorised.
			<lb />
			It is not an ordinary pronouncement declaring the rights of two private
			<lb />
			individuals inter se. It involves an adjudication on the taxing power of the
			<lb />
			States as against the consuming public generally. If the decision is
			<lb />
			erroneous, as indeed we conceive it to be, we owe it to that public to
			<lb />
			protect them against the illegal tax burdens which the States are seeking to
			<lb />
			impose on the strength of that erroneous recent decision.&quot; 436
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			245. Justice N.H. Bhagwati also reviewed several decisions from various
			<lb />
			jurisdictions and agreed with Chief Justice Das but drew a distinction
			<lb />
			between reconsideration of a previous decision concerning the interpretation
			<lb />
			of a provision of a legislative enactment and the interpretation of a provision
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. While an erroneous interpretation of the former by the
			<lb />
			Court could be corrected by the Legislature, it was not easy to amend the
			<lb />
			Constitution to correct its erroneous interpretation by the Court. It is for this
			<lb />
			reason that Justice N.H. Bhagwati held that if the previous decision
			<lb />
			interpreting the provisions of the Constitution was &apos;manifestly wrong or
			<lb />
			erroneous&apos; and that &apos;public interest&apos; demanded its reconsideration then the
			<lb />
			Court should have no hesitation in doing so.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			246. Justice Jagannadhadas also held that this Court is competent to
			<lb />
			reconsider its earlier decisions. It was added that: &apos;But, it does not follow
			<lb />
			that such power can be exercised without restriction or limitation or that a
			<lb />
			prior decision can be reversed on the ground that, on later consideration, the
			<lb />
			Court disagrees with the prior decision and thinks it erroneous.&apos; It was held
			<lb />
			that though the power to reconsider a prior decision does exist, the actual
			<lb />
			exercise of that power should be confined &apos;within very narrow limits.&apos; The
			<lb />
			learned Judge preferred to adopt the view expressed by Justice Dixon of the
			<lb />
			High Court of Australia in Attorney-General for N.S.W. v. The Perpetual
			<lb />
			Trustee Co. Ltd. 437 to the effect that a prior decision should not be
			<lb />
			reconsidered simply because an opposite conclusion is to be preferred.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			247. Justice Venkatarama Aiyar also held the view that this Court could
			<lb />
			reconsider an earlier decision rendered by it. However, the learned Judge
			<lb />
			was of the opinion that the power to reconsider should be &apos;exercised very
			<lb />
			sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances, such as when a material
			<lb />
			provision of law had been overlooked, or where a fundamental assumption
			<lb />
			on which the decision is based, turns out to be mistaken.&apos; Agreeing with the
			<lb />
			view canvassed by Justice Jagannadhadas (and Justice Dixon) the learned
			<lb />
			Judge posed the following question and also answered it: &apos;Can we differ
			<lb />
			from a previous decision of this Court, because a view contrary to the one
			<lb />
			taken therein appears to be preferable? I would unhesitatingly answer it in
			<lb />
			the negative, not because the view previously taken must necessarily be
			<lb />
			infallible but because it is important in public interest that the law declared
			<lb />
			should be certain and final rather than that it should be declared in one sense
			<lb />
			or the other.&apos;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			248. Justice B.P. Sinha agreed with Justice Jagannadhadas and Justice
			<lb />
			Venkatarama Aiyar and held that a previous judgment of this Court ought not
			<lb />
			to be reviewed simply because another view may be taken of the points in
			<lb />
			controversy. This Court should review its previous decisions only in
			<lb />
			exceptional circumstances. It was observed that &apos;Definiteness and certainty
			<lb />
			of the legal position are essential conditions for the growth of the rule of
			<lb />
			law.&apos;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			249. Lt. Col. Khajoor Singh v. Union of India 438 concerned the
			<lb />
			interpretation of Article 226 of the Constitution and Article 32(2-A) of the
			<lb />
			Constitution (as applicable to Jammu &amp; Kashmir). Though Justice Subba
			<lb />
			Rao (dissenting) and Justice Das Gupta (concurring) delivered separate
			<lb />
			judgments, they did not advert to the question of reconsideration of a
			<lb />
			decision of this Court. Chief Justice B.P. Sinha speaking for the remaining
			<lb />
			learned judges took the view that a previous decision rendered by this Court
			<lb />
			may be reconsidered if there are &apos;clear and compelling reasons&apos; to do so or if
			<lb />
			there is a fair amount of unanimity that the previous decision is &apos;manifestly
			<lb />
			wrong&apos; or if it is demonstrated that the earlier decision was erroneous
			<lb />
			&apos;beyond all reasonable doubt&apos; particularly on a constitutional issue. If any
			<lb />
			inconvenience is felt on the interpretations of the provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution under consideration, then the remedy &apos;seems to be a
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment.&apos;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			250. In Keshav Mills v. CIT 439 the question for consideration was the scope
			<lb />
			of the High Court&apos;s powers under Section 66(4) of the Income Tax Act,
			<lb />
			1922. It was submitted by the learned Attorney-General that two earlier
			<lb />
			decisions on the subject, that is, New Jehangir Vakil Mills Ltd. v. CIT 440 and
			<lb />
			Petlad Turkey Red Dye Works Co. Ltd., Petlad v. CIT 441 needed
			<lb />
			reconsideration. In considering this submission, it was held that when this
			<lb />
			Court interprets a statutory provision, merely because an alternative view
			<lb />
			different from an opinion earlier expressed by this Court is more reasonable
			<lb />
			is not necessarily an adequate reason for reconsidering the earlier opinion.
			<lb />
			This Court should ask itself the question whether in the interests of the
			<lb />
			public good or for any other valid and compulsive reasons, it is necessary
			<lb />
			that the earlier decision should be revised. This Court held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;When this Court decides questions of law, its decisions are, under Article
			<lb />
			141 binding on all courts within the territory of India and so it must be the
			<lb />
			constant endeavour and concern of this Court to introduce and maintain an
			<lb />
			element of certainty and continuity in the interpretation of law in the
			<lb />
			country…..That is not to say that if on a subsequent occasion, the Court is
			<lb />
			satisfied that its earlier decision was clearly erroneous, it should hesitate to
			<lb />
			correct the error; but before a previous decision is pronounced to be
			<lb />
			plainly erroneous, the Court must be satisfied with a fair amount of
			<lb />
			unanimity amongst its members that a revision of the said view is fully
			<lb />
			justified.&quot; 442
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			251. Maganlal Chhaganlal v. Municipal Corporation of Greater
			<lb />
			Bombay 443 concerned the validity of proceedings under Chapter V-A of the
			<lb />
			Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888 and the Bombay Government
			<lb />
			Premises (Eviction) Act, 1955 in the context of the decision of this Court in
			<lb />
			Northern India Caterers v. State of Punjab. 444 Justice H.R. Khanna alone
			<lb />
			considered the question of overruling an earlier decision of this Court,
			<lb />
			namely, in Northern India Caterers. It was observed that certainty in law
			<lb />
			would be eroded if a decision that &apos;held the field&apos; for several years is readily
			<lb />
			overruled -&apos;certainty and continuity are essential ingredients of rule of law.&apos;
			<lb />
			It was held that if two views are possible then, simply because the earlier
			<lb />
			decision does not take a view that is more acceptable would not be a ground
			<lb />
			for overruling the earlier decision. An earlier decision ought to be overruled
			<lb />
			only for compelling reasons otherwise it would create &apos;uncertainty,
			<lb />
			instability and confusion if the law propounded by this Court on the basis of
			<lb />
			which numerous cases have been decided and many transactions have taken
			<lb />
			place is held to be not the correct law.&apos; Justice Khanna observed that new
			<lb />
			ideas and developments in the field of law and that the fullness of experience
			<lb />
			and indeed subsequent experience cannot be wished away. The learned judge
			<lb />
			held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			in different fields of life. Law, if it has to satisfy human needs and to meet
			<lb />
			the problems of life, must adapt itself to cope with new situations. Nobody
			<lb />
			is so gifted with foresight that he can divine all possible human events in
			<lb />
			advance and prescribe proper rules for each of them. There are, however,
			<lb />
			certain verities which are of the essence of the rule of law and no law can
			<lb />
			afford to do away with them. At the same time it has to be recognized that
			<lb />
			there is a continuing process of the growth of law and one can retard it
			<lb />
			only at the risk of alienating law from life itself. There should not be much
			<lb />
			hesitation to abandon an untenable position when the rule to be discarded
			<lb />
			was in its origin the product of institutions or conditions which have
			<lb />
			gained a new significance or development with the progress of years. It
			<lb />
			sometimes happens that the rule of law which grew up in remote
			<lb />
			generations may in the fullness of experience be found to serve another
			<lb />
			generation badly. The Court cannot allow itself to be tied down by and
			<lb />
			become captive of a view which in the light of the subsequent experience
			<lb />
			has been found to be patently erroneous, manifestly unreasonable or to
			<lb />
			cause hardship or to result in plain iniquity or public inconvenience.&quot; 445
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			252. Ganga Sugar Corporation v. State of Uttar Pradesh 446 related to the
			<lb />
			constitutional validity of a levy under the U.P. Sugarcane (Purchase Tax) Act,
			<lb />
			1961. The decision does not contain any detailed discussion on the subject of
			<lb />
			reconsideration of an earlier decision of this Court. But it was nevertheless
			<lb />
			held that decisions of a Constitution Bench must be accepted as final unless
			<lb />
			the subject is of fundamental importance to national life or the reasoning of
			<lb />
			the previous decision is so plainly erroneous that &apos;it is wiser to be ultimately
			<lb />
			right rather than to be consistently wrong. Stare decisis is not a ritual of
			<lb />
			convenience but a rule with limited exceptions. Pronouncements by
			<lb />
			Constitution Benches should not be treated so cavalierly as to be revised
			<lb />
			frequently.&apos;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			253. A rather exhaustive reference to the cases and the law laid down in
			<lb />
			different jurisdictions was adverted to in Union of India v. Raghubir
			<lb />
			Singh. 447 This decision concerned itself with the grant of solatium under the
			<lb />
			Land Acquisition Act, 1894 as amended by the Land Acquisition
			<lb />
			(Amendment) Act, 1984. Reference was made to the &apos;guidelines&apos; culled out
			<lb />
			from the decisions of the House of Lords 448 which suggest that the freedom
			<lb />
			to reconsider an earlier decision ought to be exercised sparingly; a decision
			<lb />
			ought not to be overruled if it upsets the legitimate expectation of persons
			<lb />
			who have made arrangements based on the earlier decision or causes great
			<lb />
			uncertainty in the law; decisions involving the interpretation of statutes or
			<lb />
			documents ought not to be overruled except in rare or exceptional
			<lb />
			circumstances; if the consequences of departing from an earlier decision are
			<lb />
			not foreseeable; merely because an earlier decision was wrongly taken is not
			<lb />
			a good enough justification for overruling it. On the other hand, a prior
			<lb />
			decision ought to be overruled &apos;if in relation to some broad issue or principle
			<lb />
			it is not considered just or in keeping with contemporary social conditions or
			<lb />
			modern conceptions of public policy.&apos;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			254. Reference was also made to several decisions earlier rendered by this
			<lb />
			Court (including those mentioned above) and though no new or different
			<lb />
			principles or guidelines were laid down, the law as stated by this Court was
			<lb />
			iterated, and it was observed: &apos;It is not necessary to refer to all the cases on
			<lb />
			the point. The broad guidelines are easily deducible from what has gone
			<lb />
			before. The possibility of further defining these guiding principles can be
			<lb />
			envisaged with further juridical experience, and when common
			<lb />
			jurisprudential values linking different national systems of law may make a
			<lb />
			consensual pattern possible. But that lies in the future.&apos;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			255. Echoing the views expressed in Maganlal Chhaganlal and Raghubir
			<lb />
			Singh with regard to acknowledging changes with the passage of time and
			<lb />
			modern conceptions of public policy, it was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Not infrequently, in the nature of things there is a gravity-heavy
			<lb />
			inclination to follow the groove set by precedential law. Yet a sensitive
			<lb />
			judicial conscience often persuades the mind to search for a different set of
			<lb />
			norms more responsive to the changed social context. The dilemma before
			<lb />
			the Judge poses the task of finding a new equilibrium prompted not seldom
			<lb />
			by the desire to reconcile opposing mobilities. The competing goals,
			<lb />
			according to Dean Roscoe Pound, invest the Judge with the responsibility
			<lb />
			&quot;of proving to mankind that the law was something fixed and settled,
			<lb />
			whose authority was beyond question, while at the same time enabling it to
			<lb />
			make constant readjustments and occasional radical changes under the
			<lb />
			pressure of infinite and variable human desires&quot;. The reconciliation
			<lb />
			suggested by Lord Reid in The Judge as Law Maker lies in keeping both
			<lb />
			objectives in view, &quot;that the law shall be certain, and that it shall be just
			<lb />
			and shall move with the times&quot;.&quot; 449 (Internal citations have been omitted).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			256. In Gannon Dunkerley &amp; Co. v. State of Rajasthan 450 the question
			<lb />
			related to &apos;the imposition of tax on the transfer of property in goods involved
			<lb />
			in the execution of works contracts. The power to impose this tax became
			<lb />
			available to the State Legislatures as a result of the amendments introduced
			<lb />
			in the Constitution by the Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1982.&apos;
			<lb />
			The constitutional validity of this Amendment Act had been upheld in
			<lb />
			Builders&apos; Association of India v. Union of India. 451 One of the issues raised
			<lb />
			was whether Builders&apos; Association had been correctly decided or not. This
			<lb />
			Court did not add to the discourse on the subject but concluded, relying upon
			<lb />
			Khajoor Singh, Keshav Mills and Ganga Sugar Corporation that there was
			<lb />
			no occasion to reconsider the decision in Builders&apos; Association.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			257. Another decision (which is rather interesting) on the subject of
			<lb />
			reconsideration of an earlier decision is Pradeep Kumar Biswas v. Indian
			<lb />
			Institute of Chemical Biology. 452 The question before this Court was
			<lb />
			whether the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research was &apos;the State&apos; as
			<lb />
			&apos;defined&apos; in Article 12 of the Constitution. The answer to this question
			<lb />
			required consideration of an earlier unanimous decision of this Court in
			<lb />
			Sabhajit Tewary v. Union of India 453 which had stood undisturbed for about
			<lb />
			25 years. While answering this question, this Court did not detail the law on
			<lb />
			the subject of reconsideration of an earlier decision of this Court, but on a
			<lb />
			consideration of the facts (and the law) concluded that Sabhajit Tewary had
			<lb />
			been wrongly decided and was overruled. This Court referred to Maganlal
			<lb />
			Chhaganlal and Raghubir Singh and held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;From whichever perspective the facts are considered, there can be no
			<lb />
			doubt that the conclusion reached in Sabhajit Tewary was erroneous. …….
			<lb />
			In the assessment of the facts, the Court had assumed certain principles,
			<lb />
			and sought precedential support from decisions which were irrelevant and
			<lb />
			had &quot;followed a groove chased amidst a context which has long since
			<lb />
			crumbled.&quot; 454 Had the facts been closely scrutinised in the proper
			<lb />
			perspective, it could have led and can only lead to the conclusion that
			<lb />
			CSIR is a State within the meaning of Article 12.
			<lb />
			Should Sabhajit Tewary still stand as an authority even on the facts merely
			<lb />
			because it has stood for 25 years? We think not. Parallels may be drawn
			<lb />
			even on the facts leading to an untenable interpretation of Article 12 and a
			<lb />
			452 (2002) 5 SCC 111 (7 Judges Bench)
			<lb />
			453 (1975) 1 SCC 485 (5 Judges Bench)
			<lb />
			454 Sabhajit Tewary was a unanimous decision of 5 learned judges of this Court. To
			<lb />
			conclude that it &quot;sought precedential support from decisions which were irrelevant&quot;
			<lb />
			is, with respect, rather uncharitable.

			<lb />
			consequential denial of the benefits of fundamental rights to individuals
			<lb />
			who would otherwise be entitled to them and
			<lb />
			&quot;[T]here is nothing in our Constitution which prevents us from
			<lb />
			departing from a previous decision if we are convinced of its error and
			<lb />
			its baneful effect on the general interests of the public&quot;.
			<lb />
			Since on a re-examination of the question we have come to the conclusion
			<lb />
			that the decision was plainly erroneous, it is our duty to say so and not
			<lb />
			perpetuate our mistake.&quot; 455 (Internal citations have been omitted).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			258. One of the more interesting aspects of Pradeep Kumar Biswas is that
			<lb />
			out of the 7 (seven) learned judges constituting the Bench, 5 learned judges
			<lb />
			overruled the unanimous decision of another set of 5 learned judges in
			<lb />
			Sabhajit Tewary. Two of the learned judges in Pradeep Kumar Biswas
			<lb />
			found that Sabhajit Tewary had been correctly decided. In other words,
			<lb />
			while a total of 7 learned judges took a particular view on an issue of fact
			<lb />
			and law, that view was found to be incorrect by 5 learned judges, whose
			<lb />
			decision actually holds the field today. Is the weight of numbers irrelevant?
			<lb />
			Is it that only the numbers in a subsequent Bench are what really matters?
			<lb />
			What would have been the position if only 4 learned judges in Pradeep
			<lb />
			Kumar Biswas had decided to overrule Sabhajit Tewary while the remaining
			<lb />
			3 learned judges found no error in that decision? Would a decision rendered
			<lb />
			unanimously by a Bench of 5 learned judges stand overruled by the decision
			<lb />
			of 4 learned judges in a subsequent Bench of 7 learned judges? Pradeep
			<lb />
			Kumar Biswas presents a rather anomalous situation which needs to be
			<lb />
			addressed by appropriate rules of procedure. If this anomaly is perpetuated
			<lb />
			then the unanimous decision of 9 learned judges in the Third Judges case
			<lb />
			can be overruled (as sought by the learned Attorney-General) by 6 learned
			<lb />
			judges in a Bench of 11 learned judges, with 5 of them taking a different
			<lb />
			view, bringing the total tally of judges having one view to 14 and having
			<lb />
			another view to 6, with the view of the 6 learned judges being taken as the
			<lb />
			law!
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			259. Be that as it may, two other decisions of importance on the subject of
			<lb />
			reconsidering a prior decision of this Court are Kesavananda Bharati and
			<lb />
			the Second Judges case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			260. In Kesavananda Bharati it was pithily stated by Chief Justice S.M.
			<lb />
			Sikri that the question before the Court was whether Golak Nath was
			<lb />
			correctly decided. The learned Chief Justice observed:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;However, as I see it, the question whether Golak Nath case was rightly
			<lb />
			decided or not does not matter because the real issue is different and of
			<lb />
			much greater importance, the issue being: what is the extent of the
			<lb />
			amending power conferred by Article 368 of the Constitution, apart from
			<lb />
			Article 13(2), on Parliament ?&quot; 456
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			261. It follows from this that where a matter is of &apos;great importance&apos;, this
			<lb />
			Court may refer the issue to a larger Bench to reconsider an earlier decision
			<lb />
			of this Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			262. In the Second Judges case it was observed by Justice Pandian that an
			<lb />
			earlier decision rendered by this Court may be reconsidered if, amongst
			<lb />
			others, &apos;exceptional and extraordinarily compelling&apos; circumstances so
			<lb />
			warrant. It was observed that &apos;no decision enjoys absolute immunity from
			<lb />
			judicial review or reconsideration on a fresh outlook of the constitutional or
			<lb />
			legal interpretation and in the light of the development of innovative ideas,
			<lb />
			principles and perception grown along with the passage of time.&apos; 457 Recalling
			<lb />
			the observations in Maganlal Chhaganlal, Raghubir Singh and Pradeep
			<lb />
			Kumar Biswas it was held that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Therefore, in exceptional and extraordinarily compelling circumstances
			<lb />
			or under new set of conditions, the court is on a fresh outlook and in the
			<lb />
			light of the development of innovative ideas, principles and perception
			<lb />
			grown along with the passage of time, obliged by legal and moral forces to
			<lb />
			reconsider its earlier ruling or decision and if necessitated even to overrule
			<lb />
			or reverse the mistaken decision by the application of the &apos;principle of
			<lb />
			retroactive invalidity&apos;. Otherwise even the wrong judicial interpretation
			<lb />
			that the Constitution or law has received over decades will be holding the
			<lb />
			field for ages to come without that wrong being corrected. Indeed, no
			<lb />
			historic precedent and long-term practice can supply a rule of unalterable
			<lb />
			decision.&quot; 458
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			263. There is absolutely no dispute or doubt that this Court can reconsider
			<lb />
			(and set aside) an earlier decision rendered by it. But what are the
			<lb />
			circumstances under which the reconsideration can be sought? This Court
			<lb />
			has debated and discussed the issue on several occasions as mentioned above
			<lb />
			and the broad principles that can be culled out from the various decisions
			<lb />
			suggest that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(1) If the decision concerns an interpretation of the Constitution,
			<lb />
			perhaps the bar for reconsideration might be lowered a bit (as in
			<lb />
			Kesavananda Bharati). Although the remedy of amending the Constitution
			<lb />
			is available to Parliament, not all amendments are easy to carry out. Some
			<lb />
			amendments require following the procedure of ratification by the States.
			<lb />
			Nevertheless, where a constitutional issue is involved, the necessity of
			<lb />
			reconsideration should be shown beyond all reasonable doubt, the remedy of
			<lb />
			amending the Constitution always being available to Parliament.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(2) If the decision concerns the imposition of a tax, then too the bar
			<lb />
			might be lowered a bit since the tax burden would affect a large section of
			<lb />
			the public. However, the general principles for requiring reconsideration do
			<lb />
			not necessarily fall by the wayside.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(3) If the decision concerns the fundamental rights of the people, then
			<lb />
			too the bar might be lowered for obvious reasons. However again, the
			<lb />
			general principles for requiring reconsideration must be adhered to.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(4) In other cases, the Court must be convinced that the earlier
			<lb />
			decision is plainly erroneous and has a baneful effect on the public; that it is
			<lb />
			vague or inconsistent or manifestly wrong.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(5) If the decision only concerns two contending private parties or
			<lb />
			individuals, then perhaps it might not be advisable to reconsider it. Each and
			<lb />
			every error of law cannot obviously be corrected by this Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(6) The power to reconsider is not unrestricted or unlimited, but is
			<lb />
			confined within narrow limits and must be exercised sparingly and under
			<lb />
			exceptional circumstances for clear and compelling reasons. Therefore,
			<lb />
			merely because a view different from or contrary to what has been expressed
			<lb />
			earlier is preferable is no reason to reconsider an earlier decision. The
			<lb />
			endeavour of this Court must always be to ensure that the law is definite and
			<lb />
			certain and continuity in the interpretation of the law is maintained.
			<lb />
			In this regard, Raghubir Singh presents an interesting picture. Section
			<lb />
			23(2) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (as amended in 1984) was
			<lb />
			interpreted by this Court on 14 th February, 1985 in K.
			<lb />
			Kamalajammanniavaru v. Special Land Acquisition Officer. 459 That
			<lb />
			decision was overruled six months later on 14 th August, 1985 in Bhag Singh
			<lb />
			v. Union Territory of Chandigarh. 460 That decision was in turn overruled on
			<lb />
			16 th May, 1989 in Raghubir Singh and the law laid in
			<lb />
			Kamalajammanniavaru was reiterated. It is this uncertainly and absence of
			<lb />
			continuity in the law that is required to be avoided.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(7) An earlier decision may be reconsidered if a material provision of
			<lb />
			law is overlooked 461 or a fundamental assumption is found to be erroneous or
			<lb />
			if there are valid and compulsive or compelling reasons or if the issue is of
			<lb />
			fundamental importance to national life. However, it might not be wise to
			<lb />
			overrule a decision if people have changed their position on the basis of the
			<lb />
			existing law. This is because it might upset the legitimate expectation of
			<lb />
			persons who have made arrangements based on the earlier decision and also
			<lb />
			because the consequences of such a decision might not be foreseeable.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(8) Whether a decision has held the field for a long time or not is not
			<lb />
			of much consequence. In Bengal Immunity a recent decision delivered by
			<lb />
			the Constitution Bench was overruled; in Pradeep Kumar Biswas a decision
			<lb />
			holding the field for a quarter of a century was overruled.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(9) Significantly, this Court has taken note of and approved the view
			<lb />
			that the changing times might require the interpretation of the law to be
			<lb />
			readjusted keeping in mind the &apos;infinite and variable human desires&apos; and
			<lb />
			changed conditions due to &apos;development with the progress of years.&apos; The
			<lb />
			interpretation of the law, valid for one generation may not necessarily be
			<lb />
			valid for subsequent generations. This is a reality that ought to be
			<lb />
			acknowledged as has been done by this Court in Maganlal Chhaganlal and
			<lb />
			by Chief Justice Dickson of the Canadian Supreme Court in The Queen v.
			<lb />
			Beauregard. 462 Similarly, the social context or &apos;contemporary social
			<lb />
			conditions or modern conceptions of public policy&apos; cannot be overlooked.
			<lb />
			Oliver Wendell Holmes later a judge of the Supreme Court of the United
			<lb />
			States put it
			<lb />
			rather pithily when he said that: &apos;But the present has a right to govern itself
			<lb />
			so far as it can; and it ought always to be remembered that historic continuity
			<lb />
			with the past is not a duty, it is only a necessity.&apos; 463
			<lb />
			462 [1986] 2 SCR 56 wherein it is stated: With respect to the first of these arguments, I do not think s.100 [of
			<lb />
			the Constitution Act, 1867] imposes on Parliament the duty to continue to provide judges with precisely the
			<lb />
			same type of pension they received in 1867. The Canadian Constitution is not locked forever in a 119-year old
			<lb />
			casket. It lives and breathes and is capable of growing to keep pace with the growth of the country and its
			<lb />
			people. Accordingly, if the Constitution can accommodate, as it has, many subjects unknown in
			<lb />
			1867--airplanes, nuclear energy, hydroelectric power--it is surely not straining s. 100 too much to say that the
			<lb />
			word `pensions&apos;, admittedly understood in one sense in 1867, can today support federal legislation based on a
			<lb />
			different understanding of `pensions&apos;.
			<lb />
			463 &quot;The law, so far as it depends on learning, is indeed, as it has been called, the government of the living
			<lb />
			by the dead. To a very considerable extent no doubt it is inevitable that the living should be so governed.
			<lb />
			The past gives us our vocabulary and fixes the limits of our imagination; we cannot get away from it. There
			<lb />
			is, too, a peculiar logical pleasure in making manifest the continuity between what we are doing and what
			<lb />
			has been done before. But the present has a right to govern itself so far as it can; and it ought always to be
			<lb />
			remembered that historic continuity with the past is not a duty, it is only a necessity.&quot;

			<lb />
			Page 727
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			264. It is trite that the Constitution is a living document 464 and it is also wise
			<lb />
			to remember, in this context, what was said in R.C. Poudyal v. Union of
			<lb />
			India 465 that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;In the interpretation of a constitutional document, &apos;words are but the
			<lb />
			framework of concepts and concepts may change more than words
			<lb />
			themselves&apos;. The significance of the change of the concepts themselves is
			<lb />
			vital and the constitutional issues are not solved by a mere appeal to the
			<lb />
			meaning of the words without an acceptance of the line of their growth. It
			<lb />
			is aptly said that &apos;the intention of a Constitution is rather to outline
			<lb />
			principles than to engrave details&apos;.&quot; 466
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			265. On the basis of the law as laid down by this Court and considering the
			<lb />
			historical developments over the last six decades, it was submitted by the
			<lb />
			learned Attorney-General that a fundamental and significant question as to
			<lb />
			the interpretation of the Constitution has arisen; that the Second Judges case
			<lb />
			and the Third Judges case did not correctly appreciate the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly Debates on the Judiciary and that the time has now come to make
			<lb />
			a course correction.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Conclusions on the preliminary issue
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			266. It is quite clear that there is a distribution of power through a system
			<lb />
			of checks and balances rather than a classical separation of power between
			<lb />
			the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. These three organs of the
			<lb />
			State are not in a silo and therefore there is an occasional overlap -but every
			<lb />
			overlap does not necessarily lead to a violation of the separation of powers
			<lb />
			theory. 467
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			267. There are several examples of this &apos;overlap&apos; and the learned
			<lb />
			Attorney-General has taken us through the various provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution in this regard: Article 124(1) of the Constitution enables
			<lb />
			Parliament to pass a law prescribing the composition of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			as consisting of more than seven judges. Pursuant to this the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			(Number of Judges) Act, 1956 was passed; Article 124(4) provides for the
			<lb />
			impeachment process for the removal of a judge; Article 124(5) enables
			<lb />
			Parliament to legislate for regulating the procedure for the presentation of an
			<lb />
			address in the impeachment process and in the investigation and proof of the
			<lb />
			misbehavior or incapacity of a judge; Article 125(1) enables Parliament by
			<lb />
			law to determine the salary of a judge while Article 125(2) enables
			<lb />
			Parliament to pass a law with regard to the privileges, allowances, etc. of a
			<lb />
			judge. Pursuant to this the Supreme Court Judges (Conditions of Service)
			<lb />
			Act, 1958 has been enacted; Article 134(2) enables Parliament to confer on
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court by legislation, further powers to entertain and hear
			<lb />
			appeals and criminal proceedings. Pursuant to this, Parliament has enacted
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act,
			<lb />
			1970; Article 135 enables Parliament to make a law with regard to the
			<lb />
			jurisdiction and power of the Supreme Court with respect of any matter to
			<lb />
			which the provisions of Article 133 and Article 134 do not apply; Article 137
			<lb />
			provides that subject to any law made by Parliament the Supreme Court shall
			<lb />
			have the power to review any judgment pronounced or order made by it;
			<lb />
			Article 138 enables Parliament by law to enlarge the jurisdiction of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court with respect to any matter as the Government of India and
			<lb />
			the Government of any State may by special agreement confer and Article
			<lb />
			139 enables Parliament to make a law to issue writs other than those
			<lb />
			mentioned in Article 32 of the Constitution; Article 140 enables Parliament
			<lb />
			to make a law conferring upon the Supreme Court supplementary powers;
			<lb />
			Article 142 enables Parliament to make a law for the enforcement of a decree
			<lb />
			or order of the Supreme Court and the exercise of power by the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court to make any order for the purpose of securing the attendance of any
			<lb />
			person, the discovery or production of any documents, or the investigation or
			<lb />
			punishment of any contempt, Article 145 enables Parliament to make any
			<lb />
			law for regulating the practice and procedure of Supreme Court while Article
			<lb />
			146(2) enables Parliament to lay down the conditions of service of officers
			<lb />
			and servants of the Supreme Court. Article 130 of the Constitution permits
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court to sit at any place other than Delhi with the approval of
			<lb />
			the President while Article 145 enables the Supreme Court to make rules for
			<lb />
			regulating the practice and procedure of the Court with the approval of the
			<lb />
			President.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			268. There is quite clearly an entire host of parliamentary and legislative
			<lb />
			checks placed on the judiciary whereby its administrative functioning can be
			<lb />
			and is controlled, but these do not necessarily violate the theory of separation
			<lb />
			of powers or infringe the independence of the judiciary as far as decision
			<lb />
			making is concerned. As has been repeatedly held, the theory of separation
			<lb />
			of powers is not rigidly implemented in our Constitution, but if there is an
			<lb />
			overlap in the form of a check with reference to an essential or a basic
			<lb />
			function or element of one organ of State as against another, a constitutional
			<lb />
			issue does arise. It is in this context that the 99 th Constitution Amendment
			<lb />
			Act has to be viewed -whether it impacts on a basic or an essential element
			<lb />
			of the independence of the judiciary, namely, its decisional independence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			269. The learned Attorney-General is not right in his submission that the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case overlooked the separation of powers and the CAD and
			<lb />
			incorrectly interpreted the provisions of the Constitution particularly Article
			<lb />
			124(2) thereof. This is a rather narrow understanding of the Second Judges
			<lb />
			case which, amongst others, considered the interpretation of Article 50 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, constitutional history and conventions, the entire spectrum of
			<lb />
			issues relating to the appointment of judges in the context of the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary, transparency and sharing of information
			<lb />
			between the constitutional authorities, the primacy of the President or the
			<lb />
			Judiciary in the appointment process (depending on the circumstances), the
			<lb />
			importance of the President in the integrated consultative process derived
			<lb />
			from the debates in the Constituent Assembly and several other related
			<lb />
			aspects. All this involved a pragmatic and workable interpretation of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, which is the task only of the judiciary and there can be no
			<lb />
			doubt about this. This was pithily stated in Marbury v. Madison 468 : &apos;It is
			<lb />
			emphatically the province and duty of the Judicial Department to say what
			<lb />
			the law is.&apos; It was also explicitly held in Re: Powers, Privileges and
			<lb />
			Immunities of State Legislatures 469 where it was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;[W]hether or not there is distinct and rigid separation of powers under the
			<lb />
			Indian Constitution, there is no doubt that the Constitution has entrusted to
			<lb />
			the Judicature in this country the task of construing the provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution and of safeguarding the fundamental rights of the citizens.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			When a statute is challenged on the ground that it has been passed by a
			<lb />
			legislature without authority, or has otherwise unconstitutionally
			<lb />
			trespassed on fundamental rights, it is for the courts to determine the
			<lb />
			dispute and decide whether the law passed by the legislature is valid or
			<lb />
			not. Just as the legislatures are conferred legislative authority and their
			<lb />
			functions are normally confined to legislative functions, and the functions
			<lb />
			and authority of the executive lie within the domain of executive authority,
			<lb />
			so the jurisdiction and authority of the Judicature in this country lie within
			<lb />
			the domain of adjudication. If the validity of any law is challenged before
			<lb />
			the courts, it is never suggested that the material question as to whether
			<lb />
			legislative authority has been exceeded or fundamental rights have been
			<lb />
			contravened, can be decided by the legislatures themselves.&quot; 470
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			270. The learned Attorney-General is also not right in reducing the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case to only one aspect -the decision of this Court has to be
			<lb />
			appreciated as a part of the larger constitutional scheme relating to the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary. The learned Attorney-General may or may not
			<lb />
			agree with the interpretation given by this Court to the constitutional scheme
			<lb />
			but that is no indication that the theory of the separation of powers has
			<lb />
			broken down. If there is an interpretational error, it can be corrected only by
			<lb />
			the judiciary, or by a suitable amendment to the Constitution that does not
			<lb />
			violate its basic structure.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			271. No one thought that this Court, in the Second Judges case, had
			<lb />
			erroneously interpreted or misunderstood the constitutional scheme
			<lb />
			concerning the appointment of judges and the independence of the judiciary.
			<lb />
			There were some problem areas and these were referred to this Court in the
			<lb />
			form of questions raised by the President seeking the advisory opinion of this
			<lb />
			Court in the Third Judges case. The correctness of the decision rendered in
			<lb />
			the Second Judges case was not in doubt and to remove any
			<lb />
			misunderstanding in this regard the learned Attorney-General categorically
			<lb />
			stated in the Third Judges case that &apos;the Union of India is not seeking a
			<lb />
			review or reconsideration of the judgment in the Second Judges case.&apos;
			<lb />
			Therefore, neither the President nor the Union of India nor anybody else for
			<lb />
			that matter sought a reconsideration of the Second Judges case. There is no
			<lb />
			reason (apart from an absence of a reason at law) why such a request should
			<lb />
			be entertained at this stage, except on a fanciful misunderstanding of the law
			<lb />
			by the Union of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			272. The contention of the learned Attorney-General is that the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court or a High Court is an executive
			<lb />
			function and that has been taken over by the judiciary by a process of
			<lb />
			judicial encroachment through a &apos;right to insist&apos; thereby breaking down the
			<lb />
			separation of power theory. It is not possible to accept this line of thought.
			<lb />
			The appointment of a judge is an executive function of the President and it
			<lb />
			continues to be so. However, the constitutional convention established even
			<lb />
			before Independence has been that a judge is appointed only if the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India or the Chief Justice of the High Court gives his/her nod to
			<lb />
			the appointment. This position continued even after Independence. Justice
			<lb />
			Kuldip Singh summarized the appointments position in the Second Judges
			<lb />
			case in the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;(i) The executive had absolute power to appoint the Judges under the
			<lb />
			Government of India Act, 1935. Despite that all the appointments made
			<lb />
			thereunder were made with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) A convention had come to be established by the year 1948 that
			<lb />
			appointment of a Judge could only be made with the concurrence of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii) All the appointments to the Supreme Court from 1950 to 1959 were
			<lb />
			made with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India. 210 out of 211
			<lb />
			appointments made to the High Courts during that period were also with
			<lb />
			the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iv) Mr Gobind Ballabh Pant, Home Minister of India, declared on the
			<lb />
			floor of the Parliament on November 24, 1959 that appointment of Judges
			<lb />
			were virtually being made by the Chief Justice of India and the executive
			<lb />
			was only an order-issuing authority.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(v) Mr Ashoke Sen, the Law Minister reiterated in the Parliament on
			<lb />
			November 25, 1959 that almost all the appointments made to the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court and the High Courts were made with the concurrence of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iv) Out of 547 appointments of Judges made during the period January 1,
			<lb />
			1983 to April 10, 1993 only 7 were not in consonance with the views
			<lb />
			expressed by the Chief Justice of India.&quot; 471
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			273. These facts and figures clearly indicate that at least since 1935, if not
			<lb />
			earlier, the appointment of judges was made in accordance with the view of
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India or the Chief Justice of the High Court as the case
			<lb />
			may be. There were aberrations but these appear to have mainly taken place
			<lb />
			only after Independence, as mentioned above. But even in those cases where
			<lb />
			there were aberrations pre-1959 (with the Chief Justice of the High Court
			<lb />
			having been by-passed) the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India was
			<lb />
			taken. The executive, therefore, never had real primacy in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of judges. But, post the First Judges case the executive exerted
			<lb />
			its newly given absolute primacy in the appointment of judges and the
			<lb />
			aberrations increased. Surely, the executive cannot take advantage of the
			<lb />
			aberrations caused at its instance and then employ them as an argument that
			<lb />
			no constitutional convention existed regarding the concurrence of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India. On the contrary, the aberrations indicate the stealthy attempt
			<lb />
			of the political executive to subvert the independence of the judiciary
			<lb />
			through appointments that were not necessarily merit-based, and the
			<lb />
			submissions advanced before us suggest that henceforth the independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary may not necessarily be sacrosanct. It is for this reason that the
			<lb />
			Bar has fought back to preserve and protect the existing conventions and
			<lb />
			practices and will, hopefully maintain its vigil.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			274. In The Pocket Veto case 472 the US Supreme Court referred to a long
			<lb />
			standing practice as an interpretation to a constitutional provision, which
			<lb />
			would be equally applicable to India. It was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The views which we have expressed as to the construction and effect of
			<lb />
			the constitutional provision here in question are confirmed by the practical
			<lb />
			construction that has been given to it by the Presidents through a long
			<lb />
			course of years, in which Congress has acquiesced. Long settled and
			<lb />
			established practice is a consideration of great weight in a proper
			<lb />
			interpretation of constitutional provisions of this character. Compare
			<lb />
			Missouri Pac. Ry. Co. v. Kansas 473 ; Myers v. United States 474 ; and State v.
			<lb />
			South Norwalk 475 in which the court said that a practice of at least twenty
			<lb />
			years&apos; duration on the part of the executive department, acquiesced in by
			<lb />
			the legislative department, while not absolutely binding on the judicial
			<lb />
			department, is entitled to great regard in determining the true construction
			<lb />
			of a constitutional provision the phraseology of which is in any respect of
			<lb />
			doubtful meaning.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			275. By claiming absolute executive primacy, the learned Attorney-General
			<lb />
			is, in effect, propagating the view that the President can exercise a veto on
			<lb />
			the proposal to appoint a judge, even if that proposal has the approval of all
			<lb />
			other constitutional authorities. Such a view was not acceptable to Dr.
			<lb />
			Ambedkar and the Constituent Assembly and it is impermissible to introduce
			<lb />
			it through the back door. The Chief Justice of India has no &apos;right to insist&apos; on
			<lb />
			an appointment nor does the President have the &apos;right to reject&apos; or a veto. The
			<lb />
			Constitution postulates a consultative and participatory process between the
			<lb />
			constitutional functionaries for appointing the &apos;best&apos; possible person as a
			<lb />
			judge of a High Court or the Supreme Court. In this consultative process the
			<lb />
			final word is given, by a constitutional convention and practice developed
			<lb />
			over the years, to the Chief Justice of India since that constitutional
			<lb />
			functionary is best equipped to appreciate the requirements of effective
			<lb />
			justice delivery, to maintain the independence of the judiciary, to keep at bay
			<lb />
			external influences, &apos;eliminate political influence even at the stage of initial
			<lb />
			appointment of a Judge&apos; 476 and as the head of the judiciary, his/her judgment
			<lb />
			ought to be trusted in this regard. That this could be characterized as a &apos;right
			<lb />
			to insist&apos; is not at all justified, nor can any voice of disagreement by the
			<lb />
			executive be construed as a &apos;right to reject&apos; or a veto. These expressions do
			<lb />
			not gel with the constitutional scheme or the responsibilities of constitutional
			<lb />
			functionaries.
			<lb />

			276. What did the Second Judges case and the Third Judges case decide
			<lb />
			that should lead the political executive to misunderstand the views expressed
			<lb />
			and misunderstand the law interpreted or call for a reconsideration of the law
			<lb />
			laid down? In essence, all that was decided was that the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India (in an individual capacity) could not recommend a person for
			<lb />
			appointment as a judge, but must do so in consultation with the other judges
			<lb />
			(and if necessary with non-judges). Such a recommendation of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India, if made unanimously, ought normally to be accepted by the
			<lb />
			President. However, the President can return the recommendation for
			<lb />
			reconsideration for strong and cogent reasons. If the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			(in consultation with the other judges and unanimously) reiterates the
			<lb />
			recommendation, it should be accepted. On the other hand, a
			<lb />
			recommendation made by the Chief Justice of India, which is initially not
			<lb />
			unanimous, may not be accepted by the President. As pointed out by Justice
			<lb />
			Verma, the President occasionally failed to exercise this particular
			<lb />
			constitutional power, for unknown reasons or due to a misunderstanding of
			<lb />
			the dicta laid down by this Court. The path taken by this Court was in
			<lb />
			consonance with the views of the Constituent Assembly, in that in the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges, no constitutional functionary could act in an
			<lb />
			individual capacity but the Chief Justice of India and other judges were well
			<lb />
			qualified to give the correct advice to the President in a matter of this sort,
			<lb />
			and that ought to be accepted as long as it was unanimous.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			277. The debate on 24 th May, 1949 discloses that a variety of options were
			<lb />
			available before the Constituent Assembly with regard to the procedure for
			<lb />
			the appointment of judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			278. One of the available methods was to have the appointment of a judge
			<lb />
			approved by the Council of State. This was opposed by Mr. R.K. Sidhwa
			<lb />
			(C.P. &amp; Berar: General) who was of the opinion that if the appointment is left
			<lb />
			to the Council of State then there is a possibility of canvassing in which
			<lb />
			event the issue of ability etc. of a person recommended for appointment as a
			<lb />
			judge will cease to be relevant. Mr. Sidhwa was of the opinion that this
			<lb />
			method would be the same as an election, although Prof. K.T. Shah thought
			<lb />
			otherwise. The proposal was also opposed by Mr. Biswanath Das (Orissa:
			<lb />
			General) who referred to this method of appointment as laying down a very
			<lb />
			dangerous principle.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			279. Another method of appointment discussed was to leave the process
			<lb />
			entirely to the President. Mr. Rohini Kumar Chaudhari (Assam: General)
			<lb />
			apparently supported that view and went on to suggest that the amendment
			<lb />
			proposed by Dr. Ambedkar for deletion of consultation by the President with
			<lb />
			judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court should be accepted. He
			<lb />
			was of the opinion that the matter should be dealt with only by the President
			<lb />
			who could consult anybody, why only judges of the Supreme Court and the
			<lb />
			High Court. If the President knew a person to be of outstanding ability, it
			<lb />
			might not be necessary for him/her to consult anybody for making the
			<lb />
			appointment. This view was supported by Mr. M. Ananthasayanam
			<lb />
			Ayyangar (Madras: General) who also felt that it should be left to the
			<lb />
			President to decide whom to consult, if necessary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			280. Yet another method of appointment was the British system where
			<lb />
			appointments were made by the Crown without any kind of limitation
			<lb />
			whatsoever, that is, by the political executive. A fourth method discussed
			<lb />
			was that prevailing in the United States where appointments were made with
			<lb />
			the concurrence of the Senate.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			281. Dr. Ambedkar was of the view that none of the methods proposed was
			<lb />
			suitable for a variety of reasons and therefore a middle path was taken which
			<lb />
			required the President to consult the Chief Justice of India and other judges.
			<lb />
			Dr. Ambedkar felt that consultation with the Chief Justice of India and other
			<lb />
			judges was necessary since they were ex hypothesi well qualified to give
			<lb />
			advice in a matter of this nature.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			282. The Chief Justice of India and other judges are undoubtedly well
			<lb />
			qualified to give proper advice with regard to the knowledge, ability,
			<lb />
			competence and suitability of a person to be appointed as a judge of a High
			<lb />
			Court of the Supreme Court. There is no reason, therefore, why the opinion
			<lb />
			of the Chief Justice of India taken along with the opinion of other judges
			<lb />
			should not be accepted by the executive, which is certainly not better
			<lb />
			qualified to make an assessment in this regard. However, it is possible that
			<lb />
			the executive may be in possession of some information about some aspect
			<lb />
			of a particular person which may not be known to the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			and as postulated in Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth and in the Second Judges
			<lb />
			case the entire material should be made available to the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India leaving it to him/her to decide whether the person recommended for
			<lb />
			appointment meets the requirement for being appointed a judge or not,
			<lb />
			despite any antecedents, peculiarities and angularities. If the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India and others with whom he/she has discussed the matter conclude -
			<lb />
			unanimously -that the person ought to be appointed as a judge of a High
			<lb />
			Court or the Supreme Court despite the antecedents, peculiarities and
			<lb />
			angularities, there can be no earthly reason why that collective view should
			<lb />
			not be accepted. The Chief Justice of India is in a sense the captain of the
			<lb />
			ship as far as the judiciary is concerned and his/her opinion (obtained
			<lb />
			collectively and unanimously) should be accepted rather than the opinion of
			<lb />
			someone who is a passenger (though an important one) in the ship. Dr.
			<lb />
			Ambedkar was of the confirmed view that the judiciary should be
			<lb />
			independent and impartial and if the Chief Justice of India does not have the
			<lb />
			final say in the matter then the judiciary is, in a sense, under some other
			<lb />
			authority and therefore not independent to that extent. This would be a
			<lb />
			rejection of the views of Dr. Ambedkar and a negation of the views of the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			283. From the debates of the Constituent Assembly it is evident that Dr.
			<lb />
			Ambedkar&apos;s objection was to the suggestion that only the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India (as an individual) should have the final say in the matter. There is
			<lb />
			nothing to suggest that the Constituent Assembly had any objection to an
			<lb />
			integrated consultative participatory process as mentioned in the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case and the Third Judges case or, as Dr. Rajeev Dhavan described
			<lb />
			it as &apos;institutional participation&apos; in the matter of appointment of judges. The
			<lb />
			objection only was to one person (the President or the Chief Justice of India)
			<lb />
			having a final say in the matter and that one person (the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India) could possibly suffer from the same frailties as any one of us and this
			<lb />
			is what Dr. Ambedkar sought to emphasize in his objection. It must be
			<lb />
			appreciated that when the debate took place (on 24 th May, 1949) the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges was, due to the insertion of clause (5)a in Article 62 of
			<lb />
			the Draft Constitution 477 considered to be the responsibility of the President
			<lb />
			acting on his own and not through the Council of Ministers. That this theory
			<lb />
			was in the process of being given up (and was actually given up) is a
			<lb />
			different matter altogether. Alternatively, if the thinking at that time was that
			<lb />
			the President was to act only the advice of the Council of Ministers (and not
			<lb />
			as an individual having unfettered discretion) there can today possibly be no
			<lb />
			objection to the Chief Justice of India acting institutionally on the views of
			<lb />
			his/her colleagues and not, as desired by Dr. Ambedkar, as an individual. In
			<lb />
			other words, constitutionalism in India has undergone a positive
			<lb />
			transformation and the objection that Dr. Ambedkar had to any individual
			<lb />
			477 Clause 5(a) of Article 62 reads:
			<lb />
			&quot;(5)a In the choice of his Ministers and the exercise of his other functions under this Constitution,
			<lb />
			the President shall be generally guided by the instructions set out in Schedule III-A, but the validity of
			<lb />
			anything done by the President shall not be called in question on the ground that it was done otherwise than
			<lb />
			in accordance with such instructions.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Page 741
			<lb />
			having the final say is rendered non-existent. In view of Samsher Singh the
			<lb />
			President cannot act in an individual capacity (except to a limited extent) and
			<lb />
			in view of the Second Judges case and the Third Judges case the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India cannot act in an individual capacity (except to a limited
			<lb />
			extent). The Constitution being an organic and living document must be and
			<lb />
			has been interpreted positively and meaningfully.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			284. It is this philosophy, of the Constitution being an organic and living
			<lb />
			document that ought to be positively and meaningfully interpreted, that is to
			<lb />
			be found in Samsher Singh. It is this constructive interpretation read with
			<lb />
			the CAD that made the advice of the Council of Ministers binding on the
			<lb />
			President and not a &apos;take it or leave it&apos; advice. Similarly, &apos;consultation&apos; with
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India has to be understood in this light and not as a
			<lb />
			&apos;consulted and opinion rejected&apos; situation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			285. It is not correct to suggest, as did the learned Attorney-General, that
			<lb />
			the theory of separation of powers in the Constitution has been torpedoed by
			<lb />
			the interpretation given to Article 124(2) of the Constitution in the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case. On the contrary, the constitutional convention, the
			<lb />
			constitutional scheme and the constitutional practice recognize the
			<lb />
			responsibility of the judiciary in the appointment of judges and this was
			<lb />
			merely formalized in the Second Judges case. The theory of the separation
			<lb />
			of powers or the distribution of powers was maintained by the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case rather than thrown overboard. To rephrase Justice Jackson of the
			<lb />
			US Supreme Court in Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer 478 the
			<lb />
			Constitution enjoins upon its branches &apos;separateness but interdependence,
			<lb />
			autonomy but reciprocity&apos; and the Second Judges case has effectively
			<lb />
			maintained this equilibrium between the judiciary and the political executive,
			<lb />
			keeping the independence of the judiciary in mind, including the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			286. Taking all these factors and the CAD into account, all of which were
			<lb />
			discussed in the Second Judges case it is difficult to accept the contention of
			<lb />
			the learned Attorney General that the Second Judges case requires
			<lb />
			reconsideration on merits. While the various decisions referred to dealt with
			<lb />
			the issue of reconsideration of an earlier decision of this Court, it is difficult
			<lb />
			to conclude that a decision rendered by 8 out of 9 judges who decided the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case (Justice Punchhi also concurred on the primacy of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India) ought to be rejected only because there could be a
			<lb />
			change of opinion or a change of circumstances. The Second Judges case
			<lb />
			was accepted by the Attorney-General as mentioned in the Third Judges
			<lb />
			case and also by the President who did not raise any question about the
			<lb />
			interpretation given to Article 124(2) and Article 217(1) of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			These constitutional authorities having accepted the law laid down in the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case, there is no reason to reconsider that decision on the
			<lb />
			parameters repeatedly laid down by the Court. There are no exceptional
			<lb />
			circumstances, clear and compelling reasons for reconsideration, nor can it
			<lb />
			be said that the Second Judges case was plainly erroneous or that it has a
			<lb />
			baneful effect on the public. On the contrary, the decision restored the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary in real terms and eliminated the baneful effect
			<lb />
			of executive controls.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			287. It may also be mentioned that it was categorically laid down in
			<lb />
			Samsher Singh that the last word in matters pertaining to judiciary should be
			<lb />
			with the Chief Justice of India. Samsher Singh was decided by a Bench of
			<lb />
			seven learned judges and no one has said that that decision requires
			<lb />
			reconsideration or that it does not lay down the correct law. The Second
			<lb />
			Judges case merely reiterates the &apos;last word&apos; view in a limited sense.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			288. The consensus of opinion across the board is quite clear that the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case has been correctly decided and that the conventions and
			<lb />
			the principles laid down therein flow from our constitutional history and
			<lb />
			these do not need any reconsideration.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			289. This is not to say that the Second Judges case and the Third Judges
			<lb />
			case do not leave any gaps. Perhaps better institutionalization and fine tuning
			<lb />
			of the scheme laid down in these decisions is required, but nothing more.
			<lb />
			But, in view of the submission made by the learned Attorney-General that
			<lb />
			the only question for consideration is the constitutional validity of the 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act the issue of reconsideration
			<lb />
			becomes academic and it is not at all necessary at present to express any
			<lb />
			further view on this. By the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act the word
			<lb />
			&apos;consultation&apos; has been deleted from Article 124(2) and Article 217(1) of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. Therefore the question whether that word has been correctly
			<lb />
			interpreted in the Second Judges case or not is today completely academic.
			<lb />
			A new constitutional regime has been put in place and that has to be tested as
			<lb />
			it is. It is only if the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act is held as violating the
			<lb />
			basic structure of the Constitution and is declared unconstitutional that the
			<lb />
			fine tuning and filling in the gaps in the Second Judges case and the Third
			<lb />
			Judges case would arise.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			290. Hence the only question now is whether the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act violates the basic structure of the Constitution and to decide
			<lb />
			this question it is not necessary to reconsider the Second Judges case or the
			<lb />
			Third Judges case. This is apart from the fact that reconsideration is not
			<lb />
			warranted at law, even on merits.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Rule of Law
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			291. On the merits of the controversy before us, it is necessary to proceed
			<lb />
			on the basis that there is no doubt that the CAD, the Constitution and judicial
			<lb />
			pronouncements guarantee the independence of the judiciary. Does the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary include the appointment of a judge? According
			<lb />
			to the learned Attorney-General, the appointment of judges is a part of the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary, but not a predominant part.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			292. Before considering these issues, it is necessary to appreciate the role
			<lb />
			of the Rule of Law in our constitutional history. It has been said: &apos;Ultimately,
			<lb />
			it is the rule of law, not the judges, which provides the foundation for
			<lb />
			personal freedom and responsible government.&apos; 479
			<lb />
			293. The Rule of Law is recognized as a basic feature of our Constitution.
			<lb />
			It is in this context that the aphorism, &apos;Be you ever so high, the law is above
			<lb />
			you&apos; is acknowledged and implemented by the Judiciary. If the Rule of Law
			<lb />
			is a basic feature of our Constitution, so must be the independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary since the &apos;enforcement&apos; of the Rule of Law requires an independent
			<lb />
			judiciary as its integral and critical component.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			294. Justice Mathew concluded in Indira Nehru Gandhi that according to
			<lb />
			some judges constituting the majority in Kesavananda Bharati the Rule of
			<lb />
			Law is a basic structure of the Constitution. 480
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			295. In Samsher Singh the independence of the judiciary was held to be a
			<lb />
			cardinal principle of the Constitution by Justice Krishna Iyer speaking for
			<lb />
			himself and Justice Bhagwati. 481 That it is a part of the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution was unequivocally stated for the first time in the First Judges
			<lb />
			case by Justice Bhagwati, 482 by Justice Fazal Ali 483 and by Justice V.D.
			<lb />
			Tulzapurkar. 484
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			296. In the Second Judges case Justice Pandian expressed the view that
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary is &apos;inextricably linked and connected with the
			<lb />
			judicial process.&apos; 485 This was also the view expressed by Justice Kuldip
			<lb />
			Singh who held that the independence of the judiciary is a basic feature of
			<lb />
			the Constitution. 486 Justice J.S. Verma speaking for the majority and relying
			<lb />
			upon a few decisions held that the Rule of Law is a basic feature of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. 487 Similarly, Justice Punchhi (dissent) held that the Rule of Law
			<lb />
			is a basic feature of the Constitution and the independence of the judiciary is
			<lb />
			its essential attribute:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It is said that Rule of Law is a basic feature the Constitution permeating
			<lb />
			the whole constitutional fabric. I agree. Independence of the judiciary is an
			<lb />
			essential attribute of Rule of Law, and is part of the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. To this I also agree.&quot; 488
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			297. In Sub-Committee on Judicial Accountability v. Union of India 489 it
			<lb />
			was held by Justice B.C. Ray speaking for the majority that the Rule of Law
			<lb />
			is a basic feature of the Constitution and an independent judiciary is an
			<lb />
			essential attribute thereof. It was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Before we discuss the merits of the arguments it is necessary to take a
			<lb />
			conspectus of the constitutional provisions concerning the judiciary and its
			<lb />
			independence. In interpreting the constitutional provisions in this area the
			<lb />
			Court should adopt a construction which strengthens the foundational
			<lb />
			features and the basic structure of the Constitution. Rule of law is a basic
			<lb />
			feature of the Constitution which permeates the whole of the constitutional
			<lb />
			fabric and is an integral part of the constitutional structure. Independence
			<lb />
			of the judiciary is an essential attribute of rule of law.&quot; 490
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			298. Similarly, in Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab 491 it was said by Justice
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			K. Ramaswamy (dissent) that an independent judiciary is the most essential
			<lb />
			attribute of the Rule of Law:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Independent judiciary is the most essential attribute of rule of law and is
			<lb />
			indispensible to sustain democracy. Independence and integrity of the
			<lb />
			judiciary in a democratic system of Government is of the highest
			<lb />
			importance and interest not only to the judges but to the people at large
			<lb />
			who seek judicial redress against perceived legal injury or executive
			<lb />
			excesses.&quot; 492
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			299. This view was reiterated by the learned judge in yet another dissent,
			<lb />
			that is, in Krishna Swami v. Union of India. 493
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			300. In Union of India v. Madras Bar Association 494 speaking for the
			<lb />
			Court, Justice Raveendran held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The rule of law has several facets, one of which is that disputes of citizens
			<lb />
			will be decided by Judges who are independent and impartial; and that
			<lb />
			disputes as to legality of acts of the Government will be decided by Judges
			<lb />
			who are independent of the executive.&quot; 495
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			301. Finally, in State of Tamil Nadu it was unanimously held by the Bench
			<lb />
			speaking through Chief Justice Lodha that the independence of the judiciary
			<lb />
			is fundamental to the Rule of Law:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Independence of courts from the executive and legislature is fundamental
			<lb />
			to the rule of law and one of the basic tenets of Indian Constitution.
			<lb />
			Separation of judicial power is a significant constitutional principle under
			<lb />
			the Constitution of India.&quot; 496
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			302. The view that the Rule of Law and the independence of the judiciary
			<lb />
			go hand in hand and are a part of the basic structure of the Constitution has
			<lb />
			been acknowledged in several other decisions as well and is no longer in
			<lb />
			dispute, nor was it disputed by any of the learned counsel before us. It is,
			<lb />
			therefore, not necessary to cite a train of cases in this regard, except to
			<lb />
			conclude that the Rule of Law and the independence of the judiciary are
			<lb />
			intertwined and inseparable and a part of the basic structure of our
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Independence of the judiciary -its nature and content
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			303. What are the attributes of an independent judiciary? It is impossible to
			<lb />
			define them, except illustratively. At this stage, it is worth recalling the
			<lb />
			words of Sir Ninian Stephen, a former Judge of the High Court of Australia
			<lb />
			who memorably said: &apos;[An] independent judiciary, although a formidable
			<lb />
			protector of individual liberty, is at the same time a very vulnerable
			<lb />
			institution, a fragile bastion indeed.&apos; 497 It is this fragile bastion that needs
			<lb />
			protection to maintain its independence and if this fragile bastion is subject
			<lb />
			to a challenge, constitutional protection is necessary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			304. The independence of the judiciary takes within its fold two broad
			<lb />
			concepts: (1) Independence of an individual judge, that is, decisional
			<lb />
			independence; and (2) Independence of the judiciary as an institution or an
			<lb />
			organ of the State, that is, functional independence. In a lecture on Judicial
			<lb />
			Independence, Lord Phillips 498 said: &apos;In order to be impartial a judge must be
			<lb />
			independent; personally independent, that is free of personal pressures and
			<lb />
			institutionally independent, that is free of pressure from the State.&apos;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			305. As far as individual independence is concerned, the Constitution
			<lb />
			provides security of tenure of office till the age of 65 years for a judge of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court. 499 However, the judge may resign earlier or may be removed
			<lb />
			by a process of impeachment on the ground of proved misbehavior or
			<lb />
			incapacity. 500 To give effect to this, Parliament has enacted the Judges
			<lb />
			(Inquiry) Act, 1968. The procedure for the impeachment of a judge is that a
			<lb />
			motion may be passed after an address by each House of Parliament
			<lb />
			supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a
			<lb />
			majority of not less than 2/3 rd members of that House present and voting in
			<lb />
			the same session. To maintain the integrity and independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary, the impeachment process is not a cake walk.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			306. A judge&apos;s salary, privileges, allowances, leave of absence and pension
			<lb />
			and such other privileges, allowances and rights mentioned in the Second
			<lb />
			Schedule of the Constitution are protected and will not be varied to his/her
			<lb />
			disadvantage after appointment. 501 To give effect to this, Parliament has
			<lb />
			enacted the Supreme Court Judges (Conditions of Service) Act, 1958.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			307. The salary, allowances and pension payable to or in respect of a judge
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court is charged to the Consolidated Fund of India. 502 The
			<lb />
			estimate of this expenditure may be discussed but shall not be submitted to
			<lb />
			the vote of Parliament. 503
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			308. As far as this subject is concerned in respect of a judge of the High
			<lb />
			Court, there is an extensive reference in Sankalchand Sheth. Broadly, the
			<lb />
			constitutional protections and provisions for a judge of the High Court are
			<lb />
			the same as for a judge of the Supreme Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			309. A judge of the High Court has security of tenure till the age of 62
			<lb />
			years 504 and the removal process is the same as for a judge of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court. 505 The salary, privileges, allowances, right of leave of absence and
			<lb />
			pension etc. are protected by Article 221 of the Constitution. While the
			<lb />
			salary and allowances are charged to the Consolidated Fund of the State, 506
			<lb />
			the pension payable is charged to the Consolidated Fund of India. 507 As in the
			<lb />
			case of the Supreme Court, the estimate of this expenditure may be discussed
			<lb />
			but shall not be submitted to the vote of the Legislative Assembly. 508 The
			<lb />
			conditions of service of a High Court judge are governed by the High Court
			<lb />
			Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954 in terms of Article 221
			<lb />
			of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			310. The entire package of rights and protections ensures that a judge
			<lb />
			remains independent and is free to take a decision in accordance with law
			<lb />
			unmindful of the consequences to his/her continuance as a judge. This does
			<lb />
			not mean that a judge may take whatever decision he/she desires to take. The
			<lb />
			parameters of decision making and discretion are circumscribed by the
			<lb />
			Constitution, the statute and the Rule of Law. This is the essence of
			<lb />
			decisional independence, not that judges can do as they please.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			311. In this context, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy of the US Supreme Court
			<lb />
			had this to say before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary
			<lb />
			(Judicial Security and Independence) on 14 th February, 2007:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Judicial independence is not conferred so judges can do as they please.
			<lb />
			Judicial independence is conferred so judges can do as they must. A
			<lb />
			judiciary with permanent tenure, with a sufficient degree of separation
			<lb />
			from other branches of government, and with the undoubted obligation to
			<lb />
			resist improper influence is essential to the Rule of Law as we have come
			<lb />
			to understand that term.&quot; 509
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			312. As far as decisional independence is concerned, a good example of the
			<lb />
			protection is to be found in Anderson v. Gorrie 510 where it was said by Lord
			<lb />
			Esher M.R.:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;the question arises whether there can be an action against a judge of a
			<lb />
			court of record for doing something within his jurisdiction, but doing it
			<lb />
			maliciously and contrary to good faith. By the common law of England it
			<lb />
			is the law that no such action will lie.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Explaining this, Lord Bridge of Harwich said in McC (A Minor), Re 511 :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The principle underlying this rule is clear. If one judge in a thousand acts
			<lb />
			dishonestly within his jurisdiction to the detriment of a party before him, it
			<lb />
			is less harmful to the health of society to leave that party without a remedy
			<lb />
			than that nine hundred and ninety nine honest judges should be harassed
			<lb />
			by vexatious litigation alleging malice in the exercise of their proper
			<lb />
			jurisdiction.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			313. As far as institutional independence is concerned, our Constitution
			<lb />
			provides for it as well. For the Supreme Court, institutional independence is
			<lb />
			provided for in Article 129 which enables the institution to punish for
			<lb />
			contempt of itself. A similar provision is made for the High Court in Article
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			215. The law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts
			<lb />
			within the territory of India. 512 All authorities, civil and judicial are obliged
			<lb />
			to act in aid of the Supreme Court. 513 The Supreme Court is entitled to pass
			<lb />
			such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in
			<lb />
			any cause or matter pending before it and such decree or order shall also be
			<lb />
			enforceable throughout the territory of India. 514 Subject to a law made by
			<lb />
			Parliament, the Supreme Court is entitled to frame rules to regulate its
			<lb />
			practice and procedure. 515 The Chief Justice of India is empowered to appoint
			<lb />
			officers and &apos;servants&apos; of the Supreme Court but their conditions of service
			<lb />
			shall be regulated by rules made by the Supreme Court (subject to approval
			<lb />
			by the President) or by law made by Parliament. 516 The administrative
			<lb />
			expenses of the Supreme Court, including expenses related to its officers and
			<lb />
			&apos;servants&apos; shall be charged upon the Consolidated Fund of India. 517
			<lb />
			314. Significantly, no discussion shall take place in Parliament with respect
			<lb />
			to the conduct of a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court, except in
			<lb />
			proceedings for impeachment. 518 Similarly, the Legislature of a State shall
			<lb />
			not discuss the conduct of a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court in
			<lb />
			the discharge of his or her duties. 519
			<lb />
			512 Article 141. There is no corresponding constitutional provision for the High Court.
			<lb />
			513 Article 144. There is no corresponding constitutional provision for the High Court.
			<lb />
			514 Article 142. There is no corresponding constitutional provision for the High Court.
			<lb />
			515 Article 145. There is no corresponding constitutional provision for the High Court.
			<lb />
			516 Article 146. The corresponding constitutional provision for the High Court is Article 229.
			<lb />
			517 Article 146. The corresponding constitutional provision for the High Court is Article 229.
			<lb />
			518 Article 121
			<lb />
			519 Article 211
			<lb />
			Page 753
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			315. In addition to the above, there are other general protections available
			<lb />
			to an individual judge or to the institution as such. Through Article 50 520
			<lb />
			which is a provision in Part IV of the Constitution (Granville Austin in &apos;The
			<lb />
			Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation&apos; describes Part III and Part IV of the
			<lb />
			Constitution as &apos;the conscience of the Constitution&apos;) 521 the judiciary shall be
			<lb />
			insulated from executive interference. Justice Krishna Iyer speaking for
			<lb />
			himself and Justice Fazl Ali pointed out in Sankalchand Sheth that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Under the general law of civil liability (Tort) words spoken or written in
			<lb />
			the discharge of his judicial duties by a Judge of the High Court are
			<lb />
			absolutely privileged and no action for defamation can lie in respect of
			<lb />
			such words. This absolute immunity is conferred on the Judges on the
			<lb />
			ground of public policy, namely, that they can thereby discharge their duty
			<lb />
			fearlessly.&quot; 522
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			316. Similarly, Section 3 of the Judges (Protection) Act, 1985 provides,
			<lb />
			inter alia, that no court shall entertain or continue any civil or criminal
			<lb />
			proceeding against any person who is or was a judge for any act, thing or
			<lb />
			word committed, done or spoken by him when, or in the course of, acting or
			<lb />
			purporting to act in the discharge of his official or judicial duty or function.
			<lb />
			This is in addition to the protection given by Section 77 of the Indian Penal
			<lb />
			Code which provides that: &apos;Nothing is an offence which is done by a Judge
			<lb />
			when acting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which in
			<lb />
			good faith he believes to be, given to him by law.&apos;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			317. In the overall conspectus and structure of the independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary, it was stated in the First Judges case by Justice D.A. Desai that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			520 Article 50: The State shall take steps to separate the judiciary from the executive in the public services of
			<lb />
			the State.
			<lb />
			521 Page 50
			<lb />
			522 Paragraph 77
			<lb />
			Page 754
			<lb />
			&apos;Independence of judiciary under the Constitution has to be interpreted
			<lb />
			within the framework and the parameters of the Constitution.&apos; 523 It may be
			<lb />
			added that the framework and parameters of the law are also required to be
			<lb />
			taken into consideration. Justice Bhagwati put it quite succinctly when he
			<lb />
			said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The concept of independence of the judiciary is not limited only to
			<lb />
			independence from executive pressure or influence but it is a much wider
			<lb />
			concept which takes within its sweep independence from many other
			<lb />
			pressures and prejudices. It has many dimensions, namely, fearlessness of
			<lb />
			other power centres, economic or political, and freedom from prejudices
			<lb />
			acquired and nourished by the class to which the Judges belong.&quot; 524
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			318. Generally speaking, therefore, the independence of the judiciary is
			<lb />
			manifested in the ability of a judge to take a decision independent of any
			<lb />
			external (or internal) pressure or fear of any external (or internal) pressure
			<lb />
			and that is &apos;decisional independence&apos;. It is also manifested in the ability of
			<lb />
			the institution to have &apos;functional independence&apos;. A comprehensive and
			<lb />
			composite definition of &apos;independence of the judiciary&apos; is elusive but it is
			<lb />
			easy to perceive.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			319. The Constituent Assembly fully appreciated the necessity of having an
			<lb />
			independent judiciary and perhaps devoted more time to discussing this than
			<lb />
			any other issue. Granville Austin points out the following:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The subjects that loomed largest in the minds of Assembly members
			<lb />
			when framing the Judicial provisions were the independence of the courts
			<lb />
			and two closely related issues, the powers of the Supreme Court and
			<lb />
			judicial review. The Assembly went to great lengths to ensure that the
			<lb />
			courts would be independent, devoting more hours of debate to this subject
			<lb />
			than to almost any other aspect of the provisions. If the beacon of the
			<lb />
			judiciary was to remain bright, the courts must be above reproach, free
			<lb />
			from coercion and from political influence.&quot; 525
			<lb />
		</item>
		<head>
			Separation between the judiciary and the executive
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			320. Another facet of the discussion relating to the independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary can be resolved by considering Article 50 of the Constitution. 526
			<lb />
			This Article was referred to in the Second Judges case and, according to
			<lb />
			learned counsel for the petitioners, overlooked in the First Judges case. It
			<lb />
			was urged that that Article is of great importance in as much as the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly was quite explicit that there should be a separation
			<lb />
			between the executive and the judiciary. The learned Attorney-General
			<lb />
			submitted, on the other hand, that the separation postulated by Article 50 of
			<lb />
			the Constitution was only limited to the public services of the State and not
			<lb />
			the judiciary as a whole.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			321. Article 50 was incorporated in the Constitution in the chapter on
			<lb />
			Directive Principles of State Policy at the instance of Dr. Ambedkar who
			<lb />
			moved a proposal on 24 th November, 1948 to insert Article 39A in the Draft
			<lb />
			Constitution. 527
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			322. Explaining the necessity of inserting Article 39A in the Draft
			<lb />
			Constitution, Dr. Ambedkar said that it had been the desire for a long time
			<lb />
			that there should be a separation of the judiciary from the executive and a
			<lb />
			demand for this had been continuing ever since the Congress (party) was
			<lb />
			525 Granville Austin -&quot;Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation&quot; pages 164-164
			<lb />
			526 50. Separation of judiciary from executive.-The State shall take steps to separate the judiciary from the
			<lb />
			executive in the public services of the State.
			<lb />
			527 39-A. That State shall take steps to secure that, within a period of three years from the commencement of
			<lb />
			this Constitution, there is separation of the judiciary from the executive in the public services of the State.
			<lb />
			Page 756
			<lb />
			founded. The British Government, however, did not give any effect to this
			<lb />
			demand. Dr. Ambedkar moved for the insertion of Article 39A in the Draft
			<lb />
			Constitution in the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;I do not think it is necessary for me to make any very lengthy statement in
			<lb />
			support of the amendment which I have moved. It has been the desire of
			<lb />
			this country from long past that there should be separation of the judiciary
			<lb />
			from the executive and the demand has been continued right from the time
			<lb />
			when the Congress was founded. Unfortunately, the British Government
			<lb />
			did not give effect to the resolutions of the Congress demanding this
			<lb />
			particular principle being introduced into the administration of the country.
			<lb />
			We think that the time has come when this reform should be carried out. It
			<lb />
			is, of course, realized that there may be certain difficulties in the carrying
			<lb />
			out of this reform; consequently this amendment has taken into
			<lb />
			consideration two particular matters which may be found to be matters of
			<lb />
			difficulty. One is this: that we deliberately did not make it a matter of
			<lb />
			fundamental principle, because if we had made it a matter of fundamental
			<lb />
			principle it would have become absolutely obligatory instantaneously on
			<lb />
			the passing of the Constitution to bring about the separation of the judiciary
			<lb />
			and the executive. We have therefore deliberately put this matter in the
			<lb />
			chapter dealing with directive principles and there too we have provided
			<lb />
			that this reform shall be carried out within three years, so that there is no
			<lb />
			room left for what might be called procrastination in a matter of this kind.
			<lb />
			Sir, I move.&quot; 528
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			323. Mr. B. Das (Orissa: General) opposed the amendment on the ground
			<lb />
			that when the people were harassed by the British Government, the feeling
			<lb />
			was that no justice was given and that is why there was a demand for the
			<lb />
			separation of the judiciary from the executive. After Independence that
			<lb />
			suspicion did not exist and therefore it was essential to examine whether
			<lb />
			separation was necessary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			324. The debate continued the next day on 25 th November, 1948 when, as
			<lb />
			soon as the Constituent Assembly met, Dr. Ambedkar moved an amendment
			<lb />
			for the deletion of certain words from Article 39A of the Draft Constitution.
			<lb />
			As a result of this proposed amendment, Article 39A would read as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The State shall take steps to separate the judiciary from the executive in
			<lb />
			the public services of the State.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			325. During the course of the debate on 25 th November, 1948 a self-evident
			<lb />
			truth came into focus. It was pointed out by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru (United
			<lb />
			Provinces: General) that the Constitution is expected to last a long time and
			<lb />
			that it should not be rigid. As far as the &apos;basic nature&apos; of the Constitution is
			<lb />
			concerned it must deal with fundamental aspects of the political, social,
			<lb />
			economic and other spheres and not with the details which are matters for
			<lb />
			legislation. It was stated in this context as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Coming to this present amendment, if I may again make some general
			<lb />
			observations with all respect to this House, it is this: that I have felt that
			<lb />
			the dignity of a Constitution is not perhaps maintained sufficiently if one
			<lb />
			goes into too great detail in that Constitution. A Constitution is something
			<lb />
			which should last a long time, which is built on a strong foundation, and
			<lb />
			which may of course be varied from time to time -it should not be rigid -
			<lb />
			nevertheless, one should think of it as something which is going to last,
			<lb />
			which is not a transitory Constitution, a provisional Constitution, a
			<lb />
			something which you are going to change from day to day, a something
			<lb />
			which has provisions for the next year or the year after next and so on and
			<lb />
			so forth. It may be necessary to have certain transitory provisions. It will
			<lb />
			be necessary, because there is a change to have some such provisions, but
			<lb />
			so far as the basic nature of the Constitution is concerned, it must deal with
			<lb />
			the fundamental aspects of the political, the social, the economic and other
			<lb />
			spheres, and not with the details which are matters for legislation. You will
			<lb />
			find that if you go into too great detail and mix up the really basic and
			<lb />
			fundamental things with the important but nevertheless secondary things,
			<lb />
			you bring the basic things to the level of the secondary things too. You lose
			<lb />
			them in a forest of detail. The great trees that you should like to plant and
			<lb />
			wait for them to grow and to be seen are hidden in a forest of detail and
			<lb />
			smaller trees. I have felt that we are spending a great deal of time on
			<lb />
			undoubtedly important matters, but nevertheless secondary matters -
			<lb />
			matters which are for legislation, not for a Constitution. However, that is a
			<lb />
			general observation.&quot; 529
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			326. The significance of the view expressed by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru is
			<lb />
			that the existence of the &apos;basic nature&apos; of the Constitution was recognized and
			<lb />
			it appears that this is what we call today as the basic structure or basic
			<lb />
			features of the Constitution. Undoubtedly there was an acknowledgement of
			<lb />
			certain fundamental aspects of the Constitution but it was not possible to go
			<lb />
			into details in respect of each and every one of them. Explaining this in the
			<lb />
			context of the &apos;matters of extreme moment&apos; Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru said that
			<lb />
			India is a very mixed country &apos;politically, judicially, economically and in
			<lb />
			many ways and any fixed rule of thumb to be applied to every area may be
			<lb />
			disadvantageous and difficult in regard to certain areas. On the one hand, that
			<lb />
			rule will really prevent progress in one area, and on the other hand, it may
			<lb />
			upset the apple-cart in some other area. Therefore, a certain flexibility is
			<lb />
			desirable.&apos; 530
			<lb />
			327. The views expressed by Dr. Bakshi Tek Chand (East Punjab: General)
			<lb />
			are extremely important in this regard. The Hon&apos;ble Member gave a detailed
			<lb />
			historical background for the demand of separation of the executive and the
			<lb />
			judiciary and expressed the view that as far back as in 1852 when public
			<lb />
			opinion in Bengal began to express itself in an organized manner that the
			<lb />
			matter of separation was first mooted. In other words, the separation of the
			<lb />
			executive from the judiciary had been in demand for almost 100 years.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			328. Dr. Bakshi Tek Chand was of the view that with Independence, the
			<lb />
			necessity of this reform had become greater. The Hon&apos;ble Member cited
			<lb />
			three illustrative instances of interference with the judiciary by Ministers of
			<lb />
			some Provinces and members of political parties in the fair administration of
			<lb />
			justice. Dr. Bakshi Tek Chand gave these extremely telling examples and it is
			<lb />
			best to quote what was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;One word more I have to say in this connection and that is, that with the
			<lb />
			advent of democracy and freedom, the necessity of this reform has become
			<lb />
			all the greater. Formerly it was only the district magistrate and a few
			<lb />
			members of the bureaucratic Government from whom interference with the
			<lb />
			judiciary was apprehended, but now, I am very sorry to say that even the
			<lb />
			Ministers in some provinces and members of political parties have begun to
			<lb />
			interfere with the administration of justice. Those of you, who may be
			<lb />
			reading news paper reports of judicial decisions lately, must have been
			<lb />
			struck with this type of interference which has been under review in the
			<lb />
			various High Courts lately. In one province we found that in a case pending
			<lb />
			in a Criminal Court, the Ministry sent for the record and passed an order
			<lb />
			directing the trying Magistrate to stay proceedings in the case. This was
			<lb />
			something absolutely unheard of. The matter eventually went up to the
			<lb />
			High Court and the learned Chief Justice and another Judge had to pass
			<lb />
			very strong remarks against such executive interference with the
			<lb />
			administration of justice
			<lb />
			In another province a case was being tried against a member of the
			<lb />
			Legislative Assembly and a directive went from the District Magistrate to
			<lb />
			the Magistrate trying the case not to proceed with it further and to release
			<lb />
			the man. The Magistrate who was a member of the Judicial Service and
			<lb />
			was officiating as a Magistrate had the strength to resist this demand. He
			<lb />
			had all those letters put on the record and eventually the matter went to the
			<lb />
			High Court and the Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court made very
			<lb />
			strong remarks about this matter.
			<lb />
			Again in the Punjab, a case has recently occurred in which a Judge of the
			<lb />
			High Court, Mr. Justice Achru Ram, heard a habeas corpus petition and
			<lb />
			delivered a judgment of 164 pages at the conclusion of which he observed
			<lb />
			that the action taken by the District Magistrate and the Superintendent of
			<lb />
			Police against a member of the Congress Party was mala fide and was the
			<lb />
			result of a personal vendetta. These were his remarks.
			<lb />
			In these circumstances, I submit that with the change of circumstances and
			<lb />
			with the advent of freedom and the introduction of democracy, it has
			<lb />
			become all the more necessary to bring about the separation of the judiciary
			<lb />
			from the executive at the earliest possible opportunity.&quot; 531
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			329. The debate concluded on 25 th November, 1948 with the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly eventually accepting the insertion of Article 39A in the Draft
			<lb />
			Constitution. This is now Article 50 in our Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			330. The importance of the debate must be looked at not only from a
			<lb />
			historical perspective but also what was intended for the future by the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly. In the past there had been unabashed interference by
			<lb />
			the executive in the administration of justice by the subordinate judiciary and
			<lb />
			this definitely needed to be checked. In that sense, the debate on 24 th and 25 th
			<lb />
			November, 1948 was a precursor to the debate on Article 103 of the Draft
			<lb />
			Constitution held on 23 rd and 24 th May, 1949. By that time it was becoming
			<lb />
			clear (if it was not already clear) to the Constituent Assembly that there
			<lb />
			should be no interference by the executive in the administration of justice and
			<lb />
			that it was not necessary to provide for every detail in the Draft Constitution.
			<lb />
			That constitutional conventions existed prior to Independence were known,
			<lb />
			but that they were required to be continued after Independence was of equal
			<lb />
			significance.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			331. With the need for avoiding details in the Constitution, the Draft
			<lb />
			Constitution did not specifically provide for the independence of the judiciary
			<lb />
			other than the subordinate judiciary. If this is looked at quite plainly, it would
			<lb />
			appear anachronistic to hold a view that Article 39A of the Draft Constitution
			<lb />
			required the subordinate judiciary to be independent and separate from the
			<lb />
			executive but it was not necessary for the superior judiciary to be
			<lb />
			independent or separate. Such an obvious anachronism cannot be attributed
			<lb />
			to the Constituent Assembly. One must, therefore, assume that either the
			<lb />
			superior judiciary was already independent (and this needed no iteration) or
			<lb />
			that if it was not independent then, like the subordinate judiciary, it must be
			<lb />
			made independent, with the executive not being permitted to interfere in the
			<lb />
			administration of justice. Either way, separation between the judiciary and the
			<lb />
			executive with the intention of having an independent judiciary was a
			<lb />
			desirable objective.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			332. No one can doubt and, indeed, even the learned Attorney-General did
			<lb />
			not doubt that the independence of the judiciary is absolutely necessary. But,
			<lb />
			the independence of the judiciary is not an end in itself. &apos;Instead, the aim is
			<lb />
			to secure an independent judiciary that will discharge its fundamental
			<lb />
			responsibilities, which include a crucial role in upholding the rule of law.&apos; 532
			<lb />
			In addition, the judiciary should clearly be separate from the executive.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			333. By way of digression, a word may also be said about the financial
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary. In a letter of 15 th June, 2008 forwarding the
			<lb />
			Report of the Task Force on &apos;Judicial Impact Assessment&apos; it was pointed out
			<lb />
			by Justice M. Jagannadha Rao (Retired) to the Minister for Law and Justice
			<lb />
			that &apos;the Planning Commission and Finance Commission must make
			<lb />
			adequate provision in consultation with the Chief Justice of India, for
			<lb />
			realization of the basic human rights of &apos;access to justice&apos; and &apos;speedy
			<lb />
			justice&apos; both civil and criminal. The present allocation of 0.071%, 0.078%
			<lb />
			and 0.07% of the Plan outlay in the 9 th , 10 th and 11 th Plan are wholly
			<lb />
			insufficient.&apos; Financial independence is one area which is also critical to the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary but is among the least discussed.

			Independence of the judiciary and the appointment process
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			334. We must proceed on the basis that the independence of the judiciary is
			<lb />
			vital to democracy and there ought to be a separation between the executive
			<lb />
			and the judiciary. The independence of the judiciary begins with the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge. Granville Austin says: &apos;An independent judiciary
			<lb />
			begins with who appoints what calibre of judges.&apos; 533 It must be appreciated
			<lb />
			and acknowledged that methodological independence, namely, the
			<lb />
			recommendation and appointment of judges to a superior Court is an
			<lb />
			important facet of the independence of the judiciary. 534 If a person of
			<lb />
			doubtful ability or integrity is appointed as a judge, there is a probability of
			<lb />
			his/her succumbing to internal or external pressure and delivering a tainted
			<lb />
			verdict. This will strike at the root of the independence of the judiciary and
			<lb />
			destroy the faith of the common person in fair justice delivery. Therefore,
			<lb />
			there is a great obligation and responsibility on all constitutional
			<lb />
			functionaries, including the Chief Justice of India and the President, to
			<lb />
			ensure that not only are deserving persons appointed as judges, but that
			<lb />
			deserving persons are not denied appointment. 535
			<lb />

			<lb />
			respect of the commissioning of all officers of the United States, the clauses
			<lb />
			in the Constitution and the laws of the United States &apos;seem to contemplate
			<lb />
			three distinct operations&apos;, namely:

			<lb />
			&quot;1. The nomination. This is the sole act of the president, and is completely
			<lb />
			voluntary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			2. The appointment. This is also the act of the president, and is also a
			<lb />
			voluntary act, though it can only be performed by and with the advice and
			<lb />
			consent of the senate.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3. The commission. To grant a commission to a person appointed, might
			<lb />
			perhaps be deemed a duty enjoined by the constitution. &quot;He shall,&quot; says
			<lb />
			that instrument, &quot;commission all the officers of the United States.&quot; 536
			<lb />
			336. Transposing this to the appointment of judges in our country, the first
			<lb />
			step is a recommendation (or nomination) of persons for appointment as
			<lb />
			judges. Historically, the recommendation is made by the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India for the appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court and by the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of a High Court for appointment of a judge to the High Court.
			<lb />
			Occasionally, the Chief Minister of a State also makes a recommendation,
			<lb />
			but that is required to be routed through the Chief Justice of the High Court.
			<lb />
			There is no instance of the President recommending any person for
			<lb />
			appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			337. The second step is the appointment of a judge and this is possible only
			<lb />
			through a consultative participatory process between the President and the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India. It is in this process that there has been some
			<lb />
			interpretational disagreement, but the Second Judges case and the Third
			<lb />
			Judges case have laid that to rest with a shared primacy and responsibility
			<lb />
			between the President and the Chief Justice of India. This has already been
			<lb />
			discussed above.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			338. The third step is the issuance of a warrant of appointment (or
			<lb />
			commission). It is quite clear that the warrant of appointment can be issued
			<lb />
			only by the President. There is not and cannot be any dispute about this.
			<lb />
			Under the circumstances it is clear that the executive function of the
			<lb />
			President remains intact, unlike what the learned Attorney-General says and
			<lb />
			there is no scope for the recitation of the &apos;judges appointing judges&apos;mantra.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			339. It is perhaps this simple three-step process that the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly intended. But this got distorted over the years, thanks to the
			<lb />
			interference by the political executive in the first and second steps.

			<lb />
			Appointments to the European Court of Human Rights&apos; 537 the interplay
			<lb />
			between the Rule of Law, the independence of the judiciary and the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges is commented upon and in a reference to international
			<lb />
			standards, it is said that the appointment of judges plays a key role in
			<lb />
			safeguarding the independence of the judiciary. This is what was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The independence of the judiciary is one of the cornerstones of the rule of
			<lb />
			law. Rather than being elected by the people, judges derive their authority
			<lb />
			and legitimacy from their independence from political or other
			<lb />
			interference. It is clear from the existing international standards that the
			<lb />
			selection and appointment of judges plays a key role in the safeguarding of
			<lb />
			judicial independence and ensuring the most competent individuals are
			<lb />
			selected.&quot;

			<lb />
			&quot;An independent, impartial, honest and competent judiciary is integral to
			<lb />
			upholding the rule of law, engendering public confidence and dispensing
			<lb />
			justice. The function of the judiciary is to interpret and apply national
			<lb />
			constitutions and legislation, consistent with international human rights
			<lb />
			conventions and international law, to the extent permitted by the domestic
			<lb />
			law of each Commonwealth country. To secure these aims: (a) Judicial
			<lb />
			appointments should be made on the basis of clearly defined criteria and
			<lb />
			by a publicly declared process. The process should ensure: equality of
			<lb />
			opportunity for all who are eligible for judicial office; appointment on
			<lb />
			merit; and that appropriate consideration is given to the need for the
			<lb />
			progressive attainment of gender equity and the removal of other historic
			<lb />
			factors of discrimination;&quot; 539

			<lb />
			to 2010. He delivered the 64 th series of Hamlyn Lectures in 2012 titled
			<lb />
			&apos;Aspects of Law Reform -An Insider&apos;s Perspective&apos;. The 3 rd lecture in that
			<lb />
			series was delivered by him on 4 th December, 2012 on &apos;Judicial
			<lb />
			Appointments&apos;. In that lecture, he says:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The appointment of judges -by whom, according to what standards and
			<lb />
			process, and with what outcome -is of critical importance. To maintain a
			<lb />
			judiciary that is independent, which makes good decisions, and in whom
			<lb />
			the public can continue to have confidence, we need to appoint the most
			<lb />
			meritorious candidates and secure a judiciary that is as reflective as
			<lb />
			possible of the society it is serving.
			<lb />
			And we need to get it right first time, every time, because, once appointed
			<lb />
			to a full-time salaried position, judges may not be removed from office
			<lb />
			other than in the most extreme of circumstances.&quot; 540
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			343. Therefore, in the appointment of a judge, it is not only (negatively
			<lb />
			expressed) that a &apos;wrong person&apos; should not be appointed but (positively
			<lb />
			expressed) the best talent, amongst lawyers and judicial officers should be
			<lb />
			appointed as judges of the High Court and the best amongst the judges of the
			<lb />
			High Courts or amongst advocates or distinguished jurists should be
			<lb />
			appointed to the Supreme Court. It has been stated in the 14 th Report of the
			<lb />
			LCI that the selection of judges is of pivotal importance to the progress of
			<lb />
			the nation and that responsibility must be exercised with great care.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			344. In the Report on Judicial Independence: Law and Practice of
			<lb />
			Appointments to the European Court of Human Rights, great emphasis was
			<lb />
			laid on the procedure for the appointment of judges and the criteria for
			<lb />
			appointment. It was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The issue of how judges are appointed is important in two respects. First,
			<lb />
			appointment procedures impact directly upon the independence and
			<lb />
			impartiality of the judiciary. Since the legitimacy and credibility of any
			<lb />
			judicial institution depends upon public confidence in its independence, it
			<lb />
			is imperative that appointment procedures for judicial office conform to-
			<lb />
			and are seen to conform to-international standards on judicial
			<lb />
			independence. It would be anomalous and unacceptable if the Court
			<lb />
			[European Court of Human Rights] failed to meet the international human
			<lb />
			rights standards that it is charged with implementing, including the
			<lb />
			requirement that cases are heard by an independent and impartial court of
			<lb />
			law.
			<lb />
			Second, without the effective implementation of &apos;objective and transparent
			<lb />
			criteria based on proper professional qualification,&apos; there is the very real
			<lb />
			possibility that the judges selected will not have the requisite skills and
			<lb />
			abilities to discharge their mandate. Declining standards will ultimately
			<lb />
			impact negatively on the standing of the Court [European Court of Human
			<lb />
			Rights], as well as on the application and development of human rights law
			<lb />
			on the international and (ultimately) national level.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			345. In the First Judges case, the question of appointment of judges as
			<lb />
			being integral to the independence of the judiciary was not an issue but
			<lb />
			Justice Venkataramiah expressed the view that it is difficult to hold that if the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges is left to the executive, it will impair the independence
			<lb />
			of the judiciary. The learned judge was of the view that it is only &apos;after such
			<lb />
			appointment the executive should have no scope to interfere with the work of
			<lb />
			a judge.&apos; 541 This view is, with respect, far too narrow and constricted.
			<lb />
			However, Justice D.A. Desai held a different view which was expressed in
			<lb />
			the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Now, the independence of the judiciary can be fully safeguarded not by
			<lb />
			merely conferring security on the Judges during their term of office but by
			<lb />
			ensuring in addition that persons who are independent, upright and of the
			<lb />
			highest character are appointed as Judges. Moreover, there is always the
			<lb />
			fear that appointments left to the absolute discretion of the appointing
			<lb />
			executive could be influenced by party considerations.&quot; 542
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			346. In the Second Judges case Justice Pandian was quite explicit and
			<lb />
			expressed the view that the selection and appointment of a proper and fit
			<lb />
			candidate to the superior judiciary is inseparable from the independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary and a vital condition in securing it. 543 Similarly, Justice Kuldip
			<lb />
			Singh also held that there cannot be an independent judiciary when the
			<lb />
			power of appointment of judges rests with the executive and that the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary is &apos;inextricably linked and connected with the
			<lb />
			constitutional process of appointment of judges of the higher judiciary.&apos; 544
			<lb />
			Justice Verma, speaking for the majority, expressed the view that all
			<lb />
			constitutional authorities involved in the process of appointing judges of the
			<lb />
			superior courts &apos;should be fully alive to the serious implications of their
			<lb />
			constitutional obligation and be zealous in its discharge in order to ensure
			<lb />
			that no doubtful appointment can be made.&apos; 545 The learned judge further said
			<lb />
			that the independence of the judiciary can be safeguarded by preventing the
			<lb />
			influence of political consideration in making appointment of judges to the
			<lb />
			superior judiciary. 546
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			347. There is, therefore, no doubt that the appointment of a judge to the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court or the High Court is an integral part of the independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary. It is not possible to agree with the learned Attorney-General
			<lb />
			when he says that though the appointment of a judge is a part of the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary, it is but a small part and certainly not a
			<lb />
			predominant part. I would say that it is really the foundational part of the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			348. Shimon Shetreet has this to say on the appointment of judges:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;In any system, the methods of appointment have direct bearing on both
			<lb />
			the integrity and independence of the judges. Weak appointments lower the
			<lb />
			status of the judiciary in the eyes of the public and create a climate in
			<lb />
			which the necessary independence of the judiciary is likely to be
			<lb />
			undermined. Similarly, political appointments that are seen by the public
			<lb />
			as not based on merit may arouse concern about the judge&apos;s independence
			<lb />
			and impartiality on the bench. The quality of judicial appointments
			<lb />
			depends upon the process and standards applied by the appointing
			<lb />
			authorities, yet every appointment system has its limitation. It is difficult to
			<lb />
			predict what sort of judge a man or woman will be and irreversible
			<lb />
			mistakes in judicial appointments are bound to occur, even when the
			<lb />
			method of appointment is fair and efficient and the standards are high, as
			<lb />
			they are in England. Such errors in selection apply equally to appointing
			<lb />
			persons who were unfit for occupying a judicial office as well as failing to
			<lb />
			appoint a person who might have been a good judge.&quot; 547
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			349. How do international conventions look at this issue? The Beijing
			<lb />
			Statement of Principles of the Independence of the Judiciary in the
			<lb />
			LAWASIA Region 548 provides, inter alia, as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Independence of the Judiciary requires that; a) The judiciary shall decide
			<lb />
			matters before it in accordance with its impartial assessment of the facts
			<lb />
			and its understanding of the law without improper influences, direct or
			<lb />
			indirect, from any source; and b) The judiciary has jurisdiction, directly or
			<lb />
			by way of review, over all issues of a justiciable nature. 549
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			To enable the judiciary to achieve its objectives and perform its functions,
			<lb />
			it is essential that judges be chosen on the basis of proven competence,
			<lb />
			integrity and independence. 550
			<lb />
			The mode of appointment of judges must be such as will ensure the
			<lb />
			appointment of persons who are best qualified for judicial office. It must
			<lb />
			provide safeguards against improper influences being taken into account so
			<lb />
			that only persons of competence, integrity and independence are
			<lb />
			appointed.&quot; 551
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			This document was signed by Justice S.C. Agrawal of this Court representing
			<lb />
			Chief Justice A. M. Ahmadi.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			350. The Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct, 2002 which lay down
			<lb />
			six essential values for a judge (and which are accepted world-wide both in
			<lb />
			civil law and common law countries) would be totally unworkable if a
			<lb />
			person appointed as a judge, at the time of appointment, lacks basic
			<lb />
			competence and independence. 552 Given all these considerations, it must be
			<lb />
			held and is held that the process for appointment and the actual appointment
			<lb />
			of a judge to a High Court or the Supreme Court is a predominant part of the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary and, therefore, an integral part of the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			351. Therefore, the procedure for the appointment of judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court or the High Courts can impact on the independence of the judiciary
			<lb />
			and the basic structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			The recommendation process
			<lb />
			352. How can the President ensure that the most deserving persons are
			<lb />
			appointed as judges or that they are not denied appointment? This is the nub
			<lb />
			of the controversy before us and this is the problem that has vexed the
			<lb />
			executive, the judiciary, academia, the legal fraternity and civil society over
			<lb />
			several decades. Since justice delivery is undoubtedly the responsibility of
			<lb />
			the judiciary, therefore, the judiciary (symbolized as it were by the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India) is obliged to ensure that only the most deserving persons are
			<lb />
			considered for appointment as judges. 553
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			353. The process of consideration of a person for appointment as a judge is
			<lb />
			important both at a stage prior to the recommendation being made by the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India in consultation with his/her colleagues, constituting a
			<lb />
			&apos;collegium&apos; and also after the recommendation is sent by the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India to the executive. At both stages, the process is participatory. In the
			<lb />
			pre-recommendation stage, it is a participatory process involving the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India and his/her colleagues, constituting the collegium. 554 It is at
			<lb />
			this stage that the Chief Justice of India takes the opinion of the other judges
			<lb />
			and anybody else, if deemed necessary. This stage also includes the
			<lb />
			participation of the executive because it is at this stage that the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India receives inputs from the executive about the frailties, if any, of a
			<lb />
			person who may eventually be appointed a judge. In the
			<lb />
			553 It is not necessary, for the purposes of this discussion, to get into the controversy whether the
			<lb />
			recommendation of a person to be considered for appointment should originate from the executive or the
			<lb />
			judiciary.
			<lb />
			554 Second Judges case, paragraph 293 and 428
			<lb />
			Page 771
			<lb />
			post-recommendation stage also the process is participatory but primarily
			<lb />
			with the executive in the event the executive has some objection to the
			<lb />
			appointment of a particular person for strong and cogent reasons to be
			<lb />
			recorded in writing. 555 Therefore, when a person is considered for
			<lb />
			appointment as a judge, there is extensive and intensive participatory
			<lb />
			consultation within the judiciary before the Chief Justice of India actually
			<lb />
			recommends a person for appointment as a judge; and after the
			<lb />
			recommendation is made, there is consultation between the executive and the
			<lb />
			judiciary before the process is carried further. What can be a more
			<lb />
			meaningful consultation postulated by Article 124(2) of the Constitution?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			354. If a person is not recommended for appointment by the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India or the Chief Justice of a High Court, the chapter of his/her
			<lb />
			appointment closes at that stage. And, if there is no difference of opinion
			<lb />
			between the constitutional functionaries about the suitability of a person for
			<lb />
			appointment then, of course, there are no hurdles to the issuance of a warrant
			<lb />
			of appointment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			355. The difficulty in considering and accepting a recommendation arises
			<lb />
			only if there is a difference of opinion during consultations between the
			<lb />
			executive and the judiciary. The Second Judges case effectively resolves this
			<lb />
			controversy.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			356. At the pre-recommendation stage, it is quite possible that the executive
			<lb />
			is in possession of material regarding some personal trait or weakness of
			<lb />
			character of a lawyer or a judge that is not known to the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India or the Chief Justice of the High Court and which may potentially
			<lb />
			disentitle that person from being appointed a judge. It is then for the
			<lb />
			executive, as a consultant, to bring this information or material to the notice
			<lb />
			of the Chief Justice of India. 556 Since the judiciary has the responsibility of
			<lb />
			recommending an appropriate candidate for appointment as a judge, primacy
			<lb />
			is accorded to the view of the judiciary (symbolized by the view of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India) that will weigh and objectively consider the material or
			<lb />
			information and take a final decision on the desirability of the
			<lb />
			appointment. 557 The Chief Justice of India may, for good reason, accept the
			<lb />
			view of the executive or may, also for good reason, not accept the view of the
			<lb />
			executive. It is in this sense that &apos;consultation&apos; occurring in Article 124(2)
			<lb />
			and Article 217(1) of the Constitution has to be understood. Primacy to the
			<lb />
			judiciary is accorded only to this limited extent, but subject to a proviso
			<lb />
			which will be discussed a little later.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			357. Why is it that limited primacy has been accorded to the judiciary? That
			<lb />
			the judiciary is the best suited to take a decision whether a person should be
			<lb />
			appointed a judge or not is implicit in Article 124(2) and Article 217(1) of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. In Article 124(2) of the Constitution, the President is mandated
			<lb />
			to consult the Chief Justice of India and &apos;such of the Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court and of the High Courts in the States as the President may deem
			<lb />
			necessary.&apos; That the President may choose to consult eminent persons from
			<lb />
			the legal fraternity or civil society is another matter, but the President is not
			<lb />
			required to do so. One of the possible reasons for this could be that the
			<lb />
			Constitution framers were of the opinion that ultimately what is important is
			<lb />
			the opinion of judges and not necessarily of others. Similarly, for the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge of the High Court under Article 217(1) of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, the President is required to consult the Chief Justice of India,
			<lb />
			the Governor of the State and the Chief Justice of the High Court -again not
			<lb />
			anybody else from the legal fraternity or civil society.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			358. Similarly, limited primacy is accorded to the political executive. In the
			<lb />
			event the judiciary does not make a unanimous recommendation for the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Courts, the
			<lb />
			President is entitled to turn down the recommendation. But if the
			<lb />
			recommendation is unanimous but returned for reconsideration by the
			<lb />
			President and thereafter unanimously reiterated by the judiciary, then the
			<lb />
			Council of Ministers is bound by the decision of the judiciary and must
			<lb />
			advise the President accordingly.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			359. Since the Constitution is a flexible document, neither the President nor
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India is precluded from taking the advice of any person,
			<lb />
			lay or professional. In fact, Justice Verma stated in an interview in this regard
			<lb />
			as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Can you throw light on how, during your tenure as the CJI, appointments
			<lb />
			took place?
			<lb />
			For every Supreme Court appointment, I consulted senior lawyers like Fali
			<lb />
			S. Nariman and Shanthi Bhushan. I used to consult five or six top lawyers.
			<lb />
			I used to consult even lawyers belonging to the middle level. Similar
			<lb />
			consultation took place in the case of High Courts. I recorded details of
			<lb />
			every consultation. I wish all my correspondence is made public. After the
			<lb />
			appointment, why should it be secret? If there is a good reason to appoint
			<lb />
			the Judges, then at least the doubts people cast on them even now will not
			<lb />
			be there. And if there is a good reason why they should not have been
			<lb />
			appointed, then it would expose the persons who were responsible for their
			<lb />
			appointment.&quot; 558
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			360. It is this pragmatic interpretation of the Constitution that was
			<lb />
			postulated by the Constituent Assembly, which did not feel the necessity of
			<lb />
			filling up every detail in the document, as indeed it was not possible to do so.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			361. Leaving aside the discussion on the textual interpretation of the
			<lb />
			constitutional provisions and the Constituent Assembly debates, a
			<lb />
			constitutional convention has evolved over the last more than seven decades
			<lb />
			of accepting the opinion of the Chief Justice in the appointment of a person
			<lb />
			as a judge of a superior Court. This constitutional convention has existed, if
			<lb />
			not from the days of the Government of India Act, 1919 then certainly from
			<lb />
			the days of the Government of India Act, 1935. This constitutional
			<lb />
			convention has been exhaustively dealt with by Justice Kuldip Singh in the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case and it was concluded that a constitutional convention is
			<lb />
			as binding as constitutional law. 559 In any event, there is no cogent reason to
			<lb />
			discard a constitutional convention if it is working well. At this stage, it is
			<lb />
			useful to recall the comment of Chief Justice Beg in State of Rajasthan v.
			<lb />
			Union of India 560 that: &apos;… constitutional practice and convention become so
			<lb />
			interlinked with or attached to constitutional provisions and are often so
			<lb />
			important and vital for grasping the real purpose and function of
			<lb />
			constitutional provisions that the two cannot often be viewed apart.&apos; This is
			<lb />
			precisely what has happened in the present case where constitutional
			<lb />
			conventions and practices are so interlinked to the constitutional provisions
			<lb />
			that they are difficult to disassemble.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			362. It is this constitutional interpretation and constitutional convention that
			<lb />
			results in binding the recommendation of the Chief Justice of India on the
			<lb />
			executive that is objected to by the learned Attorney-General as being
			<lb />
			contrary to the Constitution as framed and it is this that is sought to be
			<lb />
			&apos;corrected&apos; by the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			363. The issue may be looked at from yet another angle. Assuming, the
			<lb />
			executive rejects the recommendation of the Chief Justice of India even after
			<lb />
			its unanimous reiteration, what is the solution to the impasse that is created?
			<lb />
			The answer is to be found in Samsher Singh and reiterated in Sankalchand
			<lb />
			Sheth. It was held in Samsher Singh that in such an event, the decision of
			<lb />
			the executive is open to judicial scrutiny. It was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;In all conceivable cases consultation with that highest dignitary of Indian
			<lb />
			justice will and should be accepted by the Government of India and the
			<lb />
			Court will have an opportunity to examine if any other extraneous
			<lb />
			circumstances have entered into the verdict of the Minister, if he departs
			<lb />
			from the counsel given by the Chief Justice of India.&quot; 561
			<lb />
			This view was reiterated in Sankalchand Sheth. 562 Of course, it is another
			<lb />
			matter that no one has a right to be appointed as a judge, but certainly if the
			<lb />
			unanimous recommendation of the judiciary through the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India is not accepted by the President, if nothing else, at least the record will
			<lb />
			be put straight and the possible damage to the dignity, reputation and honour
			<lb />
			of the person who was recommended by the Chief Justice of India will be
			<lb />
			restored, at least to some extent. 364. But is judicial review necessarily the
			<lb />
			only answer to a problem of this nature? Should the executive and the
			<lb />
			judiciary ever be on a collision course in the appointment of a judge? Not
			<lb />
			only did Dr. Ambedkar think that such a situation would not occur, he never
			<lb />
			visualized it. Dr. Ambedkar made provision for virtually every contingency,
			<lb />
			except a stalemate or deadlock situation -he never imagined that such an
			<lb />
			eventuality would ever arise.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			365. That there would be no difference or little difference or a manageable
			<lb />
			difference of opinion between the President and the Chief Justice of India or
			<lb />
			that the judiciary should have a final say in the matter so as not to make the
			<lb />
			consultation process a mere formality, is quite apparent from the fact that the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly deliberately drew a distinction between the
			<lb />
			appointment by the President of a judge of the Supreme Court and a judge of
			<lb />
			the High Court (on the one hand) and the appointment by the President of
			<lb />
			other constitutional authorities. For the appointment of a judge, it is
			<lb />
			mandated in the Constitution that the President must consult the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India. However, to appoint the Comptroller and Auditor General
			<lb />
			under Article 148 of the Constitution (for example), the President is under no
			<lb />
			such obligation to consult anybody even though the position is one of vital
			<lb />
			importance. Dr. Ambedkar had said in this regard:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;I cannot say I am very happy about the position which the Draft
			<lb />
			Constitution, including the amendments which have been moved to the
			<lb />
			articles relating to the Auditor-General in this House, assigns to him.
			<lb />
			Personally speaking for myself, I am of opinion that this dignitary or
			<lb />
			officer is probably the most important officer in the Constitution of India.
			<lb />
			He is the one man who is going to see that the expenses voted by
			<lb />
			Parliament are not exceeded, or varied from what has been laid down by
			<lb />
			Parliament in what is called the Appropriation Act. If this functionary is to
			<lb />
			carry out the duties -and his duties, I submit, are far more important than
			<lb />
			the duties even of the judiciary -he should have been certainly as
			<lb />
			independent as the Judiciary. But, comparing the articles about the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court and the articles relating to the Auditor-General, I cannot
			<lb />
			help saying that we have not given him the same independence which we
			<lb />
			have given to the Judiciary, although I personally feel that he ought to have
			<lb />
			far greater independence than the Judiciary itself.&quot;
		</item>
		<p>
			563
			<lb />
			Similarly, the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and the
			<lb />
			Election Commissioners under Article 324 of the Constitution does not
			<lb />
			require the President to consult anybody, even though free and fair elections
			<lb />
			are undoubtedly vital to our democracy. Since the consultation provision was
			<lb />
			incorporated only for the appointment of judges, surely, the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly had good reasons for making this distinction. Justice Khehar has
			<lb />
			referred to other Presidential appointments in his draft judgment and it is not
			<lb />
			necessary to repeat them. What is
			<lb />
			important is the &apos;message&apos; sought to be conveyed by the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly and the sanctity given to a recommendation by the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India for the appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			366. It is trite that the Constitution is a living document. 564 Keeping this in
			<lb />
			mind, could it be said that a strained interpretation has been given to Article
			<lb />
			124(2) and Article 217(1) of the Constitution particularly when the
			<lb />
			substitution of &apos;consultation&apos; with &apos;concurrence&apos; in the draft of Article 124
			<lb />
			was discussed in the Constituent Assembly and not accepted? 565 Definitely
			<lb />
			not, particularly if one looks at the context in which &apos;consultation&apos; is used
			<lb />
			and the purpose for which it is used, namely, to fetter the discretion of the
			<lb />
			President by someone who knows what is in the best interests of the
			<lb />
			judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			367. But, as mentioned earlier, it is not necessary to dwell at length upon
			<lb />
			the correctness or otherwise of the procedure for the appointment of a judge
			<lb />
			as laid down in the Second Judges case and the Third Judges case. The
			<lb />
			question really is whether the change in the procedure of appointment of
			<lb />
			judges violates the basic structure of the Constitution. Can the Judiciary be
			<lb />
			independent if the appointment process is in the hands of the National
			<lb />
			Judicial Appointments Commission?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Amendment of the Constitution through Article 368
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			368. Proceeding on the basis, as we should, that the independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution, and that the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge to the Supreme Court or a High Court is an
			<lb />
			integral and foundational part of the independence of the judiciary, the
			<lb />
			question that arises is to what extent, if at all, can the appointment
			<lb />
			process be tinkered with by Parliament.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			369. Article 368 of the Constitution provides for the &apos;Power of Parliament
			<lb />
			to amend the Constitution and procedure therefor&apos;. While the power is vast,
			<lb />
			empowering Parliament to add, vary or repeal any provision of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, the breadth of that power has inherent limitations as explained
			<lb />
			in Kesavananda Bharati which is that the basic structure of the Constitution
			<lb />
			cannot be altered. What constitutes the basic structure of the Constitution has
			<lb />
			been considered in several decisions of this Court and democracy (for
			<lb />
			example) or free and fair elections or judicial review of legislative action or
			<lb />
			separation (or distribution) of powers between the Legislature, the Executive
			<lb />
			and the Judiciary have all been held to be a part of the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. There is no doubt, and no one has disputed it, that the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary is also a part of the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			370. The constitutional requirement for amending the Constitution is: (a)
			<lb />
			The amendment may be initiated only by the introduction of a Bill for the
			<lb />
			purpose;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) The Bill may be moved in either House of Parliament; (c) The Bill ought
			<lb />
			to be passed in each House by a majority of the total membership of that
			<lb />
			House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that
			<lb />
			House present and voting; (d) The Bill shall be presented to the President
			<lb />
			who shall give his assent to the Bill and thereupon the Constitution shall
			<lb />
			stand amended in accordance with the terms of that Bill.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			371. There is a proviso to Article 368 of the Constitution and for the
			<lb />
			present purposes, the further requirement is that &apos;if such amendment seeks to
			<lb />
			make any change&apos; in Chapter IV of Part V (The Union Judiciary) and
			<lb />
			Chapter V of Part VI (The High Courts in the States) the amendment &apos;shall
			<lb />
			also require to be ratified by the Legislatures of the States by resolution to
			<lb />
			that effect passed by those Legislatures before the Bill making provision for
			<lb />
			such amendment is presented to the President for assent.&apos;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			372. As far the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-first Amendment)
			<lb />
			Bill, 2014 is concerned, there is no doubt or dispute that the procedure
			<lb />
			mentioned above was followed and that it received the assent of the
			<lb />
			President on 31 st December, 2014. To that extent the Constitution
			<lb />
			(Ninety-ninth) Amendment Act, 2014 is a procedurally valid legislation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Limitations to amending the Constitution
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			373. To appreciate the inherent limitations placed on Parliament with
			<lb />
			regard to an amendment to the Constitution, it is necessary to consider the
			<lb />
			views constituting the majority in Kesavananda Bharati. In that case, the
			<lb />
			question before this Court (as framed by Chief Justice Sikri) was: What is
			<lb />
			the extent of the amending power conferred by Article 368 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, apart from Article 13(2) on Parliament?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			374. The learned Chief Justice noted that the word &apos;amendment&apos; has not
			<lb />
			been defined in the Constitution. In some provisions of the Constitution it
			<lb />
			has a narrow meaning, while in other provisions it has an expansive
			<lb />
			meaning. This view was expressed by Justice Shelat and Justice Grover as
			<lb />
			well, who observed that the words &apos;amendment&apos; and &apos;amend&apos; have been used
			<lb />
			to convey different meanings in different provisions of the Constitution. In
			<lb />
			some Articles these words have a narrow meaning while in others the
			<lb />
			meaning is much larger or broader. The word is not one of precise import
			<lb />
			and has not been used in different provisions of the Constitution to convey
			<lb />
			the same meaning. This is of some significance since it is on this basis that
			<lb />
			this Court referred to the CAD to interpret the words &apos;amendment&apos; and
			<lb />
			&apos;amend&apos;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			375. On a reading of various provisions of the Constitution the learned
			<lb />
			Chief Justice concluded that the expression &apos;amendment of this Constitution&apos;
			<lb />
			occurring in Article 368 thereof would mean any addition or change in any
			<lb />
			provision of the Constitution &apos;within the broad contours of the Preamble and
			<lb />
			the Constitution to carry out the objectives in the Preamble and the directive
			<lb />
			principles. Applied to fundamental rights, it would mean that while
			<lb />
			fundamental rights cannot be abrogated, reasonable abridgments of
			<lb />
			fundamental rights can be effected in the public interest.&apos; 566 In this context,
			<lb />
			the learned Chief Justice referred to the Universal Declaration of Human
			<lb />
			Rights to conclude that certain rights of individuals are inalienable. 567
			<lb />
			376. The learned Chief Justice concluded by holding, inter alia:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The expression &quot;amendment of this Constitution&quot; does not enable
			<lb />
			Parliament to abrogate or take away fundamental rights or to completely
			<lb />
			change the fundamental features of the Constitution so as to destroy its
			<lb />
			identity. Within these limits Parliament can amend every article.&quot; 568
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			377. Justice Shelat and Justice Grover looked at the text of Article 368 as it
			<lb />
			stood prior to its amendment by the 24 th Constitution Amendment Act and
			<lb />
			observed that there is intrinsic evidence to suggest that the amending power
			<lb />
			of Parliament is limited. However widely worded the power might be, it
			<lb />
			cannot be used to render the Constitution to lose its character or nature or
			<lb />
			identity and it has to be exercised within the framework of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			It was observed that an unlimited power of amendment cannot be conducive
			<lb />
			to the survival of the Constitution. On this basis, it was concluded that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The meaning of the words &quot;amendment of this Constitution&quot; as used in
			<lb />
			Article 368 must be such which accords with the true intention of the
			<lb />
			Constitution-makers as ascertainable from the historical background, the
			<lb />
			Preamble, the entire scheme of the Constitution, its structure and
			<lb />
			framework and the intrinsic evidence in various articles including Article
			<lb />
			368. It is neither possible to give it a narrow meaning nor can such a wide
			<lb />
			meaning be given which can enable the amending body to change
			<lb />
			substantially or entirely the structure and identity of the Constitution.&quot; 569
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			378. Justice Hegde and Justice Mukherjea observed that Article 368 cannot
			<lb />
			be interpreted in a narrow and pedantic manner but must be given a broad
			<lb />
			567 Article 8 and 10 of the UDHR are relevant in this regard:
			<lb />
			Article 8: Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for
			<lb />
			acts violating the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution or by law.
			<lb />
			Article 10: Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and
			<lb />
			impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.
			<lb />
			568 Paragraph 475
			<lb />
			569 Paragraph 546
			<lb />
			Page 783
			<lb />
			and liberal interpretation. It was observed that the word &apos;amendment&apos; has no
			<lb />
			precise meaning and that it is a &apos;colourless&apos; word. In fact, the words
			<lb />
			&apos;amendment&apos; and &apos;amend&apos; have been used in the Constitution in different
			<lb />
			places with different connotations. Notwithstanding this, the learned judges
			<lb />
			were of the view that the meaning of these expressions cannot be as
			<lb />
			expansive as to enable Parliament to change the &apos;personality&apos; of the
			<lb />
			Constitution since its scheme and structure proceed &apos;on the basis that there
			<lb />
			are certain basic features which are expected to be permanent.&apos; Therefore,
			<lb />
			the amending power under Article 368 of the Constitution is subject to
			<lb />
			implied limitations.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			379. Having considered all these factors, the learned judges concluded that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;On a careful consideration of the various aspects of the case, we are
			<lb />
			convinced that the Parliament has no power to abrogate or emasculate the
			<lb />
			basic elements or fundamental features of the Constitution such as the
			<lb />
			sovereignty of India, the democratic character of our polity, the unity of
			<lb />
			the country, the essential features of the individual freedoms secured to the
			<lb />
			citizens. Nor has the Parliament the power to revoke the mandate to build a
			<lb />
			welfare State and egalitarian society. These limitations are only illustrative
			<lb />
			and not exhaustive. Despite these limitations, however, there can be no
			<lb />
			question that the amending power is a wide power and it reaches every
			<lb />
			Article and every part of the Constitution. That power can be used to
			<lb />
			reshape the Constitution to fulfil the obligation imposed on the State. It can
			<lb />
			also be used to reshape the Constitution within the limits mentioned
			<lb />
			earlier, to make it an effective instrument for social good. We are unable to
			<lb />
			agree with the contention that in order to build a welfare State, it is
			<lb />
			necessary to destroy some of the human freedoms. That, at any rate is not
			<lb />
			the perspective of our Constitution.&quot; 570
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			380. Justice Khanna dwelt on the basic structure of the Constitution and
			<lb />
			expressed the view that &apos;amendment&apos; postulates the survival of the &apos;old&apos;
			<lb />
			Constitution without loss of its identity and the retention of the basic
			<lb />
			structure or framework of the &apos;old&apos; Constitution. It was held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Although it is permissible under the power of amendment to effect
			<lb />
			changes, howsoever important, and to adapt the system to the requirements
			<lb />
			of changing conditions, it is not permissible to touch the foundation or to
			<lb />
			alter the basic institutional pattern. The words &quot;amendment of the
			<lb />
			Constitution&quot; with all their wide sweep and amplitude cannot have the
			<lb />
			effect of destroying or abrogating the basic structure or framework of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			381. Thereafter, Justice Khanna travelled much further than necessary and
			<lb />
			held that as long as the basic structure and framework of the Constitution is
			<lb />
			retained, the plenary power of amendment &apos;would include within itself the
			<lb />
			power to add, alter or repeal the various articles including those relating to
			<lb />
			fundamental rights.&apos; The rationale for this was given a little later in the
			<lb />
			judgment in the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The word &quot;amendment&quot; in Article 368 must carry the same meaning
			<lb />
			whether the amendment relates to taking away or abridging fundamental
			<lb />
			rights in Part III of the Constitution or whether it pertains to some other
			<lb />
			provision outside Part III of the Constitution. No serious objection is taken
			<lb />
			to repeal, addition or alteration of provisions of the Constitution other than
			<lb />
			those in Part III under the power of amendment conferred by Article 368.
			<lb />
			The same approach, in my opinion, should hold good when we deal with
			<lb />
			amendment relating to fundamental rights contained in Part III of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. It would be impermissible to differentiate between scope and
			<lb />
			width of power of amendment when it deals with fundamental right, and
			<lb />
			the scope and width of that power when it deals with provisions not
			<lb />
			concerned with fundamental rights.&quot; 571
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			382. The conclusion arrived at by Justice Khanna is stated by the learned
			<lb />
			judge in the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The power of amendment under Article 368 does not include the power to
			<lb />
			abrogate the Constitution nor does it include the power to alter the basic
			<lb />
			structure or framework of the Constitution. Subject to the retention of the
			<lb />
			basic structure or framework of the Constitution, the power of amendment
			<lb />
			is plenary and includes within itself the power to amend the various
			<lb />
			articles of the Constitution, including those relating to fundamental rights
			<lb />
			as well as those which may be said to relate to essential features. No part
			<lb />
			of a fundamental right can claim immunity from amendatory process by
			<lb />
			being described as the essence, or core of that right. The power of
			<lb />
			amendment would also include within itself the power to add, alter or
			<lb />
			repeal the various articles.&quot; 572
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			383. It may be mentioned en passant that the aforesaid view expressed by
			<lb />
			Justice Khanna generated much controversy. That was adverted to by the
			<lb />
			learned judge in Indira Nehru Gandhi and it was clarified in paragraphs 251
			<lb />
			and 252 of the Report that the &apos;offending&apos; passages were in the context of the
			<lb />
			extent of the amending power and not in the context of the basic structure of
			<lb />
			the Constitution. The learned judge clarified that fundamental rights were a
			<lb />
			part of the basic structure of the Constitution but the right to property was
			<lb />
			not. 573
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			384. Simplistically put, the sum and substance of the decision in
			<lb />
			Kesavananda Bharati is that it recognized that the Constitution has a basic
			<lb />
			structure and that the basic structure of the Constitution is unalterable.
			<lb />
			Perhaps to avoid any doubts and since as many as nine judgments were
			<lb />
			delivered by the thirteen judges constituting the Bench, a summary of the
			<lb />
			conclusions was prepared. This summary was signed by nine of the thirteen
			<lb />
			judges. Among the nine signatories were two learned judges who were in the
			<lb />
			minority. One of the conclusions agreed upon by the nine learned judges who
			<lb />
			signed the summary was: &apos;Article 368 does not enable Parliament to alter the
			<lb />
			basic structure or framework of the Constitution.&apos;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Judicial review of an amendment to the Constitution
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			385. In Indira Nehru Gandhi it was held that an amendment to the
			<lb />
			Constitution can be challenged only on the ground of violation of the basic
			<lb />
			structure, while a statute cannot be so challenged. A statute can be
			<lb />
			challenged only if it is passed by a Legislature beyond its legislative
			<lb />
			competence or if it offends Article 13 of the Constitution. 574
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The constitutional amendments may, on the ratio of the Fundamental
			<lb />
			Rights case, 575 be tested on the anvil of basic structure. But apart from the
			<lb />
			principle that a case is only an authority for what it decides, it does not
			<lb />
			logically follow from the majority judgment in the Fundamental Rights
			<lb />
			case that ordinary legislation must also answer the same test as a
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment. Ordinary laws have to answer two tests for their
			<lb />
			validity: (1) The law must be within the legislative competence of the
			<lb />
			legislature as defined and specified in Chapter I, Part XI of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, and (2) it must not offend against the provisions of Article
			<lb />
			13(1) and (2) of the Constitution. &quot;Basic structure&quot;, by the majority
			<lb />
			judgment, is not a part of the fundamental rights nor indeed a provision of
			<lb />
			the Constitution. The theory of basic structure is woven out of the
			<lb />
			conspectus of the Constitution and the amending power is subjected to it
			<lb />
			because it is a constituent power. &quot;The power to amend the fundamental
			<lb />
			instrument cannot carry with it the power to destroy its essential features
			<lb />
			-this, in brief, is the arch of the theory of basic structure. It is wholly out
			<lb />
			of place in matters relating to the validity of ordinary laws made under the
			<lb />
			Constitution.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			386. A similar view was taken in State of Karnataka v. Union of India 576
			<lb />
			wherein the above passage from Indira Nehru Gandhi was quoted with
			<lb />
			574 13. Laws inconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights -(1) All laws in force in the
			<lb />
			territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they are
			<lb />
			inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2) The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part
			<lb />
			and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(3) In this article, unless the context otherwise requires,-
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(a) &quot;law&quot; includes any Ordinance, order, bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage
			<lb />
			having in the territory of India the force of law;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(b) &quot;laws in force&quot; includes laws passed or made by a Legislature or other competent authority in
			<lb />
			the territory of India before the commencement of this Constitution and not previously repealed,
			<lb />
			notwithstanding that any such law or any part thereof may not be then in operation either at all or
			<lb />
			in particular areas.
			<lb />
			(4) Nothing in this article shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made under Article
			<lb />
			368.

			approval. It was said by Justice Untwalia in a concurring judgment for
			<lb />
			himself, Justice Shinghal and Justice Jaswant Singh:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Mr. Sinha also contended that an ordinary law cannot go against the basic
			<lb />
			scheme or the fundamental backbone of the Centre-State relationship as
			<lb />
			enshrined in the Constitution. He put his argument in this respect in a very
			<lb />
			ingenious way because he felt difficulty in placing it in a direct manner by
			<lb />
			saying that an ordinary law cannot violate the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. In the case of Smt Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Shri Raj Narain
			<lb />
			such an argument was expressly rejected by this Court. We may rest
			<lb />
			content by referring to a passage from the judgment of our learned brother
			<lb />
			Chandrachud, J. which runs thus………..&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			387. In Kuldip Nayar v. Union of India 577 a Constitution Bench reiterated
			<lb />
			the above view in the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The basic structure theory imposes limitation on the power of Parliament
			<lb />
			to amend the Constitution. An amendment to the Constitution under Article
			<lb />
			368 could be challenged on the ground of violation of the basic structure of
			<lb />
			the Constitution. An ordinary legislation cannot be so challenged. The
			<lb />
			challenge to a law made, within its legislative competence, by Parliament
			<lb />
			on the ground of violation of the basic structure of the Constitution is thus
			<lb />
			not available to the petitioners.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			388. Finally, in Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India 578 it was held
			<lb />
			that a law can be challenged if it violates a provision of the Constitution but
			<lb />
			an amendment to the Constitution can be challenged only if it violates a
			<lb />
			basic feature of the Constitution which is a part of its basic structure. It was
			<lb />
			held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;For determining whether a particular feature of the Constitution is part of
			<lb />
			the basic structure or not, it has to be examined in each individual case
			<lb />
			keeping in mind the scheme of the Constitution, its objects and purpose
			<lb />
			and the integrity of the Constitution as a fundamental instrument for the
			<lb />
			country&apos;s governance. It may be noticed that it is not open to challenge the
			<lb />
			ordinary legislations on the basis of the basic structure principle. State
			<lb />
			legislation can be challenged on the question whether it is violative of the
			<lb />
			provisions of the Constitution. But as regards constitutional amendments,
			<lb />
			if any challenge is made on the basis of basic structure, it has to be
			<lb />
			examined based on the basic features of the Constitution.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			389. A different opinion was expressed in Madras Bar Association v.
			<lb />
			Union of India 579 wherein it was held that the view that an amendment to the
			<lb />
			Constitution can be challenged on the ground of violation of the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution is made applicable to legislation also. This was
			<lb />
			assumed to be a logical extension of a principle. It was held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;This Court has repeatedly held that an amendment to the provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution would not be sustainable if it violated the &quot;basic structure&quot; of
			<lb />
			the Constitution, even though the amendment had been carried out by
			<lb />
			following the procedure contemplated under &quot;Part XI&quot; of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			This leads to the determination that the &quot;basic structure&quot; is inviolable. In
			<lb />
			our view, the same would apply to all other legislations (other than
			<lb />
			amendments to the Constitution) as well, even though the legislation had
			<lb />
			been enacted by following the prescribed procedure, and was within the
			<lb />
			domain of the enacting legislature, any infringement to the &quot;basic
			<lb />
			structure&quot; would be unacceptable.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			390. For the purposes of the present discussion, I would prefer to follow the
			<lb />
			view expressed by a Bench of seven learned judges in State of Karnataka v.
			<lb />
			Union of India that it is only an amendment of the Constitution that can be
			<lb />
			challenged on the ground that it violates the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution -a statute cannot be challenged on the ground that it violates
			<lb />
			the basic structure of the Constitution. [The only exception to this perhaps
			<lb />
			could be a statute placed in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution]. The
			<lb />
			principles for challenging the constitutionality of a statute are quite different.
			<lb />
			Challenge to the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act -the preliminaries
			<lb />
			(a) Limitations to the challenge
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			391. The first submission made by the learned Attorney-General for
			<lb />
			upholding the constitutionality of the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act was
			<lb />
			on the basis of Kesavananda Bharati. It was submitted that a Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act can be challenged as violating the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution within limited parameters, that is, only if it &apos;emasculates&apos; the
			<lb />
			Constitution, or &apos;abrogates&apos; it or completely changes its fundamental features
			<lb />
			so as to destroy its identity or personality or shakes the pillars on which it
			<lb />
			rests. While accepting that the independence of the judiciary is one such
			<lb />
			pillar, it was submitted that a change in the method and procedure in the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court or a High Court does not
			<lb />
			emasculate, abrogate or shake the foundations or the pillars of the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary. Consequently the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act does not fall foul of the basic structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			392. This argument fails to appreciate that a majority of the learned judges
			<lb />
			constituting the Bench that decided Kesavananda Bharati were of the
			<lb />
			opinion that it is enough to declare a constitutional amendment as violating
			<lb />
			the basic structure if it alters the basic structure. Undoubtedly, some of the
			<lb />
			learned judges have used very strong words in the course of their judgment -
			<lb />
			emasculate, destroy, abrogate, and substantially change the identity etc. but
			<lb />
			when it came to stating what is the law actually laid down, the majority
			<lb />
			decided that &apos;Article 368 does not enable Parliament to alter the basic
			<lb />
			structure or framework of the Constitution.&apos; 580
			<lb />
			393. This was reiterated and explained by Justice Khanna in Indira Nehru
			<lb />
			Gandhi. The words &apos;destroy&apos; and &apos;abrogate&apos; etc. were used with reference to
			<lb />
			the words &apos;amendment&apos; and &apos;amendment of the Constitution&apos; which is to say
			<lb />
			that &apos;amendment&apos; and &apos;amendment of the Constitution&apos; cannot be interpreted
			<lb />
			expansively as meaning &apos;destroy&apos; or &apos;abrogate&apos; etc. but have a limited
			<lb />
			meaning. The words &apos;destroy&apos; and &apos;abrogate&apos; etc. were not used in the
			<lb />
			context of destroying or abrogating the basic structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			The learned judge clearly said that &apos;the power of amendment under Article
			<lb />
			368 [of the Constitution] does not enable the Parliament to alter the basic
			<lb />
			structure of [or] framework of the Constitution….&apos; In fact, this was the
			<lb />
			precise submission of learned counsel for the election petitioner, namely, that
			<lb />
			the constitutional amendment &apos;affects the basic structure or framework of the
			<lb />
			Constitution and is, therefore, beyond the amending power under Article 368
			<lb />
			[of the Constitution].&apos; 581 The learned judge explained this crucial distinction
			<lb />
			in the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The proposition that the power of amendment under Article 368 does not
			<lb />
			enable Parliament to alter the basic structure of framework of the
			<lb />
			Constitution was laid down by this Court by a majority of 7 to 6 in the case
			<lb />
			of His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala. Apart from other
			<lb />
			reasons which were given in some of the judgments of the learned Judges
			<lb />
			who constituted the majority, the majority dealt with the connotation of the
			<lb />
			word &quot;amendment&quot;. It was held that the words &quot;amendment of the
			<lb />
			Constitution&quot; in Article 368 could not have the effect of destroying or
			<lb />
			abrogating the basic structure of the Constitution. Some of us who were
			<lb />
			parties to that case took a different view and came to the conclusion that
			<lb />
			the words &quot;amendment of the Constitution&quot; in Article 368 did not admit of
			<lb />
			any limitation. Those of us who were in the minority in Kesavananda case
			<lb />
			may still hold the same view as was given expression to in that case. For
			<lb />
			the purpose of the present case, we shall have to proceed in accordance
			<lb />
			with the law as laid down by the majority in that case.&quot; 582
			<lb />
			394. While dealing with the constitutional validity of Clause (4) of Article
			<lb />
			329-A of the Constitution as introduced by the 39 th Constitution Amendment
			<lb />
			Act, Justice Khanna expressed the view that if a principle, imperative rule or
			<lb />
			postulate of the basic structure of the Constitution is violated, then the
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment loses its immunity from attack.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;The question to be decided is that if the impugned amendment of the
			<lb />
			Constitution violates a principle which is part of the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, can it enjoy immunity from an attack on its validity because
			<lb />
			of the fact that for the future, the basic structure of the Constitution
			<lb />
			remains unaffected. The answer to the above question, in my opinion,
			<lb />
			should be in the negative. What has to be seen in such a matter is whether
			<lb />
			the amendment contravenes or runs counter to an imperative rule or
			<lb />
			postulate which is an integral part of the basic structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			If so, it would be an impermissible amendment and it would make no
			<lb />
			difference whether it relates to one case or a large number of cases. If an
			<lb />
			amendment striking at the basic structure of the Constitution is not
			<lb />
			permissible, it would not acquire validity by being related only to one case.
			<lb />
			To accede to the argument advanced in support of the validity of the
			<lb />
			amendment would be tantamount to holding that even though it is not
			<lb />
			permissible to change the basic structure of the Constitution, whenever the
			<lb />
			authority concerned deems it proper to make such an amendment, it can do
			<lb />
			so and circumvent the bar to the making of such an amendment by
			<lb />
			confining it to one case. What is prohibited cannot become permissible
			<lb />
			because of its being confined to one matter.&quot; 583
			<lb />
			In conclusion it was said by Justice Khanna as follows:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;As a result of the above, I strike down clause (4) of Article 329-A on the
			<lb />
			ground that it violates the principle of free and fair elections which is an
			<lb />
			essential postulate of democracy and which in its turn is a part of the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution inasmuch as (1) it abolishes the forum without
			<lb />
			providing for another forum for going into the dispute relating to the
			<lb />
			validity of the election of the appellant and further prescribes that the said
			<lb />
			dispute shall not be governed by any election law and that the validity of
			<lb />
			the said election shall be absolute and not consequently be liable to be
			<lb />
			assailed, and (2) it extinguishes both the right and the remedy to challenge
			<lb />
			the validity of the aforesaid election.&quot; 584
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			395. Similarly, Justice K.K. Mathew who was in the minority in
			<lb />
			Kesavananda Bharati expressed the view (in Indira Nehru Gandhi) that the
			<lb />
			majority decision was that by an amendment, the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution cannot be damaged or destroyed, and the learned judge
			<lb />
			proceeded on that basis and held that Clause (4) of Article 329-A of the
			<lb />
			Constitution as introduced by the 39 th Constitution Amendment Act damaged
			<lb />
			or destroyed the basic structure of the Constitution. 585
			<lb />
			396. Justice Y.V. Chandrachud who too was in the minority in
			<lb />
			Kesavananda Bharati took the view that according to the majority opinion
			<lb />
			in that decision the principle that emerged was that Article 368 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution &apos;does not confer power on Parliament to alter the basic structure
			<lb />
			or framework of the Constitution.&apos; 586 The learned judge further said that the
			<lb />
			ratio decidendi in Kesavananda Bharati was that &apos;the power of amendment
			<lb />
			[in Article 368 of the Constitution] cannot be exercised to damage or destroy
			<lb />
			the essential elements or basic structure of the Constitution, whatever these
			<lb />
			expressions may comprehend.&apos; 587
			<lb />
			397. The issue again came up for consideration in Minerva Mills v. Union
			<lb />
			of India. 588 The question in that case was whether Section 4 and Section 55
			<lb />
			of the 42 nd Constitution Amendment Act transgress the limitation of the
			<lb />
			amending power of Article 368 of the Constitution. Speaking for himself and
			<lb />
			the other learned judges in the majority (Justice A.C Gupta, Justice N.L.
			<lb />
			Untwalia and Justice P.S. Kailasam) it was held by Chief Justice
			<lb />
			Chandrachud that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;In Kesavananda Bharati, this Court held by a majority that though by
			<lb />
			Article 368 Parliament is given the power to amend the Constitution, that
			<lb />
			power cannot be exercised so as to damage the basic features of the
			<lb />
			Constitution or so as to destroy its basic structure. The question for
			<lb />
			consideration in this group of petitions under Article 32 is whether
			<lb />
			Sections 4 and 55 of the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976
			<lb />
			transgress that limitation on the amending power.&quot; 589
			<lb />
			A little later in the judgment, it was held as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The summary of the various judgments in Kesavananda Bharati was
			<lb />
			signed by nine out of the thirteen Judges. Para 2 of the summary reads to
			<lb />
			say that according to the majority, &quot;Article 368 does not enable Parliament
			<lb />
			to alter the basic structure or framework of the Constitution&quot;. Whether or
			<lb />
			not the summary is a legitimate part of the judgment, or is per incuriam for
			<lb />
			the scholarly reasons cited by authors, it is undeniable that it correctly
			<lb />
			reflects the majority view.
			<lb />
			The question which we have to determine on the basis of the majority view
			<lb />
			in Kesavananda Bharati is whether the amendments introduced by
			<lb />
			Sections 4 and 55 of the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976
			<lb />
			damage the basic structure of the Constitution by destroying any of its
			<lb />
			basic features or essential elements.&quot; 590
			<lb />
			It appears from the above exposition of the ratio decidendi in Kesavananda
			<lb />
			Bharati that the words &apos;alter&apos; and &apos;damage&apos; are used interchangeably.
			<lb />
			Similarly, &apos;damage the basic features&apos; and &apos;destroy the basic structure&apos; are
			<lb />
			used interchangeably with &apos;damage the basic structure&apos; and &apos;destroy the
			<lb />
			basic features&apos;. 591 The bottom line is what is contained in the &apos;summary&apos; of
			<lb />
			Kesavananda Bharati, namely: Article 368 does not enable Parliament to
			<lb />
			alter the basic structure or framework of the Constitution. There are two
			<lb />
			reasons for this. Firstly, it is a contemporaneous exposition of the views of
			<lb />
			the majority in Kesavananda Bharati and there is no other or different
			<lb />
			589 Paragraph 1
			<lb />
			590 Paragraphs 12 and 13
			<lb />
			591 I am unable to agree with Justice Chelameswar when he says that the &apos;basic structure&apos; and &apos;basic
			<lb />
			features&apos; convey different ideas. Lexicographically -yes, but constitutionally speaking -no. they are two
			<lb />
			dimensions of the same picture. In any event, for the present discussion, the distinction, if any, is not
			<lb />
			relevant.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Page 794
			<lb />
			exposition and secondly, the exposition is by the majority of judges
			<lb />
			themselves (including two in the minority) and by no other.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			398. It may be mentioned that some misgivings were expressed &apos;about&apos;
			<lb />
			Minerva Mills in Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing Co. v. Bharat Coking Coal
			<lb />
			Ltd. 592 The misgivings were not spelt out by the Bench except that it is stated
			<lb />
			that the case &apos;has left us perplexed&apos; seemingly for the reason that no question
			<lb />
			had arisen regarding the constitutional validity of Section 4 and Section 55
			<lb />
			of the 42 nd Constitution Amendment Act. 593 This is rather odd since the
			<lb />
			majority decision in Minerva Mills begins by stating: &apos;The question for
			<lb />
			consideration in this group of petitions under Article 32 is whether Sections
			<lb />
			4 and 55 of the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976 transgress that
			<lb />
			limitation on the amending power.&apos; Justice Bhagwati who partly dissented
			<lb />
			from the views of the majority also stated that the constitutional validity of
			<lb />
			Sections 4 and 55 of the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976 were
			<lb />
			under challenge. 594 However, it is not necessary to enter into this thicket, but
			<lb />
			it must be noted that Sanjeev Coke did not disagree with Minerva Mills in
			<lb />
			its understanding of Kesavananda Bharati.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			399. More recently, in M. Nagaraj v. Union of India 595 it was held
			<lb />
			(rephrasing Justice Khanna in Indira Nehru Gandhi) that the basic structure
			<lb />
			doctrine is really a check on the amending power of Parliament. The basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution consists of constitutional principles that are so
			<lb />
			fundamental that they limit the amending power of Parliament. It was
			<lb />
			concluded that the basic structure theory is based on the concept of
			<lb />
			constitutional identity (rephrasing Justice Bhagwati in Minerva Mills). It
			<lb />
			was then said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The basic structure jurisprudence is a preoccupation with constitutional
			<lb />
			identity. In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala it has been observed
			<lb />
			that &quot;one cannot legally use the Constitution to destroy itself&quot;. It is further
			<lb />
			observed &quot;the personality of the Constitution must remain unchanged&quot;.
			<lb />
			Therefore, this Court in Kesavananda Bharati while propounding the
			<lb />
			theory of basic structure, has relied upon the doctrine of constitutional
			<lb />
			identity. The word &quot;amendment&quot; postulates that the old Constitution
			<lb />
			survives without loss of its identity despite the change and it continues
			<lb />
			even though it has been subjected to alteration. This is the constant theme
			<lb />
			of the opinions in the majority decision in Kesavananda Bharati. To
			<lb />
			destroy its identity is to abrogate the basic structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			This is the principle of constitutional sovereignty…... The main object
			<lb />
			behind the theory of the constitutional identity is continuity and within that
			<lb />
			continuity of identity, changes are admissible depending upon the situation
			<lb />
			and circumstances of the day.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			400. The &apos;controversy&apos; is now set at rest with the decision rendered in I.R.
			<lb />
			Coelho where alteration of the basic structure has been accepted as the test to
			<lb />
			determine the constitutional validity of an amendment to the Constitution. It
			<lb />
			was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The decision in Kesavananda Bharati case was rendered on 24-4-1973 by
			<lb />
			a thirteen-Judge Bench and by majority of seven to six Golak Nath case 596
			<lb />
			was overruled. The majority opinion held that Article 368 did not enable
			<lb />
			Parliament to alter the basic structure or framework of the Constitution.&quot; 597
			<lb />
			And again,
			<lb />
			&quot;In Kesavananda Bharati case the majority held that the power of
			<lb />
			amendment of the Constitution under Article 368 did not enable
			<lb />
			Parliament to alter the basic structure of the Constitution.&quot; 598
			<lb />
			The attack, therefore, is not on the basic structure of the Constitution but on
			<lb />
			the amending power of Parliament.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			401. The learned Attorney-General placed reliance on the following
			<lb />
			passage from the judgment of Justice Krishna Iyer in Bhim Singhji v. Union
			<lb />
			of India 599 to contend that for a constitutional amendment to violate the basic
			<lb />
			structure, it must be shocking, unconscionable or an unscrupulous travesty of
			<lb />
			the quintessence of equal justice. That case dealt with the constitutional
			<lb />
			validity of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 which was
			<lb />
			placed in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution by the 40 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act, 1976 and therefore had the protection of Article 31-B and
			<lb />
			Article 31-C of the Constitution. In that context, it was held that the question
			<lb />
			of the basic structure of the Constitution does not arise if the constitutional
			<lb />
			validity of legislation (as distinguished from a constitutional amendment) is
			<lb />
			under challenge. It was then said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The question of basic structure being breached cannot arise when we
			<lb />
			examine the vires of an ordinary legislation as distinguished from a
			<lb />
			constitutional amendment. Kesavananda Bharati cannot be the last refuge
			<lb />
			of the proprietariat when benign legislation takes away their &quot;excess&quot; for
			<lb />
			societal weal. Nor, indeed, can every breach of equality spell disaster as a
			<lb />
			lethal violation of the basic structure. Peripheral inequality is inevitable
			<lb />
			when large-scale equalisation processes are put into action. If all the
			<lb />
			Judges of the Supreme Court in solemn session sit and deliberate for half a
			<lb />
			year to produce a legislation for reducing glaring economic inequality their
			<lb />
			genius will let them down if the essay is to avoid even peripheral
			<lb />
			inequalities. Every large cause claims some martyr, as sociologists will
			<lb />
			know. Therefore, what is a betrayal of the basic feature is not a mere
			<lb />
			violation of Article 14 but a shocking, unconscionable or unscrupulous
			<lb />
			travesty of the quintessence of equal justice. If a legislation does go that
			<lb />
			far it shakes the democratic foundation and must suffer the death
			<lb />
			penalty.&quot; 600
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			402. This decision dealt with a statute placed in the Ninth Schedule of the
			<lb />
			Constitution and is, therefore, a class apart as far as the present discussion is
			<lb />
			concerned.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			403. From this analysis, it must be concluded that if a constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment alters the basic structure of the Constitution, then it can and
			<lb />
			should be declared unconstitutional. What is of importance is the &apos;width of
			<lb />
			power&apos; test propounded by Mr. Palkhivala in Kesavananda Bharati and
			<lb />
			adopted in M. Nagaraj and now rechristened in I.R. Coelho as the direct
			<lb />
			impact and effect test &apos;which means the form of an amendment is not
			<lb />
			relevant, its consequence would be [the] determinative factor.&apos; 601
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			404. In the light of the above discussion the question, therefore, is this:
			<lb />
			How does the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act alter the basic structure of
			<lb />
			the Constitution, if at all? There is no doubt or dispute that the independence
			<lb />
			of the judiciary is a basic structure of the Constitution. I have already held
			<lb />
			that the appointment of a judge to the Supreme Court and a High Court is an
			<lb />
			integral part of the independence of the judiciary. Therefore, has the
			<lb />
			introduction of the National Judicial Appointments Commission by the 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act so altered the appointment process as to impact
			<lb />
			on the independence of the judiciary thereby making the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act unconstitutional? The learned Attorney-General
			<lb />
			answered this in the negative.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) Presumption of constitutionality
			<lb />
			405. The learned Attorney-General submitted that there is a presumption in
			<lb />
			law that the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act is constitutionally valid and
			<lb />
			that the petitioners have not been able to rebut that presumption.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			406. In Charanjit Lal Chowdhuri v. Union of India 602 Justice Fazal Ali
			<lb />
			expressed the view that &apos;the presumption is always in favour of the
			<lb />
			constitutionality of an enactment.&apos;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			407. Similarly, in Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Justice S.R. Tendolkar 603 it was
			<lb />
			held, on a consideration of the decisions of this Court by Chief Justice S.R.
			<lb />
			Das that &apos;there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of
			<lb />
			an enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there
			<lb />
			has been a clear transgressions of the constitutional principles.&apos;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			408. In Kesavananda Bharati it was held by Justice Hegde and Justice
			<lb />
			Mukherjea that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;But the courts generally proceed on the presumption of constitutionality
			<lb />
			of all legislations. The presumption of the constitutional validity of a
			<lb />
			statute will also apply to constitutional amendments.&quot; 604
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			409. Finally, in R.K. Garg v. Union of India 605 it was held by Justice
			<lb />
			Bhagwati, speaking for the Court as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Now while considering the constitutional validity of a statute said to be
			<lb />
			violative of Article 14, it is necessary to bear in mind certain well
			<lb />
			established principles which have been evolved by the courts as rules of
			<lb />
			guidance in discharge of its constitutional function of judicial review. The
			<lb />
			first rule is that there is always a presumption in favour of the
			<lb />
			constitutionality of a statute and the burden is upon him who attacks it to
			<lb />
			show that there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional
			<lb />
			principles. This rule is based on the assumption, judicially recognised and
			<lb />
			accepted, that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the
			<lb />
			needs of its own people, its laws are directed to problems made manifest
			<lb />
			by experience and its discrimination are based on adequate grounds. The
			<lb />
			presumption of constitutionality is indeed so strong that in order to sustain
			<lb />
			it, the Court may take into consideration matters of common knowledge,
			<lb />
			matters of common report, the history of the times and may assume every
			<lb />
			state of facts which can be conceived existing at the time of legislation.&quot; 606
			<lb />
			410. It is not possible to disagree with the learned Attorney-General in this
			<lb />
			regard. A statute or a constitutional amendment must always be deemed to
			<lb />
			be constitutionally valid and it is for those challenging the validity to
			<lb />
			demonstrate a violation of the Constitution or an alteration of the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution, as the case may be. As far as the petitioners are
			<lb />
			concerned, it is for them to conclusively show that the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act alters the basic structure of the Constitution in that it
			<lb />
			replaces a well thought-out and fully-discussed method of appointment of
			<lb />
			judges with another wherein the constitutional role giving significant value
			<lb />
			to the opinion of the Chief Justice of India is substantively diminished or
			<lb />
			perhaps eliminated and substituted by the NJAC. The question is not whether
			<lb />
			the alternative model is good or not good but whether it is constitutionally
			<lb />
			valid or not.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(c) Basis of judgment is removed
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			411. The third submission was that Article 124(2) of the Constitution has
			<lb />
			been amended by the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and, therefore, the
			<lb />
			basis of the judgment delivered by this Court in the Second Judges case has
			<lb />
			been completely taken away or that the Constitution has been amended with
			<lb />
			the result that that judgment cannot now be used to interpret Article 124(2)
			<lb />
			of the Constitution as it is today. In other words, the challenge to the 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act will have to be adjudicated independently and
			<lb />
			regardless of the law laid down in the Second Judges case or the Third
			<lb />
			Judges case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			412. In Shri Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. v. Broach Borough Municipality 607
			<lb />
			it was said by Chief Justice Hidayatullah that granted legislative competence,
			<lb />
			it is not sufficient to declare merely that the decision of the Court shall not
			<lb />
			bind for that is tantamount to reversing the decision in exercise of judicial
			<lb />
			power which the Legislature does not possess or exercise. A Court&apos;s decision
			<lb />
			must always bind unless the conditions on which it is based are so
			<lb />
			fundamentally altered that the decision could not have been given in the
			<lb />
			altered circumstances. It was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Granted legislative competence, it is not sufficient to declare merely that
			<lb />
			the decision of the Court shall not bind for that is tantamount to reversing
			<lb />
			the decision in exercise of judicial power which the Legislature does not
			<lb />
			possess or exercise. A court&apos;s decision must always bind unless the
			<lb />
			conditions on which it is based are so fundamentally altered that the
			<lb />
			decision could not have been given in the altered circumstances.
			<lb />
			Ordinarily, a court holds a tax to be invalidly imposed because the power
			<lb />
			to tax is wanting or the statute or the rules or both are invalid or do not
			<lb />
			sufficiently create the jurisdiction. Validation of a tax so declared illegal
			<lb />
			may be done only if the grounds of illegality or invalidity are capable of
			<lb />
			being removed and are in fact removed and the tax thus made legal.
			<lb />
			Sometimes this is done by providing for jurisdiction where jurisdiction had
			<lb />
			not been properly invested before. Sometimes this is done by re-enacting
			<lb />
			retrospectively a valid and legal taxing provision and then by fiction
			<lb />
			making the tax already collected to stand under the re-enacted law.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Sometimes the Legislature gives its own meaning and interpretation of the
			<lb />
			law under which tax was collected and by legislative fiat makes the new
			<lb />
			meaning binding upon courts. The Legislature may follow any one method
			<lb />
			or all of them and while it does so it may neutralise the effect of the earlier
			<lb />
			decision of the court which becomes ineffective after the change of the
			<lb />
			law. Whichever method is adopted it must be within the competence of the
			<lb />
			legislature and legal and adequate to attain the object of validation.&quot; 608
			<lb />
			413. Similarly, in Indira Nehru Gandhi it was held by Chief Justice Ray as
			<lb />
			follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The effect of validation is to change the law so as to alter the basis of any
			<lb />
			judgment, which might have been given on the basis of old law and thus
			<lb />
			make the judgment ineffective. A formal declaration that the judgment
			<lb />
			rendered under the old Act is void, is not necessary. If the matter is
			<lb />
			pending in appeal, the appellate court has to give effect to the altered law
			<lb />
			and reverse the judgment. The rendering of a judgment ineffective by
			<lb />
			changing its basis by legislative enactment is not an encroachment on
			<lb />
			judicial power but a legislation within the competence of the Legislature
			<lb />
			rendering the basis of the judgment non est.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			414. In K. Sankaran Nair v. Devaki Amma Malathy Amma 609 it was
			<lb />
			observed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It is now well settled that the legislature cannot overrule any judicial
			<lb />
			decision without removing the substratum or the foundation of that
			<lb />
			judgment by a retrospective amendment of the legal provision concerned.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			610
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			It was further stated, relying upon Shri Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It is now well settled by a catena of decisions of this Court that unless the
			<lb />
			legislature by enacting a competent legislative provision retrospectively
			<lb />
			removes the substratum or foundation of any judgment of a competent
			<lb />
			court the said judgment would remain binding and operative and in the
			<lb />
			absence of such a legislative exercise by a competent legislature the
			<lb />
			attempt to upset the binding effect of such judgments rendered against the
			<lb />
			parties would remain an incompetent and forbidden exercise which could
			<lb />
			be dubbed as an abortive attempt to legislatively overrule binding
			<lb />
			decisions of courts.&quot; 611
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			415. Similarly, in Bhubaneshwar Singh v. Union of India 612 reliance was
			<lb />
			placed on Shri Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. and a host of other decisions
			<lb />
			rendered by this Court and a similar conclusion arrived at in the following
			<lb />
			words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;From time to time controversy has arisen as to whether the effect of
			<lb />
			judicial pronouncements of the High Court or the Supreme Court can be
			<lb />
			wiped out by amending the legislation with retrospective effect. Many
			<lb />
			such Amending Acts are called Validating Acts, validating the action taken
			<lb />
			under the particular enactments by removing the defect in the statute
			<lb />
			retrospectively because of which the statute or the part of it had been
			<lb />
			declared ultra vires. Such exercise has been held by this Court as not to
			<lb />
			amount to encroachment on the judicial power of the courts. The exercise
			<lb />
			of rendering ineffective the judgments or orders of competent courts by
			<lb />
			changing the very basis by legislation is a well-known device of validating
			<lb />
			legislation. This Court has repeatedly pointed out that such validating
			<lb />
			legislation which removes the cause of the invalidity cannot be considered
			<lb />
			to be an encroachment on judicial power. At the same time, any action in
			<lb />
			exercise of the power under any enactment which has been declared to be
			<lb />
			invalid by a court cannot be made valid by a Validating Act by merely
			<lb />
			saying so unless the defect which has been pointed out by the court is
			<lb />
			removed with retrospective effect. The validating legislation must remove
			<lb />
			the cause of invalidity. Till such defect or the lack of authority pointed out
			<lb />
			by the court under a statute is removed by the subsequent enactment with
			<lb />
			retrospective effect, the binding nature of the judgment of the court cannot
			<lb />
			be ignored.&quot; 613
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			416. In Re Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal 614 it was pithily stated, on a
			<lb />
			review of several decisions of this Court that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The principle which emerges from these authorities is that the legislature
			<lb />
			can change the basis on which a decision is given by the Court and thus
			<lb />
			change the law in general, which will affect a class of persons and events
			<lb />
			at large. It cannot, however, set aside an individual decision inter partes
			<lb />
			and affect their rights and liabilities alone. Such an act on the part of the
			<lb />
			legislature amounts to exercising the judicial power of the State and to
			<lb />
			functioning as an appellate court or tribunal.&quot; 615
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			417. More recently, in State of Tamil Nadu this Court approved the
			<lb />
			following conclusion arrived at in Indian Aluminium Co. v. State of
			<lb />
			Kerala 616 :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;In exercising legislative power, the legislature by mere declaration,
			<lb />
			without anything more, cannot directly overrule, revise or override a
			<lb />
			judicial decision. It can render judicial decision ineffective by enacting
			<lb />
			valid law on the topic within its legislative field fundamentally altering or
			<lb />
			changing its character retrospectively. The changed or altered conditions
			<lb />
			are such that the previous decision would not have been rendered by the
			<lb />
			court, if those conditions had existed at the time of declaring the law as
			<lb />
			invalid. It is also empowered to give effect to retrospective legislation with
			<lb />
			a deeming date or with effect from a particular date. The legislature can
			<lb />
			change the character of the tax or duty from impermissible to permissible
			<lb />
			tax but the tax or levy should answer such character and the legislature is
			<lb />
			competent to recover the invalid tax validating such a tax on removing the
			<lb />
			invalid base for recovery from the subject or render the recovery from the
			<lb />
			State ineffectual. It is competent for the legislature to enact the law with
			<lb />
			retrospective effect and authorise its agencies to levy and collect the tax on
			<lb />
			that basis, make the imposition of levy collected and recovery of the tax
			<lb />
			made valid, notwithstanding the declaration by the court or the direction
			<lb />
			given for recovery thereof.&quot; 617
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			418. Without commenting on the view canvassed by the learned
			<lb />
			Attorney-General that the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act has actually
			<lb />
			removed the basis of the judgment delivered by this Court in the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case the constitutional validity of the said amendment will
			<lb />
			nevertheless need to be tested on that assumption, keeping in mind the above
			<lb />
			decisions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(d) Wisdom of an amendment to the Constitution
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			419. The next submission of the learned Attorney-General was that the
			<lb />
			wisdom of Parliament in enacting the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act
			<lb />
			cannot be disputed. Hence, this Court ought not to substitute its own views
			<lb />
			on the necessity or otherwise of the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act over
			<lb />
			the law laid down in the Second Judges case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			420. In Lochner v. New York 618 Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes famously
			<lb />
			stated (in dissent) almost a century ago:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;This case is decided upon an economic theory which a large part of the
			<lb />
			country does not entertain. If it were a question whether I agreed with that
			<lb />
			theory, I should desire to study it further and long before making up my
			<lb />
			mind. But I do not conceive that to be my duty, because I strongly believe
			<lb />
			that my agreement or disagreement has nothing to do with the right of a
			<lb />
			majority to embody their opinions in law.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			In other words, one may or may not agree with the content or wisdom of a
			<lb />
			legislation, but that has nothing to do with the correctness or otherwise of the
			<lb />
			majority decision taken by a Legislature. This view has been followed in our
			<lb />
			country as well.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			421. The Courts in our country do not question the wisdom or expediency
			<lb />
			of the Legislature enacting a statute, let alone a constitutional amendment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			422. In one of the earliest cases relating to the wisdom of Parliament in
			<lb />
			enacting a law, it was contended in A.K. Gopalan v. The State of Madras 619
			<lb />
			that the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 was unconstitutional. Justice Das
			<lb />
			expressed the view that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The point to be noted, however, is that in so far as there is any limitation
			<lb />
			on the legislative power, the Court must, on a complaint being made to it,
			<lb />
			scrutinise and ascertain whether such limitation has been transgressed and
			<lb />
			if there has been any transgression the Court will courageously declare the
			<lb />
			law unconstitutional, for the Court is bound by its oath to uphold the
			<lb />
			Constitution. But outside the limitations imposed on the legislative powers
			<lb />
			our Parliament and the State Legislatures are supreme in their respective
			<lb />
			legislative fields and the Court has no authority to question the wisdom or
			<lb />
			policy of the law duly made by the appropriate legislature.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			423. The Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 and the scheme for payment of
			<lb />
			minimum bonus were under challenge in Jalan Trading Company (P) Ltd v.
			<lb />
			Mill Mazdoor Sabha Union. 620 Speaking for the Court, Justice J.C. Shah
			<lb />
			observed that the wisdom of the scheme selected by the Legislature may be
			<lb />
			open to debate but it would not be invalid merely because some fault can be
			<lb />
			found with the scheme. It was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Whether the scheme for payment of minimum bonus is the best in the
			<lb />
			circumstances, or a more equitable method could have been devised so as
			<lb />
			to avoid in certain cases undue hardship is irrelevant to the enquiry in
			<lb />
			hand. If the classification is not patently arbitrary, the Court will not rule it
			<lb />
			discriminatory merely because it involves hardship or inequality of burden.
			<lb />
			With a view to secure a particular object a scheme may be selected by the
			<lb />
			Legislature, wisdom whereof may be open to debate; it may even be
			<lb />
			demonstrated that the scheme is not the best in the circumstances and the
			<lb />
			choice of the legislature may be shown to be erroneous, but unless the
			<lb />
			enactment fails to satisfy the dual test of intelligible classification and
			<lb />
			rationality of the relation with the object of the law, it will not be subject to
			<lb />
			judicial interference under Article 14. Invalidity of legislation is not
			<lb />
			established by merely finding faults with the scheme adopted by the
			<lb />
			Legislature to achieve the purpose it has in view.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			424. In Kesavananda Bharati it was observed by Chief Justice Sikri that:
			<lb />
			&apos;It is of course for Parliament to decide whether an amendment [to the
			<lb />
			Constitution] is necessary. The Courts will not be concerned with the
			<lb />
			wisdom of the amendment.&apos; 621 The learned Chief Justice further observed:
			<lb />
			&apos;If Parliament has power to pass the impugned amendment acts, there is no
			<lb />
			doubt that I have no right to question the wisdom of the policy of
			<lb />
			Parliament.&apos; 622
			<lb />
			425. Similarly, Justice Shelat and Justice Grover held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It is not for the courts to enter into the wisdom or policy of a particular
			<lb />
			provision in a Constitution or a statute. That is for the Constitution-makers
			<lb />
			or for the Parliament or the legislature.&quot; 623
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			426. Justice A.N. Ray expressed his view in the following words: &apos;Courts
			<lb />
			are not concerned with the wisdom or policy of legislation. The Courts are
			<lb />
			equally not concerned with the wisdom and policy of amendments to the
			<lb />
			Constitution.&apos; 624
			<lb />
			427. Justice Jaganmohan Reddy expressed the same sentiments when the
			<lb />
			learned judge said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The citizen whose rights are affected, no doubt, invokes the aid of the
			<lb />
			judicial power to vindicate them, but in discharging its duty, the Courts
			<lb />
			have nothing to do with the wisdom or the policy of the Legislature.&quot; 625
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			428. On the question of the wisdom of a constitutional amendment which
			<lb />
			ostensibly improves an existing situation, Justice Khanna expressed the view
			<lb />
			that this was not justiciable. The Court cannot substitute its opinion for that
			<lb />
			of Parliament in this regard. It was held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Whether the amendment is in fact, an improvement or not, in my opinion,
			<lb />
			is not a justiciable matter, and in judging the validity of an amendment the
			<lb />
			courts would not go into the question as to whether the amendment has in
			<lb />
			effect brought about an improvement. It is for the special majority in each
			<lb />
			House of Parliament to decide as to whether it constitutes an improvement;
			<lb />
			the courts would not be substituting their own opinion for that of the
			<lb />
			Parliament in this respect. Whatever may be the personal view of a judge
			<lb />
			regarding the wisdom behind or the improving quality of an amendment,
			<lb />
			he would be only concerned with the legality of the amendment and this,
			<lb />
			in its turn, would depend upon the question as to whether the formalities
			<lb />
			prescribed in Article 368 have been complied with.&quot; 626
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			429. With reference to the Lochner dissent, Justice Khanna noted that the
			<lb />
			view was subsequently accepted by the US Supreme Court in Ferguson v.
			<lb />
			Skrupa 627 in the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;In the face of our abandonment of the use of the &apos;vague contours&apos; of the
			<lb />
			Due Process clause to nullify laws which a majority of the Court believed
			<lb />
			to be economically unwise, reliance on Adams v. Tanner 628 is as mistaken
			<lb />
			as would be adherence to Adkins v. Children&apos;s Hospital 629 overruled by
			<lb />
			West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish 630 …..…. We refuse to sit as a &apos;super
			<lb />
			legislature to weigh the wisdom of legislation&apos;, and we emphatically refuse
			<lb />
			to go back to the time when courts used the Due Process clause &apos;to strike
			<lb />
			down State laws, regulatory of business and industrial conditions, because
			<lb />
			they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular
			<lb />
			school of thought&apos;.&quot; 631
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			430. Justice Khanna reiterated his views in Indira Nehru Gandhi wherein
			<lb />
			the learned judge held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Before dealing with the question as to whether the impugned amendment
			<lb />
			affects the basic structure of the Constitution, I may make it clear that this
			<lb />
			Court is not concerned with the wisdom behind or the propriety of the
			<lb />
			impugned constitutional amendment. These are matters essentially for
			<lb />
			those who are vested with the authority to make the constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment. All that this Court is concerned with is the constitutional
			<lb />
			validity of the impugned amendment.&quot; 632
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			431. Justice Chandrachud also expressed the same view, that is to say:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The subject-matter of constitutional amendments is a question of high
			<lb />
			policy and courts are concerned with the interpretation of laws, not with
			<lb />
			the wisdom of the policy underlying them.&quot; 633
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			432. A similar view was expressed in Karnataka Bank Ltd. v. State of
			<lb />
			Andhra Pradesh 634 wherein it was specifically observed by this Court that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;In pronouncing on the constitutional validity of a statute, the court is not
			<lb />
			concerned with the wisdom or unwisdom, the justice or injustice of the
			<lb />
			law. If that which is passed into law is within the scope of the power
			<lb />
			conferred on a legislature and violates no restrictions on that power, the
			<lb />
			law must be upheld whatever a court may think of it.&quot; 635
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			433. In view of the judicial pronouncements, there is absolutely no
			<lb />
			difficulty in accepting this proposition canvassed by the learned
			<lb />
			Attorney-General. The constitutional validity of the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act has to be tested on its own merit. The question of any Court
			<lb />
			substituting its opinion for that of the Legislature simply cannot and does not
			<lb />
			arise. A judge may have a view one way or the other on the collegium system
			<lb />
			of appointment of judges and on the manner of its implementation -but that
			<lb />
			opinion cannot colour the application and interpretation of the law or the
			<lb />
			reasoning that a judge is expected to adopt in coming to a conclusion
			<lb />
			whether the substitute introduced by the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act is
			<lb />
			constitutionally valid or not. Similarly, a judge may have an opinion about
			<lb />
			the National Judicial Appointments Commission -but again that view
			<lb />
			cannot replace a judicial interpretation of the 99 th Constitution Amendment
			<lb />
			Act or the NJAC Act.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			434. The collegium system of appointment of judges has undoubtedly been
			<lb />
			the subject of criticism. In fact, Mr. Fali Nariman who led the submissions
			<lb />
			on behalf of the Advocates on Record Association was quite critical of the
			<lb />
			collegium system of appointments. Some of the learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			respondents went overboard in their criticism. But personal opinions do not
			<lb />
			matter. Lord Templeman of the House of Lords was of the view that the
			<lb />
			collegium system of appointments is best suited to ensure the independence
			<lb />
			of the judiciary -but there are other eminent persons who are critical of the
			<lb />
			Second Judges case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			435. In the final analysis, therefore, the Courts must defer to the wisdom of
			<lb />
			the Legislature and accept their views, as long as they are within the
			<lb />
			parameters of the law, nothing more and nothing less. The constitutional
			<lb />
			validity of the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act cannot be tested on
			<lb />
			opinions, however strong they may be or however vividly expressed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(e) Needs of the people
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			436. It was also submitted by the learned Attorney-General that Parliament
			<lb />
			is aware of the needs of the people and the people want a change from the
			<lb />
			collegium system of appointment of judges. Parliament has responded to this
			<lb />
			demand and this Court should not reject this demand only because it believes
			<lb />
			that the collegium system is working well and that the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act introduces a different system which reduces the role of the
			<lb />
			judiciary in making appointments by taking away its primacy in this regard.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			437. Apart from the presumption that an enactment is constitutionally valid,
			<lb />
			there is also a presumption that the Legislature understands and correctly
			<lb />
			appreciates the needs of the people. This was observed in Charanjit Lal
			<lb />
			Chowdhuri and reliance was placed on the following passage from
			<lb />
			Middleton v. Texas Power and Light Co. 636 :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It must be presumed that a legislature understands and correctly
			<lb />
			appreciates the need of its own people, that its laws are directed to
			<lb />
			problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are
			<lb />
			based upon adequate grounds.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			438. Similarly, in Ram Krishna Dalmia the presumption that the
			<lb />
			Legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of the people
			<lb />
			was reiterated.
			<lb />

		<p>
			439. Finally in Mohd. Hanif Quareshi v. State of Bihar 637 this view was
			<lb />
			endorsed by Chief Justice S.R. Das speaking for this Court (though it may be
			<lb />
			mentioned that this decision was subsequently overruled on another issue) in
			<lb />
			the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The courts, it is accepted, must presume that the legislature understands
			<lb />
			and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people, that its laws are
			<lb />
			directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its
			<lb />
			discriminations are based on adequate grounds.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			440. It was observed (on an issue relating to the constitutionality of the
			<lb />
			death penalty) in Makwanyane 638 as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Public opinion may have some relevance to the enquiry, but in itself, it is
			<lb />
			no substitute for the duty vested in the Courts to interpret the Constitution
			<lb />
			and to uphold its provisions without fear or favour. If public opinion were
			<lb />
			to be decisive there would be no need for constitutional adjudication. The
			<lb />
			protection of rights could then be left to Parliament, which has a mandate
			<lb />
			from the public, and is answerable to the public for the way its mandate is
			<lb />
			exercised, but this would be a return to parliamentary sovereignty, and a
			<lb />
			retreat from the new legal order established by the 1993 Constitution…….
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			This Court cannot allow itself to be diverted from its duty to act as an
			<lb />
			independent arbiter of the Constitution by making choices on the basis that
			<lb />
			they will find favour with the public. Justice Powell&apos;s comment in his
			<lb />
			dissent in Furman v Georgia bears repetition:
			<lb />
			...the weight of the evidence indicates that the public generally has
			<lb />
			not accepted either the morality or the social merit of the views so
			<lb />
			passionately advocated by the articulate spokesmen for abolition.
			<lb />
			But however one may assess amorphous ebb and flow of public
			<lb />
			opinion generally on this volatile issue, this type of inquiry lies at
			<lb />
			the periphery -not the core -of the judicial process in
			<lb />
			constitutional cases. The assessment of popular opinion is
			<lb />
			essentially a legislative, and not a judicial, function. 639
			<lb />
			So too does the comment of Justice Jackson in West Virginia State Board
			<lb />
			of Education v Barnette:
			<lb />
			The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain
			<lb />
			subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place
			<lb />
			them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish
			<lb />
			them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. One&apos;s right to
			<lb />
			life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of
			<lb />
			worship and assembly and other fundamental rights may not be
			<lb />
			submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections. 640
			<lb />
			To put it differently: &apos;The legitimacy of the Judicial Branch ultimately
			<lb />
			depends on its reputation for impartiality and nonpartisanship.&apos; 641 Public
			<lb />
			opinion, manifested through Parliament or otherwise, really pales into
			<lb />
			insignificance over the law that is interpreted impartially and in a
			<lb />
			non-partisan manner.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			441. It must be appreciated that the debate cannot be reduced to the
			<lb />
			acceptance of an unconstitutional but popular decision versus a constitutional
			<lb />
			but unpopular decision. All of us are bound by the Constitution and judges
			<lb />
			have to abide by the oath of office to uphold the Constitution and the laws,
			<lb />
			even if the decision is unpopular or unacceptable to Parliament. This is the
			<lb />
			essence of judicial review otherwise no law passed by Parliament (obviously
			<lb />
			having a popular mandate) could be struck down as unconstitutional.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(f) Passage of time
			<lb />
			442. Finally, it was submitted by the learned Attorney-General that the
			<lb />
			passage of time over the last over sixty years has shown that the system of
			<lb />
			appointment of judges that was originally operational (in which the
			<lb />
			executive has the &apos;ultimate power&apos;) and the collegium system (in which the
			<lb />
			judiciary had shared responsibility) had both yielded some negative results.
			<lb />
			It was submitted that millions of cases are pending, persons who should have
			<lb />
			been appointed as judges were not recommended for appointment and
			<lb />
			persons who did not deserve to be judges were not only appointed but were
			<lb />
			brought to this Court. The 99 th Constitution Amendment Act seeks to correct
			<lb />
			the imbalances created over a period of time and since constitutional
			<lb />
			experiments are permissible, the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act should be
			<lb />
			allowed to pass muster.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			443. There is no doubt that with the passage of time changes take place in
			<lb />
			society and in the development of the law. In fact, the only constant is
			<lb />
			change. In State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar 642 it was
			<lb />
			acknowledged by Justice Mehr Chand Mahajan that good faith and
			<lb />
			knowledge of existing conditions on the part of the Legislature has to be
			<lb />
			presumed. Appreciating this, it was later observed in Ram Krishna Dalmia
			<lb />
			that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;In order to sustain the presumption of constitutionality the court may take
			<lb />
			into consideration matters of common knowledge, matters of common
			<lb />
			report, the history of the times and may assume every state of facts which
			<lb />
			can be conceived existing at the time of legislation.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			444. In Kesavananda Bharati Justice Hegde and Justice Mukherjea
			<lb />
			observed that: &apos;The society grows, its requirements change.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			Constitution and the laws may have to be changed to suit those needs. No
			<lb />
			single generation can bind the course of the generation to come.&apos; 643
			<lb />
			445. Justice Khanna expressed the view (and this was relied on by the
			<lb />
			learned Attorney-General) that the Constitution is also intended for the future
			<lb />
			and must contain ample provision for experiment and trial. This is what
			<lb />
			Justice Khanna said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It has also to be borne in mind that a Constitution is not a gate but a road.
			<lb />
			Beneath the drafting of a Constitution is the awareness that things do not
			<lb />
			stand still but move on, that life of a progressive nation, as of an
			<lb />
			individual, is not static and stagnant but dynamic and dashful. A
			<lb />
			Constitution must therefore contain ample provision for experiment and
			<lb />
			trial in the task of administration. A Constitution, it needs to be
			<lb />
			emphasised, is not a document for fastidious dialectics but the means of
			<lb />
			ordering the life of a people. It had its roots in the past, its continuity is
			<lb />
			reflected in the present and it is intended for the unknown future.&quot; 644
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			446. A little later on in the judgment, the learned judge cited Abrams v.
			<lb />
			United States 645 and quoting Justice Holmes said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The Constitution of a nation is the outward and visible manifestation of
			<lb />
			the life of the people and it must respond to the deep pulsation for change
			<lb />
			within. &quot;A Constitution is an experiment as all life is an experiment.&quot; If the
			<lb />
			experiment fails, there must be provision for making another.&quot; 646
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			447. Fortunately for the people of the country, the independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary is not a &apos;task of administration&apos; nor is the Constitution of India a
			<lb />
			failed experiment nor is there any need for &apos;making provision for another&apos;. If
			<lb />
			the basic structure of the Constitution is to be changed, through
			<lb />
			experimentation or otherwise, then its overthrow is necessary. It is not a
			<lb />
			simple document that can be experimented with or changed through a cut
			<lb />
			and paste method. Even though the independence of the judiciary is a basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution and being a pillar of democracy it can be
			<lb />
			experimented with, but only if it is possible without altering the basic
			<lb />
			structure. The independence of the judiciary is a concept developed over
			<lb />
			centuries to benefit the people against arbitrary exercise of power. If during
			<lb />
			experimentation, the independence of the judiciary is lost, it is gone forever
			<lb />
			and cannot be regained by simply concluding that the loss of independence is
			<lb />
			a failed experiment. The independence of the judiciary is not physical but
			<lb />
			metaphysical. The independence of the judiciary is not like plasticine that it
			<lb />
			can be moulded any which way.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			448. This is not to say that the Constitution must recognize only physical
			<lb />
			changes with the passage of time -certainly not. New thoughts and ideas
			<lb />
			are generated with the passage of time and a line of thinking that was
			<lb />
			acceptable a few decades ago may not be acceptable today and what is
			<lb />
			acceptable today may not be acceptable a decade hence. But basic concepts
			<lb />
			like democracy, secularism, Rule of Law, independence of the judiciary, all
			<lb />
			of which are constituents of the basic structure of our Constitution are
			<lb />
			immutable as concepts, though nuances may change. A failed experiment of
			<lb />
			these basic concepts would lead to disastrous consequences. It is not possible
			<lb />
			as an experiment to try out a monarchy or a dictatorship or to convert India
			<lb />
			into a religious State for about ten or fifteen years and see how the
			<lb />
			experiment works. Nor is it possible to suspend the Rule of Law or take
			<lb />
			away the independence of the judiciary for about ten or fifteen years and see
			<lb />
			how the experiment works. These concepts are far too precious for
			<lb />
			experimentation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			449. Yes, the Constitution has to be interpreted as a living organic
			<lb />
			document for years and years to come, but within accepted parameters. It
			<lb />
			was said by Chief Justice Dickson of the Canadian Supreme Court in The
			<lb />
			Queen v. Beauregard 647 :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The Canadian Constitution is not locked forever in a 119-year old casket. It
			<lb />
			lives and breathes and is capable of growing to keep pace with the growth of
			<lb />
			the country and its people. Accordingly, if the Constitution can
			<lb />
			accommodate, as it has, many subjects unknown in 1867--airplanes, nuclear
			<lb />
			energy, hydroelectric power --it is surely not straining section 100 too much
			<lb />
			to say that the word &apos;pensions&apos;, admittedly understood in one sense in 1867,
			<lb />
			can today support federal legislation based on a different understanding of
			<lb />
			&apos;pensions&apos;.&quot; 648
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			450. It is this that Justice Khanna possibly had in mind when the learned
			<lb />
			judge spoke of the &apos;unknown future&apos;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Challenge to a statute and the package deal
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			451. The learned Attorney-General also adverted to the legal bases for
			<lb />
			challenging a statute. This was necessary since he desired to segregate the
			<lb />
			challenge to the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act. In
			<lb />
			principle, the segregation would be justified, but as far as this case is
			<lb />
			concerned, the learned Attorney-General had argued that the 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act were a &apos;package deal&apos; and in
			<lb />
			this he is correct. Both were discussed and debated in both Houses of
			<lb />
			Parliament almost at the same time, both were sent to the President for assent
			<lb />
			at the same time and were in fact assented to at the same time and finally
			<lb />
			both were notified at the same time. The only difference was that while the
			<lb />
			99 th Constitution Amendment Act had to undergo the ratification process, the
			<lb />
			NJAC Act did not. It was therefore a &apos;package deal&apos; presented to the country
			<lb />
			in which the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act were so
			<lb />
			interlinked that one could not operate without reference to the other. In fact,
			<lb />
			Mr. Nariman submitted that the NJAC Act should also have undergone the
			<lb />
			ratification process, but he was unable to support his argument with any law,
			<lb />
			judicial precedent, convention or practice. This question is left open for
			<lb />
			greater discussion at an appropriate stage should the occasion arise.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			452. Be that as it may, in the context of a challenge to a statute, it was
			<lb />
			submitted by the learned Attorney-General that the principles for such a
			<lb />
			challenge are quite different from a challenge to a constitutional amendment.
			<lb />
			He is right in this submission.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			453. The accepted view is that a Parliamentary statute can be struck down
			<lb />
			only if it is beyond legislative competence or violates Art.13 or the
			<lb />
			fundamental rights. The basic structure doctrine is not available for striking
			<lb />
			down a statute. It was held in State of A.P. v. McDowell &amp; Co 649 that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The power of Parliament or for that matter, the State Legislatures is
			<lb />
			restricted in two ways. A law made by Parliament or the legislature can be
			<lb />
			struck down by courts on two grounds and two grounds alone, viz., (1)
			<lb />
			lack of legislative competence and (2) violation of any of the fundamental
			<lb />
			rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution or of any other
			<lb />
			constitutional provision. There is no third ground.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			454. This view was followed in Public Services Tribunal Bar Assn v. State
			<lb />
			of U.P. 650 in the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The constitutional validity of an Act can be challenged only on two
			<lb />
			grounds viz. (i) lack of legislative competence; and (ii) violation of any of
			<lb />
			the fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution or of any
			<lb />
			other constitutional provisions. In State of A.P. v. McDowell &amp; Co this
			<lb />
			Court has opined that except the above two grounds there is no third
			<lb />
			ground on the basis of which the law made by the competent legislature
			<lb />
			can be invalidated and that the ground of invalidation must necessarily fall
			<lb />
			within the four corners of the aforementioned two grounds.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			455. Earlier, this Court had taken a much broader view of the issue of a
			<lb />
			challenge to a statute in Chhotabhai Jethabhai Patel v. Union of India. 651 It
			<lb />
			was held therein that apart from the question of legislative competence and
			<lb />
			violation of Article 13 of the Constitution, a statute could be challenged if its
			<lb />
			enactment was prohibited by a provision of the Constitution. It was held as
			<lb />
			follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;If by reason of Article 265 every tax has to be imposed by &quot;law&quot; it would
			<lb />
			appear to follow that it could only be imposed by a law which is valid by
			<lb />
			conformity to the criteria laid down in the relevant Articles of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. These are that the law should be (1) within the legislative
			<lb />
			competence of the legislature being covered by the legislative entries in
			<lb />
			Schedule VII of the Constitution; (2) the law should not be prohibited by
			<lb />
			any particular provision of the Constitution such as for example, Articles
			<lb />
			276(2), 286 etc., and (3) the law or the relevant portion thereof should not
			<lb />
			be invalid under Article 13 for repugnancy to those freedom which are
			<lb />
			guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution which are relevant to the
			<lb />
			subject-matter of the law.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			456. This view was taken forward in Kihoto Hollohan v. Zachillhu 652
			<lb />
			wherein it was held that the procedure for enacting a &apos;law&apos; should be
			<lb />
			followed. Although it is not expressly stated, but it appears that if the
			<lb />
			procedure is not followed then the &apos;law&apos; to that extent will have no effect. In
			<lb />
			this case, it was held that Paragraph 7 of the Tenth Schedule to the
			<lb />
			Constitution needed ratification in terms of clause (b) of the proviso to
			<lb />
			Article 368(2) of the Constitution. It was held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;That having regard to the background and evolution of the principles
			<lb />
			underlying the Constitution (Fifty-second Amendment) Act, 1985, insofar
			<lb />
			as it seeks to introduce the Tenth Schedule in the Constitution of India, the
			<lb />
			provisions of Paragraph 7 of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution in
			<lb />
			terms and in effect bring about a change in the operation and effect of
			<lb />
			Articles 136, 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India and, therefore, the
			<lb />
			amendment would require to be ratified in accordance with the proviso to
			<lb />
			sub-article (2) of Article 368 of the Constitution of India.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			457. Strictly speaking, therefore, an amendment to the Constitution can be
			<lb />
			challenged only if it alters the basic structure of the Constitution and a law
			<lb />
			can be challenged if: (1) It is beyond the competence of the Legislature; (2)
			<lb />
			It violates Article 13 of the Constitution; (3) It is enacted contrary to a
			<lb />
			prohibition in the Constitution; and (4) It is enacted without following the
			<lb />
			procedure laid down in the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			458. At the same time, it has been emphasized by this Court that the
			<lb />
			possibility of abuse of a provision of a statute is not a ground for striking it
			<lb />
			down. An abuse of power can always be checked through judicial review of
			<lb />
			the action complained of. In D.K. Trivedi &amp; Sons v. State of Gujarat 653 it
			<lb />
			was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Where a statute confers discretionary powers upon the executive or an
			<lb />
			administrative authority, the validity or constitutionality of such power
			<lb />
			cannot be judged on the assumption that the executive or such authority
			<lb />
			will act in an arbitrary manner in the exercise of the discretion conferred
			<lb />
			upon it. If the executive or the administrative authority acts in an arbitrary
			<lb />
			manner, its action would be bad in law and liable to be struck down by the
			<lb />
			courts but the possibility of abuse of power or arbitrary exercise of power
			<lb />
			cannot invalidate the statute conferring the power or the power which has
			<lb />
			been conferred by it.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			459. Similarly, Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy (speaking for Justice J.S. Verma,
			<lb />
			Justice S.C. Agrawal, Justice A.S. Anand, Justice B.N. Kirpal and himself)
			<lb />
			held in Mafatlal Industries Ltd. v. Union of India 654 :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It is equally well-settled that mere possibility of abuse of a provision by
			<lb />
			those in charge of administering it cannot be a ground for holding the
			<lb />
			provision procedurally or substantively unreasonable. In Collector of
			<lb />
			Customs v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty, this Court observed: &quot;The
			<lb />
			possibility of abuse of a statute otherwise valid does not impart to it any
			<lb />
			element of invalidity.&quot; It was said in State of Rajasthan v. Union of India,
			<lb />
			&quot;it must be remembered that merely because power may sometimes be
			<lb />
			abused, it is no ground for denying the existence of power. The wisdom of
			<lb />
			man has not yet been able to conceive of a government with power
			<lb />
			sufficient to answer all its legitimate needs and at the same time incapable
			<lb />
			of mischief&quot;. (Also see Commr., H.R.E. v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha
			<lb />
			Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt.&quot; (Internal citations omitted)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<head>
			Article 122 of the Constitution
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			460. Before dealing with the substantive issue of the challenge before us, it
			<lb />
			may be mentioned that Mr. Fali S. Nariman contended that Parliament did
			<lb />
			not have the competence to pass the NJAC Act until the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act was brought into force or at least it had the assent of the
			<lb />
			President. It is not possible to accept this submission since the passage of
			<lb />
			the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act was
			<lb />
			contemporaneous, if not more or less simultaneous. In view of Article 122(1)
			<lb />
			of the Constitution which provides that the validity of any proceedings in
			<lb />
			Parliament shall not be called in question on the ground of any alleged
			<lb />
			irregularity of procedure, it is not possible to delve into the proceedings in
			<lb />
			Parliament.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			461. In Babulal Parate v. State of Bombay 655 this Court added, by way of
			<lb />
			a post-script, its view on Article 122(1) of the Constitution. It was observed
			<lb />
			that in a given hypothetical situation the question will not be the validity of
			<lb />
			proceedings in Parliament but the violation of a constitutional provision. It
			<lb />
			was said as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It is advisable, perhaps, to add a few more words about Art. 122(1) of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. Learned counsel for the appellant has posed before us the
			<lb />
			question as to what would be the effect of that Article if in any Bill
			<lb />
			completely unrelated to any of the matters referred to in Cls. (a) to (e) of
			<lb />
			Art. 3 an amendment was to be proposed and accepted changing (for
			<lb />
			example) the name of a State. We do not think that we need answer such a
			<lb />
			hypothetical question except merely to say that if an amendment is of such
			<lb />
			a character that it is not really an amendment and is clearly violative of
			<lb />
			Art. 3, the question then will be not the validity of proceedings in
			<lb />
			Parliament but the violation of a constitutional provision.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			462. In Raja Ram Pal v. Lok Sabha 656 the question of the extent of judicial
			<lb />
			review of parliamentary matters came up for consideration. Speaking for
			<lb />
			Justices K.G. Balakrishnan, D.K. Jain and himself, it was held by Chief
			<lb />
			Justice Sabharwal, with reference to the CAD that procedural irregularities in
			<lb />
			Parliament cannot undo or vitiate what happens within its four walls, that is,
			<lb />
			internal parliamentary proceedings. However, proceedings that are
			<lb />
			substantively illegal or unconstitutional, as opposed to irregular are not
			<lb />
			protected from judicial scrutiny by Article 122(1) of the Constitution. 657
			<lb />
			463. Insofar as the NJAC Act is concerned, nothing has been shown by way
			<lb />
			of any substantive illegality in its passage or anything unconstitutional in its
			<lb />
			passage in the sense that any provision of the Constitution or any substantive
			<lb />
			rule regulating parliamentary activity has been violated. At best, it can be
			<lb />
			argued that procedurally there was a violation but our attention was drawn to
			<lb />
			the rules of procedure and the decision taken in accordance with the rules
			<lb />
			which indicate that there was no procedural violation in the introduction of
			<lb />
			the NJAC Act and its passage. Justice Khehar has elaborately dealt with this
			<lb />
			issue in substantial detail in his draft judgment and it is not necessary to
			<lb />
			repeat what has been said.
			<lb />
			The amendments that are challenged -discussion
			<lb />
			464. Though no one has a right to be appointed a judge either of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court or a High Court, it does not mean that the President can
			<lb />
			decline to appoint a person as a judge without any rhyme or reason nor does
			<lb />
			it mean that the President can appoint any eligible person as a judge. Under
			<lb />
			the Government of India Act, 1919 and the Government of India Act, 1935
			<lb />
			the Crown had the unfettered discretion to do both or either. The Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly did not give this unfettered power to the President and, therefore,
			<lb />
			mandated consultation between the President and the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			for the appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court. There were reasons for
			<lb />
			this as mentioned above. Prior to the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act,
			<lb />
			under Article 124(2) of the Constitution, the President had the discretion to
			<lb />
			consult some other judges of the Supreme Court or the High Courts, as the
			<lb />
			President thought necessary for the purpose. The same constitutional
			<lb />
			position prevailed (mutatis mutandis) so far as the appointment of a judge of
			<lb />
			a High Court under Article 217(1) of the Constitution was concerned.
			<lb />
			Article 124(2) of the Constitution had three basic ingredients: The power of
			<lb />
			the President to appoint a judge of the Supreme Court; a mandatory
			<lb />
			requirement of consultation with the Chief Justice of India; a discretionary
			<lb />
			consultation with other judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			465. The 99 th Constitution Amendment Act has completely changed this
			<lb />
			constitutional position and has changed the role of the President in the
			<lb />
			appointment process as also substantially modified the mandatory
			<lb />
			consultation with the Chief Justice of India and substituted or replaced the
			<lb />
			entire process by a recommendation of the NJAC. The table below gives the
			<lb />
			textual changes made in Article 124(2) of the Constitution.

			466. The composition of the NJAC is provided for in Article 124A of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. Therefore, Article 124A of the Constitution and Article 124(2)
			<lb />
			are required to be read in conjunction with each other. The Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India is the Chairperson of the NJAC. The members of the NJAC are two
			<lb />
			other judges of the Supreme Court next to the Chief Justice of India, the
			<lb />
			Union Minister in charge of Law and Justice and two eminent persons to be
			<lb />
			nominated by a Committee consisting of the Prime Minister, the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India and the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, failing which
			<lb />
			the leader of the single largest Opposition Party in the Lok Sabha.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			467. The duty of the NJAC as provided for in Article 124B of the
			<lb />
			Constitution is to recommend persons for appointment as the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, judges of the Supreme Court, Chief Justices of High Courts and other
			<lb />
			judges of High Courts and to recommend the transfer of Chief Justices and
			<lb />
			other judges of a High Court from one High Court to any other High Court.
			<lb />
			The NJAC has the duty to ensure that the person recommended has ability
			<lb />
			and integrity.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			468. Article 124C of the Constitution provides that Parliament may by law
			<lb />
			regulate the procedure for the appointment of the Chief Justice of India and
			<lb />
			other judges of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice and other judges of the
			<lb />
			High Courts. The Article empowers the NJAC to lay down, by regulations,
			<lb />
			the procedure for the discharge of its functions, the manner of selection of
			<lb />
			persons for appointment and such other matters as may be considered
			<lb />
			necessary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			469. Simultaneous with the above amendments in the Constitution, the
			<lb />
			NJAC Act was passed by Parliament. The NJAC Act provides for
			<lb />
			recommending the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court as the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India &apos;if he is considered fit to hold the office&apos; and for
			<lb />
			recommending names for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			persons who are eligible to be so appointed. Interestingly, the NJAC &apos;shall
			<lb />
			not recommend a person for appointment if any two members of the
			<lb />
			Commission do not agree for such recommendation&apos; (Section 5 of the NJAC
			<lb />
			Act). A somewhat similar procedure has been provided for recommending
			<lb />
			the appointment of the Chief Justice of a High Court and a judge of a High
			<lb />
			Court (Section 6 of the NJAC Act).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			470. The President may accept the recommendation of the NJAC for the
			<lb />
			appointment of a particular person as a judge, but may also require the NJAC
			<lb />
			to reconsider its recommendation. If the NJAC affirms its earlier
			<lb />
			recommendation the President shall issue the warrant of appointment
			<lb />
			(Section 7 of the NJAC Act).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			471. The officers and employees of the NJAC shall be appointed by the
			<lb />
			Central Government in consultation with the NJAC and the convener of the
			<lb />
			NJAC shall be the Secretary to the Government of India in the Department
			<lb />
			of Law and Justice (Section 8 of the NJAC Act).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			472. The procedure for the transfer of judges from one High Court to
			<lb />
			another has been left to be determined by regulations to be framed by the
			<lb />
			NJAC (Section 9 of the Act). Similarly, the NJAC shall frame regulations
			<lb />
			with regard to the procedure for the discharge of its functions (Section 10 of
			<lb />
			the Act).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			473. The Central Government is empowered to make Rules to carry out the
			<lb />
			provisions of the NJAC Act (Section 11 thereof) and the Commission may
			<lb />
			make Rules to carry out the provisions of the NJAC Act (Section 12 thereof).
			<lb />
			The Rules and Regulations framed by the Central Government and by the
			<lb />
			NJAC shall be laid before Parliament and these may be modified if both the
			<lb />
			Houses of Parliament agree to the modification and Parliament may also
			<lb />
			provide that a Rule or Regulation shall have no effect (Section 13 thereof).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			474. The sum and substance of the controversy is this: If the establishment
			<lb />
			of the NJAC by the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act alters the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution, the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the
			<lb />
			NJAC Act must be declared unconstitutional. Since the establishment of the
			<lb />
			NJAC by Article 124A of the Constitution is integral to the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act and the NJAC Act and they are not severable and cannot
			<lb />
			stand alone, they too must be declared unconstitutional.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			475. While considering the constitutional validity of the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act and the NJAC Act it is necessary to deal with a submission
			<lb />
			made with reference to the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 (CRA) passed by
			<lb />
			the British Parliament. This is because it was referred, in the course of
			<lb />
			submissions, on more than one occasion. It was sought to be suggested that
			<lb />
			judges in the UK Supreme Court are appointed by the Judicial Appointments
			<lb />
			Commission constituted in terms of the CRA and there is nothing wrong if a
			<lb />
			somewhat similar procedure is adopted by our Parliament where judges of
			<lb />
			the High Courts and the Supreme Court are recommended by the NJAC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			476. The CRA and its working was adverted to by Jack Straw, the Lord
			<lb />
			Chancellor from 2007 to 2010. At that time the Lord Chief Justice was the
			<lb />
			head of the judiciary in the UK but the Lord Chancellor was nevertheless
			<lb />
			responsible &apos;for upholding the independence of the judiciary&apos;. In the 3 rd
			<lb />
			lecture on &apos;Judicial Appointments&apos; delivered on 4 th December, 2012 of the
			<lb />
			64 th series of Hamlyn Lectures titled &apos;Aspects of Law Reform -An Insider&apos;s
			<lb />
			Perspective&apos; he said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The CRA provided for the establishment of an independent Judicial
			<lb />
			Appointments Commission (JAC).
			<lb />
			The JAC was made responsible for operating the appointments process and
			<lb />
			making recommendations to the Lord Chancellor for all but the most
			<lb />
			senior appointments. For these very senior appointments (to the Court of
			<lb />
			Appeal, and the offices of Head of Division, Lord Chief Justice, and the
			<lb />
			president, deputy president and members of the UK Supreme court),
			<lb />
			separate provision was made for recommendations to be made to the Lord
			<lb />
			Chancellor by specially constituted selection panels.
			<lb />
			For each appointment, the JAC, or the specially constituted selection
			<lb />
			panel,
			<lb />
			was required to make one recommendation to the Lord Chancellor.&quot; 658
			<lb />
			&quot;In practice, as I found out through painful experience, there were a
			<lb />
			number of problems with this set-up.&quot;
		</item>
		<p>
			659
			<lb />
			&quot;I accept that the role of the Lord Chancellor in relation to High Court and
			<lb />
			Court of Appeal appointments should be limited. But for the two groups
			<lb />
			of our most senior judges, and for different reasons, in my view the Lord
			<lb />
			Chancellor should have a greater role than is provided for by the
			<lb />
			Constitutional Reform Act, or than is likely to be provided for by the
			<lb />
			current Crime and Courts Bill.
			<lb />
			The two groups of judges I am talking about are, first, the most senior
			<lb />
			members of the Court of Appeal -that is, the Heads of Division and Lord
			<lb />
			Chief Justice-and, second, the members of the UK Supreme Court. The
			<lb />
			conclusion is the same, but the arguments are different.&quot; 660
			<lb />
			The &apos;specially constituted selection panel&apos; for the appointment of judges of
			<lb />
			the UK Supreme Court (for example) is provided for in Section 26(5) of the
			<lb />
			CRA read with Schedule 8 thereof and the selection panel consists of (a) the
			<lb />
			President of the Supreme Court, (b) the Deputy President of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court, (c) one member each of (i) the Judicial Appointments Commission,
			<lb />
			(ii) the Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland, (iii) the Northern Ireland
			<lb />
			Judicial Appointments Commission. At least one member in category (c)
			<lb />
			must be &apos;non-legally qualified&apos;. With this sort of a composition of the
			<lb />
			&apos;specially constituted selection panel&apos; Jack Straw could not go against the
			<lb />
			wishes of the judiciary in respect of one appointment, as obliquely referred
			<lb />
			to by him below:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;All of this is already recognized, in principle at least, by the
			<lb />
			Constitutional Reform Act, which provides that these two groups of very
			<lb />
			senior appointments should not be made by the normal Judicial
			<lb />
			Appointments Commission process.
			<lb />
			The reality of a connection between the senior judiciary and the executive
			<lb />
			is also recognized in almost every other jurisdiction. By far the most usual
			<lb />
			approach elsewhere in the world, including in well-functioning
			<lb />
			common-law jurisdictions, is for the relevant minister to be recommended
			<lb />
			three to five names, and for that minister then to be able to choose from
			<lb />
			among these nominees. In the United Kingdom we are very unusual in
			<lb />
			insisting that the minister receives one name alone. This is explicable only
			<lb />
			in the context of where we have come from: the untrammeled discretion of
			<lb />
			the Lord Chancellor until the mid 1990s, the non-statutory nature of the
			<lb />
			pre-2005 arrangements, the opaque decision-making process and the
			<lb />
			mounting criticism of it.
			<lb />
			But these literally peculiar arrangements for these very senior
			<lb />
			appointments, intended to create a partnership approach between the
			<lb />
			judiciary and the Lord Chancellor in recognition of the requirements of the
			<lb />
			offices in question, have proved to be unsatisfactory.
			<lb />
			Both the detailed wording and the expectation in practice make it very
			<lb />
			difficult for the Lord Chancellor to exercise even his limited powers to
			<lb />
			reject or request a reconsideration of a recommendation. As is a matter of
			<lb />
			record in the press, there was one occasion when, as Lord Chancellor, I
			<lb />
			sought to use these powers.
			<lb />
			Since I have always observed the confidentiality necessary for the
			<lb />
			consideration of such appointments, I am not here going into any detail. I
			<lb />
			hope, however, that it will be accepted that I would not have sought to
			<lb />
			exercise these powers unless I believed that I had good grounds within the
			<lb />
			Act for doing so I did -good grounds, as many can now see. I went to
			<lb />
			considerable lengths to ensure that my actions could not be construed,
			<lb />
			which they were not remotely, as party political. In the event, the matter
			<lb />
			was not seen through to a conclusion. Partisans to the appointment -not
			<lb />
			anyone directly involved in the process -leaked extensive detail to the
			<lb />
			press, an election was looming; I confirmed the appointment.&quot; 661
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			477. Adverting to this lecture and the actual working of the CRA, it is said
			<lb />
			that for making senior level judicial appointments, it is &apos;impossible for the
			<lb />
			Lord Chancellor to against the wishes of the judiciary&apos;. In a recent article
			<lb />
			published in Public Law it is said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Judicial appointments are the next biggest change, responsibility for
			<lb />
			which has shifted from the executive in the form of the Lord Chancellor, to
			<lb />
			the judiciary. Formally the process is managed by the independent Judicial
			<lb />
			Appointments Commission (JAC), but in practice the process is heavily
			<lb />
			influenced by the judiciary at every stage. The Lord Chief Justice is
			<lb />
			consulted at the start of each competition. Judges prepare case studies and
			<lb />
			qualifying tests. Judges write references. A judge sits on the panels that
			<lb />
			interview candidates; and judges are consulted in statutory consultation.
			<lb />
			On the JAC, 7 of the 15 commissioners are judges. Once the JAC has
			<lb />
			completed its selection, at lower levels (Circuit judges and below) all
			<lb />
			judicial appointments are now formally made by the Lord Chief Justice,
			<lb />
			and tribunal appointments are made by the Senior President of Tribunals.
			<lb />
			The Lord Chief Justice and SPT are now responsible for 97 per cent of all
			<lb />
			judicial appointments. At more senior levels appointments are still
			<lb />
			formally decided by the Lord Chancellor; but in practice it has proved
			<lb />
			impossible for the Lord Chancellor to go against the wishes of the
			<lb />
			judiciary.&quot; 662
			<lb />
			So much for the appointment process in the UK and the &apos;judges appointing
			<lb />
			judges&apos; criticism in India!
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			478. It is not possible for any one of us to comment (one way or another) on
			<lb />
			the CRA except to say that it is not advisable to rely on values of judicial
			<lb />
			independence and conventions and systems of the appointment of judges in
			<lb />
			other countries without a full understanding of their problems and issues. We
			<lb />
			ought to better understand the situation in our country (and the decisions
			<lb />
			rendered by this Court) and how best to protect and preserve judicial
			<lb />
			independence in the circumstances that exist in our country and not have
			<lb />
			grand illusions of the systems in place in other countries.
			<lb />
			Validity of Articles 124A and 124(2) of the Constitution -the package
			<lb />
			deal
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			479. The submission of the learned Attorney-General (as mentioned above)
			<lb />
			is that the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act are a
			<lb />
			&apos;package deal&apos; and one cannot be appreciated without the other. The
			<lb />
			discussion will be in the light of this submission.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			480. At the outset, it is important to note that the package is incomplete.
			<lb />
			The 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act raise a series of
			<lb />
			unanswered questions. For example, how is the NJAC expected to perform
			<lb />
			its duties? Will there be any transparency in the working of the NJAC and if
			<lb />
			so to what extent? Will privacy concerns of the &apos;candidates&apos; be taken care of?
			<lb />
			Will issues of accountability of the NJAC be addressed? The learned
			<lb />
			Attorney-General submitted that a large number of hypothetical issues and
			<lb />
			questions have been raised not only by the petitioners but also by the Bench
			<lb />
			and it is not possible to answer all of them in the absence of a composite law
			<lb />
			and regulations being framed in accordance with the postulates of the 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act. This submission of the learned
			<lb />
			Attorney-General cannot be appreciated particularly in view of his
			<lb />
			contention, raised on more than one occasion, that what is enacted by the 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act is a package deal. Unless all eventualities are
			<lb />
			taken care of, the package deal presented to the country is an empty package
			<lb />
			with the wrapping paper in the form of the NJAC Act and a ribbon in the
			<lb />
			form of the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act. If it is not possible to answer
			<lb />
			all the questions in the absence of a composite law, rules and regulations,
			<lb />
			what was the hurry in bringing the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the
			<lb />
			NJAC Act into force as a half-baked measure?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			481. It is true that the Constitution cannot specify and incorporate each and
			<lb />
			every detail, particularly procedural details. 663 But the same time, the
			<lb />
			substantive requirements of the NJAC scheme must be apparent from the
			<lb />
			99 th Constitution Amendment Act read with the NJAC Act, particularly when
			<lb />
			it seeks to overthrow an existing method of appointment of judges that
			<lb />
			maintains the independence of the judiciary. Vital issues cannot be left to be
			<lb />
			sorted out at a later date through supplementary legislation or supplementary
			<lb />
			subordinate legislation, otherwise an unwholesome hiatus would be created,
			<lb />
			making matters worse.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			482. The package deal must survive as whole or fall as a whole -there
			<lb />
			cannot be piecemeal existence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			483. Viewed in this light, the constitutional validity of Article 124(2) read
			<lb />
			with Article 124A of the Constitution as introduced by the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act is suspect for several reasons.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) The NJAC and the role of the President
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			484. Article 124(2) of the Constitution requires the NJAC constituted under
			<lb />
			Article 124A thereof to make a recommendation to the President for the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court or a High Court. Mr. Fali S.
			<lb />
			Nariman pointed out that as far as the NJAC is concerned, it is not clear
			<lb />
			whether the President means the President acting in his/her individual
			<lb />
			capacity or the Council of Ministers. The President certainly cannot mean
			<lb />
			the individual otherwise the procedure for appointment of judges postulated
			<lb />
			by the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act would be
			<lb />
			creating an Imperium in Imperio which the Constituent Assembly
			<lb />
			deliberately avoided. On the other hand, if the President means the Council
			<lb />
			of Ministers, then on what basis can the Council of Ministers/President ask
			<lb />
			the NJAC (under the proviso to Section 7 of the NJAC Act) to reconsider its
			<lb />
			view? The Council of Ministers/President is already represented as a &apos;voting
			<lb />
			member&apos; in the NJAC through the Law Minister. Can the President/Council
			<lb />
			of Ministers/Prime Minister ask for reconsideration of a recommendation
			<lb />
			made by the NJAC to which the Law Minister (a member of the Cabinet) is a
			<lb />
			party? Would this be permissible particularly since the Law Minister
			<lb />
			represents the Union Government/President in the NJAC and would it not go
			<lb />
			against the well established principle of Cabinet responsibility?
			<lb />
			Alternatively, would it not undermine the authority of the Law Minister if in
			<lb />
			a given case the Law Ministers agrees to an appointment but the Council of
			<lb />
			Ministers does not accept it? More importantly, is the Council of
			<lb />
			Ministers/President an oversight body as far as the NJAC is concerned?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			485. Assuming (despite the above doubts) that the Council of
			<lb />
			Ministers/President requires the NJAC to reconsider its recommendation and
			<lb />
			on reconsideration the NJAC reiterates its recommendation, the President
			<lb />
			will be bound thereby even if it means overruling the objections of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India. The objection to this process of appointment of judges is
			<lb />
			two-fold. Firstly, the authority that is statutorily conferred on the NJAC to
			<lb />
			bind the President by the NJAC Act is well beyond the power conferred by
			<lb />
			Article 124(2) of the Constitution or the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act.
			<lb />
			Secondly, in the event of such a reiteration, the opinion of the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India eventually counts for nothing, contrary to the intention of the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly and the constitutional conventions followed over
			<lb />
			decades. Historically, no appointment (except perhaps one) has been made
			<lb />
			without the consent of the Chief Justice of India. Is the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act intended, wittingly or unwittingly, to give a short shrift to
			<lb />
			the views of the Constituent Assembly and constitutional conventions and to
			<lb />
			sublimate the views of the Chief Justice of India? This procedure may be
			<lb />
			contrasted with the collegium system of appointment in which the President
			<lb />
			could turn down a recommendation made by the collegium if it was not
			<lb />
			unanimous. In the present dispensation, this entitlement of the President is
			<lb />
			taken away, even if the recommendation is not unanimous, and thereby the
			<lb />
			importance of the President is considerably downsized.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			486. Additionally, the decision of the President is, in one sense, made to
			<lb />
			depend upon the opinion of two members of the NJAC, who may in a given
			<lb />
			case be the two eminent persons nominated to the NJAC in terms of Article
			<lb />
			124A(1)(d) of the Constitution. These two eminent persons can actually
			<lb />
			stymie a recommendation of the NJAC for the appointment of a judge by
			<lb />
			exercising a veto conferred on each member of the NJAC by the second
			<lb />
			proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 5 of the NJAC Act, and without
			<lb />
			assigning any reason. In other words, the two eminent persons (or any two
			<lb />
			members of the NJAC) can stall the appointment of judges without reason.
			<lb />
			That this may not necessarily happen with any great frequency is not
			<lb />
			relevant -that such a situation can occur is disturbing. As a result of this
			<lb />
			provision, the responsibility of making an appointment of a judge effectively
			<lb />
			passes over, in part, from the President and the Chief Justice of India to the
			<lb />
			members of the NJAC, with a veto being conferred on any two unspecified
			<lb />
			members, without any specific justification. This is a very significant
			<lb />
			constitutional change brought about by the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act
			<lb />
			which not only impinges upon but radically alters the process of appointment
			<lb />
			of judges, by shifting the balance from the President and the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India to the NJAC. To make matters worse, the President cannot even seek
			<lb />
			the views of anybody (other judges or lawyers or civil society) which was
			<lb />
			permissible prior to the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and a part of
			<lb />
			Article 124(2) of the Constitution prior to its amendment. It may be recalled
			<lb />
			that Article 124(2) of the Constitution enables the President to consult judges
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court and the High Court but that entitlement is now taken
			<lb />
			away by the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act. The President, in the process,
			<lb />
			is actually reduced to a dummy.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			487. It may also be recalled that the President (as an individual) had
			<lb />
			expressed a viewpoint as reported in India Today magazine of 25 th January,
			<lb />
			1999 concerning the appointment of judges of the Supreme Court. The
			<lb />
			existence of such a possibility is now not possible since the President (as an
			<lb />
			individual) has really no role to play in the appointment process except
			<lb />
			issuing a warrant of appointment when asked to do so.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			488. The sum and substance of this discussion is that there is no clarity on
			<lb />
			the role of the President. In any event, the discretion available to the
			<lb />
			President to consult judges of the Supreme Court in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of judges is taken away; the decision of the President is subject
			<lb />
			to the opinion of two eminent persons neither of whom is constitutionally
			<lb />
			accountable; there is a doubt on the well established principle of Cabinet
			<lb />
			responsibility; a statute -the NJAC Act, not the Constitution binds the
			<lb />
			President contrary to the constitutional framework; the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act makes serious and unconstitutional inroads into Article
			<lb />
			124(2) of the Constitution, as originally framed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) Role of the Chief Justice of India and the Judiciary
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			489. The Chief Justice of India is undoubtedly the Chairperson of the
			<lb />
			NJAC. However, the participation of the Chief Justice of India as an
			<lb />
			individual and the participation of the judiciary as an institution in the NJAC
			<lb />
			is made farcical by the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act.
			<lb />
			Even though the opinion of the Chief Justice of India, a pre-eminent
			<lb />
			constitutional authority in the judiciary, regarding the suitability of a person
			<lb />
			for appointment as a judge is acceptable to a majority of members of the
			<lb />
			NJAC, it can be thumbed down by two of its other members in terms of
			<lb />
			Section 5 of the NJAC Act. These two persons might be the Law Minister
			<lb />
			(representing the President) and an eminent person or two eminent persons
			<lb />
			neither of whom represent or purport to represent the President, the other
			<lb />
			pre-eminent constitutional authority in the appointment process under Article
			<lb />
			124(2) of the Constitution prior to its amendment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			490. The 99 th Constitution Amendment Act reduces the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, despite being the head of the judiciary, to one of six in the NJAC
			<lb />
			making a recommendation to the President thereby denuding him/her of
			<lb />
			conventional, historical and legitimate constitutional significance and
			<lb />
			authority and substantially skewing the appointment process postulated by
			<lb />
			the Constituent Assembly and the Constitution. The opinion of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India had &apos;graded weight&apos; or the &apos;greatest weight&apos; prior to the 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act. But now with the passage of the 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act the Chief Justice of India is
			<lb />
			reduced to a mere voting statistic. Designating the Chief Justice of India as
			<lb />
			the Chairperson of the NJAC is certainly not a solace or a solution to
			<lb />
			downsizing the head of the Judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			491. The participation of the judiciary as an institution in the NJAC is also
			<lb />
			farcical. The 99 th Constitution Amendment Act does not postulate a &apos;veto&apos;
			<lb />
			being conferred on any person in the NJAC. But the NJAC Act effectively
			<lb />
			gives that power to all members of the NJAC despite the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act. This is evident from the provisions of the NJAC Act which
			<lb />
			enable two persons, one of them being the Law Minister to veto the
			<lb />
			unanimous opinion of the three participating judges (including the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India). Therefore, even if the Judiciary as a whole and as an
			<lb />
			institution (that is the three participating judges) is in favour of a particular
			<lb />
			appointment, that unanimous opinion can be rendered worthless by any two
			<lb />
			other members of the NJAC, one of whom may very well include the Law
			<lb />
			Minister representing the political executive and another having perhaps
			<lb />
			nothing to do with justice delivery. This is certainly not what the
			<lb />
			Constitution, as framed, postulated or intended.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			492. To get over this outlandish situation it was suggested (as an alternative
			<lb />
			argument) by Mr. K.K. Venugopal appearing for the State of Madhya
			<lb />
			Pradesh that the unanimous opinion of the three participating judges should
			<lb />
			have overriding weight, that is a veto over a veto or a &apos;tie break vote&apos;. Mr.
			<lb />
			Venugopal puts this Court in a Catch-22 situation. The alternative suggested
			<lb />
			would clearly amount to judicial overreach and the judiciary rewriting the
			<lb />
			statute. The only rational course is to interpret the law as it is and if it is
			<lb />
			constitutionally valid so be it and if it is constitutionally invalid so be it. It is
			<lb />
			not advisable or possible to rewrite the law when the language of the statute
			<lb />
			is express.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			493. As mentioned above in considerable detail, the independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary took up so much discussion time of several Committees, the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly and various other bodies and institutions. Several legal
			<lb />
			luminaries have also devoted considerable effort and given a thoughtful study
			<lb />
			to the independence of the judiciary. There was a purpose to it, namely, that
			<lb />
			the independence should not be subverted via external or internal pressures.
			<lb />
			Through the medium of the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC
			<lb />
			Act, this independence is subtly put to jeopardy. The President has virtually
			<lb />
			no role to play in the appointment of judges, the Chief Justice of India is
			<lb />
			sidelined in the process and a system that is subject to possible erosion is put
			<lb />
			in place. Justice O&apos;Connor said: &apos;Judicial independence doesn&apos;t happen all by
			<lb />
			itself….. It&apos;s tremendously hard to create, and easier than most people
			<lb />
			imagine to destroy.&apos; The 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act
			<lb />
			puts us face to face with this truism in respect of the fragile bastion.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			494. The sum and substance of this discussion is that the unanimous
			<lb />
			opinion of the Judiciary can be rejected by two eminent persons or one
			<lb />
			eminent person and the Law Minister (whose opinion is subject to the
			<lb />
			opinion of the Council of Ministers, whom he/she represents); the unanimous
			<lb />
			opinion of the judiciary as an institution, an opinion that was respected (and
			<lb />
			deservedly so) counts for virtually nothing with the passage of the 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act; the Chief Justice of India is
			<lb />
			rendered, by the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act to a mere voting statistic
			<lb />
			and one among six in the NJAC virtually stripping him/her of the
			<lb />
			constitutional responsibility of appointing judges to the superior courts and
			<lb />
			denuding him/her of the authority conferred by history, constitutional
			<lb />
			convention and the Constitution; the Chief Justice of India and the institution
			<lb />
			of the judiciary is now subject to a veto by civil society in its decisions. The
			<lb />
			entire scheme of appointment of judges postulated by the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly is made topsy-turvy by the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and
			<lb />
			the NJAC Act. If this does not alter the basic structure of the Constitution,
			<lb />
			what does?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(c) Eminent persons and the veto
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			495. The inspiration for having eminent persons in the NJAC comes from
			<lb />
			the Report of the NCRWC which made this recommendation as a part of the
			<lb />
			democratic process of selecting a judge of the Supreme Court or the High
			<lb />
			Court. Article 124A(1)(d) of the Constitution provides for two eminent
			<lb />
			persons to be nominated as members of the NJAC. The nomination is by a
			<lb />
			Committee consisting of the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of India and
			<lb />
			the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha or where there is no such
			<lb />
			Leader, then the Leader of the single largest Opposition Party in the Lok
			<lb />
			Sabha. The first proviso mandates that one of the eminent persons shall be
			<lb />
			nominated from amongst persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes, the
			<lb />
			Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, Minorities or Women.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			496. The apprehension expressed by some learned counsel appearing for
			<lb />
			the petitioners is that since no guidelines have been laid down for the
			<lb />
			nomination of the two eminent persons, there is a possibility that persons
			<lb />
			who are not really eminent may be nominated to the NJAC or that their
			<lb />
			appointment will be politically motivated. So also, acknowledged eminent
			<lb />
			persons might not be nominated to the NJAC. But then, who is an eminent
			<lb />
			person?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			497. In A.K. Roy v. Union of India 664 reference was made to the difficulty
			<lb />
			in framing precise definitions. Although the decision pertained to preventive
			<lb />
			detention and criminal law, the following observation is pertinent in the
			<lb />
			context of the present discussion:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The impossibility of framing a definition with mathematical precision
			<lb />
			cannot either justify the use of vague expressions or the total failure to
			<lb />
			frame any definition at all which can furnish, by its inclusiveness at least, a
			<lb />
			safe guideline for understanding the meaning of the expressions used by
			<lb />
			the legislature. But the point to note is that there are expressions which
			<lb />
			inherently comprehend such an infinite variety of situations that
			<lb />
			definitions, instead of lending to them a definite meaning, can only
			<lb />
			succeed either in robbing them of their intended amplitude or in making it
			<lb />
			necessary to frame further definitions of the terms defined.&quot; 665
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			498. It is also necessary to notice the view expressed in the Second Judges
			<lb />
			case by Justice Verma speaking for the majority. The learned judge was of
			<lb />
			the opinion that arbitrariness in the exercise of discretion can be minimized
			<lb />
			through a collective decision. It was observed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The rule of law envisages the area of discretion to be the minimum,
			<lb />
			requiring only the application of known principles or guidelines to ensure
			<lb />
			non-arbitrariness, but to that limited extent, discretion is a pragmatic need.
			<lb />
			Conferring discretion upon high functionaries and, whenever feasible,
			<lb />
			introducing the element of plurality by requiring a collective decision, are
			<lb />
			further checks against arbitrariness. This is how idealism and pragmatism
			<lb />
			are reconciled and integrated, to make the system workable in a
			<lb />
			satisfactory manner. Entrustment of the task of appointment of superior
			<lb />
			judges to high constitutional functionaries; the greatest significance
			<lb />
			attached to the view of the Chief Justice of India, who is best equipped to
			<lb />
			assess the true worth of the candidates for adjudging their suitability; the
			<lb />
			opinion of the Chief Justice of India being the collective opinion formed
			<lb />
			after taking into account the views of some of his colleagues; and the
			<lb />
			executive being permitted to prevent an appointment considered to be
			<lb />
			unsuitable, for strong reasons disclosed to the Chief Justice of India,
			<lb />
			provide the best method, in the constitutional scheme, to achieve the
			<lb />
			constitutional purpose without conferring absolute discretion or veto upon
			<lb />
			either the judiciary or the executive, much less in any individual, be he the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India or the Prime Minister.&quot; 666
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			499. Justice Pandian in a separate but concurring opinion held the same
			<lb />
			view and expressed it in the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It is essential and vital for the establishment of real participatory
			<lb />
			democracy that all sections and classes of people, be they backward
			<lb />
			classes or Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes or minorities or women,
			<lb />
			should be afforded equal opportunity so that the judicial administration is
			<lb />
			also participated in by the outstanding and meritorious candidates
			<lb />
			belonging to all sections of the society and not by any selective or insular
			<lb />
			group.&quot; 667
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			500. In Centre for PIL v. Union of India 668 the question related to the
			<lb />
			appointment of the Central Vigilance Commissioner and the Vigilance
			<lb />
			Commissioners under the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003. The
			<lb />
			relevant provision was to the effect that a Selection Committee consisting of
			<lb />
			the Prime Minister, the Minister of Home Affairs and the Leader of the
			<lb />
			Opposition in the Lok Sabha would make a recommendation to the President
			<lb />
			who would then appoint the Central Vigilance Commissioner or the
			<lb />
			Vigilance Commissioners, as the case may be, by warrant under his or her
			<lb />
			hand and seal. In this context, this Court held that Parliament had put its
			<lb />
			faith in a High Powered Committee and it is presumed that the High
			<lb />
			Powered Committee entrusted with wide discretion would exercise its
			<lb />
			powers in accordance with the Act objectively and in a fair and reasonable
			<lb />
			manner.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			501. It was pointed out by Mr. Arvind Datar, learned senior counsel
			<lb />
			appearing for one of the petitioners that a large number of statutes mention
			<lb />
			the presence of eminent persons in a body, including some that are subject
			<lb />
			specific. However, it was pointed out by the learned Attorney-General that in
			<lb />
			a random sampling of some of these statutes, it has been found that none of
			<lb />
			them has such a High Powered Committee as in the Central Vigilance
			<lb />
			Commission Act for nominating or recommending a person for appointment
			<lb />
			to a post.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			502. Apart from anything else, it was submitted by the learned
			<lb />
			Attorney-General that the presence of eminent persons in the NJAC would
			<lb />
			lend diversity in the composition of the &apos;selection panel&apos; and that this would
			<lb />
			necessarily reflect the views of society. Reference in this context was made
			<lb />
			to Registrar General, High Court of Madras v. R. Gandhi 669 wherein it was
			<lb />
			held as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Appointments cannot be exclusively made from any isolated group nor
			<lb />
			should it be pre-dominated by representing a narrow group. Diversity
			<lb />
			therefore in judicial appointments to pick up the best legally trained minds
			<lb />
			coupled with a qualitative personality, are the guiding factors that deserve
			<lb />
			to be observed uninfluenced by mere considerations of individual
			<lb />
			opinions. It is for this reason that collective consultative process as
			<lb />
			enunciated in the aforesaid decisions has been held to be an inbuilt
			<lb />
			mechanism against any arbitrariness.&quot; 670
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			503. Under these circumstances, there can be little objection to the
			<lb />
			participation by eminent persons as consultants in the appointment process.
			<lb />
			In fact, Justice Verma acknowledged that he had sought the views of eminent
			<lb />
			lawyers while considering recommendations for the appointment of judges.
			<lb />
			If the Committee cannot be trusted to nominate &apos;eminent&apos; persons, perhaps
			<lb />
			no other committee can. The trust placed on the Committee is not a simple or
			<lb />
			statutory trust but a constitutional trust. In this regard, it is worth recalling
			<lb />
			the words of Justice Krishna Iyer in Bhim Singhji:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The confusion between the power and its oblique exercise is an
			<lb />
			intellectual fallacy we must guard against. Fanciful possibilities, freak
			<lb />
			exercise and speculative aberrations are not realistic enough for
			<lb />
			constitutional invalidation. The legislature cannot be stultified by the
			<lb />
			suspicious improvidence or worse of the Executive.&quot; 671
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			504. It is, therefore, not advisable to be alarmist, as some learned counsel
			<lb />
			for the petitioners were, but at the same time possible abuse of power cannot
			<lb />
			be wished away, as our recent history tells us. Perhaps far better and precise
			<lb />
			legislative drafting coupled with a healthy debate is a solution, but, what is
			<lb />
			of significance is the decision-taking (as distinguished from
			<lb />
			decision-making) process of the Committee. It was pointed out in Centre
			<lb />
			for PIL that in a situation such as the present, where no procedure in the
			<lb />
			functioning of the Committee is laid out, the nomination of eminent persons
			<lb />
			will be through a majority decision of the members of the Committee. 672
			<lb />
			What this means is that the Chief Justice of India would have a subsidiary
			<lb />
			role in the nomination process if he/she is in the minority. What this also
			<lb />
			means is that an executive cum legislative influence would sneak in in the
			<lb />
			process of nomination of eminent persons. In other words, from the word
			<lb />
			&apos;go&apos; the Chief Justice of India is sidelined, directly or indirectly, in the
			<lb />
			process of appointment of judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			505. It is also not possible to accept the contention that the presence of
			<lb />
			eminent persons with a voting right in the NJAC would have no impact on
			<lb />
			the independence of the judiciary, but would be beneficial in terms of
			<lb />
			bringing about diversity. The same result could very well be achieved, as
			<lb />
			suggested by Justice Verma without altering the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, without conferring a veto on the consultants.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			506. What makes matters worse is that in the absence of a quorum or
			<lb />
			unanimity in the nomination of eminent persons, the Committee could make
			<lb />
			the nomination without consulting the Chief Justice of India. Therefore, if
			<lb />
			for some valid reason, the Chief Justice of India is unable to attend a
			<lb />
			meeting, the Committee could nominate eminent persons (perhaps believing
			<lb />
			in the concept of a committed judiciary) to the NJAC and influence its
			<lb />
			decisions to accept a committed judiciary rather than an independent
			<lb />
			judiciary. 673 It is unlikely that this would happen, but if the political executive
			<lb />
			is determined, at some point of time, to have a committed judiciary, the
			<lb />
			nomination of politically active eminent persons to the NJAC disregarding
			<lb />
			the view of the Chief Justice of India is a real possibility.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			507. Another objection raised to the &apos;eminent person&apos; category is that such
			<lb />
			a person might not have any knowledge of the requirements of the judiciary
			<lb />
			and would not be able to make any effective contribution in the selection of a
			<lb />
			judge. It was submitted that the eminent person must have some background
			<lb />
			of law and the judiciary. In principle this argument is quite attractive, but
			<lb />
			really has little substance. Several members of the Constituent Assembly had
			<lb />
			no training or background in law and yet they contributed in giving us a
			<lb />
			673 It was held in Ishwar Chandra v. Satyanarain Sinha, (1972) 3 SCC 383 in paragraph 10 of the Report:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;… where there is no rule or regulation or any other provision for fixing the quorum, the presence of the
			<lb />
			majority of the members would constitute it a valid meeting and matters considered thereat cannot be held
			<lb />
			to be invalid.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Page 845
			<lb />
			glorious Constitution. One of the finest minds that we have today -Professor
			<lb />
			Amartya Sen -has had no training or background in law and yet has given us
			<lb />
			The Idea of Justice an important contribution to jurisprudence, the idea of
			<lb />
			justice in an organizational sense (niti) and the idea of realized justice
			<lb />
			(nyaya). Therefore, it would not be correct to say that an eminent person in
			<lb />
			the NJAC (or as an outside consultant) must have some connection with the
			<lb />
			law or justice delivery. If the eminent person does have that &apos;qualification&apos; it
			<lb />
			might be useful, but it certainly need not be absolutely necessary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			508. Finally, it was argued that the requirement that one eminent person
			<lb />
			should be from a specified category as mentioned in the first proviso to
			<lb />
			Article 124A(1)(d) of the Constitution is discriminatory and serves no
			<lb />
			purpose at all. In response, the learned Attorney-General submitted that the
			<lb />
			presence of an eminent person, outside the field of law would bring about a
			<lb />
			much needed diversity in the appointment of judges. The experience in the
			<lb />
			United Kingdom, as explained by Jack Straw, does not seem to bear out this
			<lb />
			assumption. In his lecture, he stated: &apos;The assumption on diversity -naïve as
			<lb />
			it turned out -was that if we changed the process, we would change the
			<lb />
			outcome.&apos; In any event, which category should or should not be represented
			<lb />
			in the NJAC through an eminent person is essentially a matter of policy and
			<lb />
			that policy does not appear to be perverse in any manner, but does require a
			<lb />
			rethink.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			509. The real cause for unhappiness is the second proviso to Section 5(2) of
			<lb />
			the NJAC Act which effectively confers a veto on each member of the
			<lb />
			NJAC. What is objectionable about the veto (a part of the package deal
			<lb />
			referred to by the learned Attorney-General) is that it can also be exercised
			<lb />
			by two eminent persons whose participation in the appointment process was
			<lb />
			not even imagined by the Constituent Assembly. Article 124(2) of the
			<lb />
			Constitution (prior to its amendment) had only two constitutional authorities
			<lb />
			involved in the appointment process -the President and the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India. The 99 th Constitution Amendment Act has introduced a third and a
			<lb />
			previously non-constitutional &apos;authority&apos; namely an eminent person. Two
			<lb />
			eminent persons who had no role to play in the appointment process prior to
			<lb />
			the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act have suddenly assumed Kafkaesque
			<lb />
			proportions and together they can paralyze the appointment process,
			<lb />
			reducing the President and the Chief Justice of India to ciphers for reasons
			<lb />
			that might have nothing to do with the judicial potential or fitness and
			<lb />
			suitability of a person considered for appointment as a judge. That they
			<lb />
			might not do so is another matter altogether but in a constitutional issue as
			<lb />
			grave as the appointment of judges, all possibilities require to be taken into
			<lb />
			consideration since it affects the independence of the judiciary and
			<lb />
			eventually the rights, including the fundamental rights, of the people. The
			<lb />
			conferment of a veto to any member of the NJAC, eminent person or
			<lb />
			otherwise, is clearly an unconstitutional check on the authority of the
			<lb />
			President and the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			510. The sum and substance of this discussion is that in principle, there can
			<lb />
			be no objection to consultation with eminent persons from all walks of life in
			<lb />
			the matter of appointment of judges, but that these eminent persons can veto
			<lb />
			a decision that is taken unanimously or otherwise by the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India (in consultation with other judges and possibly other eminent persons)
			<lb />
			is unthinkable -it confers virtually a monarchical power on the eminent
			<lb />
			persons in the NJAC, a power without any accountability; the categories of
			<lb />
			eminent persons ought not to be limited to scheduled castes, scheduled
			<lb />
			tribes, other backward classes, minorities or women but that is a matter of
			<lb />
			policy and nothing more can be said about this, except that a rethink is
			<lb />
			necessary; there can be no guidelines for deciding who is or is not an
			<lb />
			eminent person for the purposes of nomination to the NJAC, but that the
			<lb />
			choice is left to a high powered committee is a sufficient check, provided the
			<lb />
			decision of the committee is unanimous.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(d) Law Minister
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			511. The presence of the Law Minister in the NJAC was objected to by the
			<lb />
			petitioners for several reasons. Principally, it was contended that the Union
			<lb />
			of India is the biggest litigant in the courts and to have the Law Minister as a
			<lb />
			member of the NJAC might prove detrimental to a fair selection, if not
			<lb />
			counter-productive.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			512. It is true that the Union of India is the largest litigant in the country
			<lb />
			and that was recognized in the Second Judges case. It was said by Justice
			<lb />
			Pandian as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;No one can deny that the State in the present day has become the major
			<lb />
			litigant and the superior courts particularly the Supreme Court, have
			<lb />
			become centres for turbulent controversies, some of which with a flavour
			<lb />
			of political repercussions and the Courts have to face tempest and storm
			<lb />
			because their vitality is a national imperative. In such circumstances,
			<lb />
			therefore, can the Government, namely, the major litigant be justified in
			<lb />
			enjoying absolute authority in nominating and appointing its arbitrators.
			<lb />
			The answer would be in the negative. If such a process is allowed to
			<lb />
			continue, the independence of judiciary in the long run will sink without
			<lb />
			any trace.&quot; 674
			<lb />
			513. Similarly, Justice Kuldip Singh also mentioned that the Union of India
			<lb />
			is the single largest litigant in the country. The learned judge said:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;In S.P. Gupta case this Court construed the words in Articles 124(2) and
			<lb />
			217(1) of the Constitution by taking the clock back by forty years. The
			<lb />
			functioning of the Apex Judiciary during the last four decades, the
			<lb />
			expanding horizon of, &apos;judicial review&apos;, the broader concept of
			<lb />
			&apos;independence of judiciary&apos;, practice and precedents in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of judges which ripened into conventions and the role of the
			<lb />
			executive being the largest single litigant before the courts, are some of the
			<lb />
			vital aspects which were not adverted to by this Court while interpreting
			<lb />
			the constitutional provisions.&quot; 675
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			514. The learned judge expressed the same sentiment far more
			<lb />
			emphatically in the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Then the question which comes up for consideration is, can there be an
			<lb />
			independent judiciary when the power of appointment of judges vests in
			<lb />
			the executive? To say yes, would be illogical. The independence of
			<lb />
			judiciary is inextricably linked and connected with the constitutional
			<lb />
			process of appointment of judges of the higher judiciary. &apos;Independence of
			<lb />
			Judiciary&apos; is the basic feature of our Constitution and if it means what we
			<lb />
			have discussed above, then the Framers of the Constitution could have
			<lb />
			never intended to give this power to the executive. Even otherwise the
			<lb />
			Governments -Central or the State -are parties before the Courts in large
			<lb />
			number of cases. The Union Executive have vital interests in various
			<lb />
			important matters which come for adjudication before the Apex Court. The
			<lb />
			executive -in one form or the other -is the largest single litigant before the
			<lb />
			courts. In this view of the matter the judiciary being the mediator -
			<lb />
			between the people and the executive -the Framers of the Constitution
			<lb />
			could not have left the final authority to appoint the Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court and of the High Courts in the hands of the executive. This Court in
			<lb />
			S.P. Gupta case proceeded on the assumption that the independence of
			<lb />
			judiciary is the basic feature of the Constitution but failed to appreciate
			<lb />
			that the interpretation, it gave, was not in conformity with broader facets of
			<lb />
			the two concepts -&apos;independence of judiciary&apos; and &apos;judicial review&apos; -
			<lb />
			which are interlinked.&quot; 676
			<lb />
			In view of this, there can be no doubt that the Government of India is a major
			<lb />
			litigant and for a Cabinet Minister to be participating (and having a veto) in
			<lb />
			the actual selection of a judge of a High Court or the Supreme Court is
			<lb />
			extremely anomalous. 677
			<lb />
			515. Historically, and I have quoted chapter and verse from virtually every
			<lb />
			relevant committee in this regard, the executive was always intended to be
			<lb />
			kept out of the decision-taking process in the matter of appointment of
			<lb />
			judges. What is sought to be achieved by including the Law Minister in the
			<lb />
			NJAC is to cast a doubt on the wisdom of legal luminaries, Dr. Ambedkar
			<lb />
			and the Constituent Assembly in keeping the executive out of the
			<lb />
			decision-taking process in the appointment of judges.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			516. Nevertheless, it is true that inputs from the executive are important in
			<lb />
			the process of taking a decision whether a person should or should not be
			<lb />
			appointed as a judge of a High Court or the Supreme Court. But providing
			<lb />
			inputs by the executive is quite different from the process of taking a
			<lb />
			decision by the executive or the executive being involved in the process of
			<lb />
			taking a decision. While it must be acknowledged that the Law Minister is
			<lb />
			only one of six in the NJAC but being a Cabinet Minister representing the
			<lb />
			entire Cabinet and the Government of India in the NJAC, the Law Minister
			<lb />
			is undoubtedly a very important and politically powerful figure whose views
			<lb />
			can, potentially, have a major impact on the views that other members of the
			<lb />
			NJAC may hold. Since the Law Minister is, by virtue of the office held,
			<lb />
			potentially capable of influencing the decision of a member of the NJAC, it
			<lb />
			would be inappropriate for the Law Minister to be a part of the
			<lb />
			decision-taking process. The selection process must not only be fair but must
			<lb />
			appear to be fair.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			517. It must be realized and appreciated that the tectonic shift in several
			<lb />
			countries towards constituting a judicial appointment commission is taking
			<lb />
			place only to ensure that the executive does not have a role in the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges. The learned Attorney-General supported the shift but
			<lb />
			if the trend is to be taken seriously, the Law Minister can have no place in
			<lb />
			any commission or, as in the present case, in the NJAC. Therefore, while the
			<lb />
			99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act attempt to set up a body
			<lb />
			intended to be independent of the executive, the NJAC that has been set up
			<lb />
			has an important member of the political executive as a part of this body,
			<lb />
			which is rather anachronistic.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			518. It must also be realized that as mentioned in the First Judges case two
			<lb />
			countries Australia (today having a total of about 200 judges in the High
			<lb />
			Court and the State Supreme Courts) and New Zealand (today having a total
			<lb />
			of about 20 judges [in the Supreme Court and in the Court of Appeal]) were
			<lb />
			veering round to having a judicial appointment commission for the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary. 678 We were informed during the hearing of these petitions that
			<lb />
			these countries have not, even after four decades, established such
			<lb />
			commissions, while our country seems to be in a great rush to do so. The
			<lb />
			issues, debates, discussions and considerations in these countries would be
			<lb />
			different from ours, but merely because these and other countries are looking
			<lb />
			towards a judicial appointment commission is no reason for India to do so. A
			<lb />
			reference was also made to South Africa but, as everyone knows, diversity
			<lb />
			issues in that country are of great concern post apartheid. It is, therefore,
			<lb />
			odious to compare the judicial appointment systems in other countries with
			<lb />
			our country and to lift ideas and concepts that might be workable in those
			<lb />
			countries without considering whether they could be adopted or adapted in
			<lb />
			our country.
			<lb />

		<p>
			519. In Australia, an article suggesting adoption of the UK Judicial
			<lb />
			Appointments Commission introduced by the CRA has this to say about
			<lb />
			judicial appointments and political patronage (which might be possible in the
			<lb />
			NJAC as established):
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;While the collective strength and quality of the Australian judiciary is not
			<lb />
			in doubt, it is the case that particular appointments have attracted criticism,
			<lb />
			either in relation to the character and ability of the individual chosen or
			<lb />
			their conduct while in office. It is a notorious fact that judicial officers
			<lb />
			have been appointed, including to the High Court, whose character and
			<lb />
			intellectual and legal capacities have been doubted and whose
			<lb />
			appointments have been identified as instances of political patronage.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			678 Justice Bhagwati: &quot;We may point out that even countries like Australia and New Zealand have veered
			<lb />
			round to the view that there should be a Judicial Commission for appointment of the higher judiciary. As
			<lb />
			recently as July 1977 the Chief Justice of Australia publicly stated that the time had come for such a
			<lb />
			commission to be appointed in Australia. So also in New Zealand, the Royal Commission on the Courts
			<lb />
			chaired by Mr Justice Beattle, who has now become the Governor-General of New Zealand, recommended
			<lb />
			that a Judicial Commission should consider all judicial appointments including appointments of High Court
			<lb />
			Judges.&quot; [Paragraph 31

			<lb />
			What is essential is that decisional independence be guaranteed to judicial
			<lb />
			officers. The core of judicial independence is freedom from influence in
			<lb />
			the central judicial task of adjudicating disputes about legal rights that
			<lb />
			arise between private parties, between the State and private parties, and (in
			<lb />
			a federation) between components of the State. The core is protected
			<lb />
			through institutional arrangements such as tenure, remuneration and the
			<lb />
			jurisdictional separation of powers. As we have already noted, it is
			<lb />
			inescapable that politics will have a role to play in the appointment
			<lb />
			process. However, if appointments are perceived to be made on the basis
			<lb />
			of political patronage there is a threat to (at least the appearance of)
			<lb />
			decisional independence. It is impossible -and undesirable -to remove
			<lb />
			the political entirely from the appointments process. Indeed, in our view,
			<lb />
			&apos;political&apos; considerations, in the sense of responsibility and accountability
			<lb />
			for appointments, need to be intensified rather than obscured. What an
			<lb />
			appointments model should attempt to do is attenuate the direct influence
			<lb />
			of the political branch on the appointment process and subject its
			<lb />
			involvement in the appointment process to greater transparency and
			<lb />
			accountability, while preserving all the existing constitutional
			<lb />
			arrangements for ensuring decisional independence. &quot; 679

			<lb />
			Yvonne Mokgoro, former judge of the Constitutional Court had this to say:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Thus, judicial transformation in South Africa must include a new judicial
			<lb />
			appointments procedure which is open and independent of external
			<lb />
			influence; changing the demographics of the Bench, in particular with
			<lb />
			regards to race and gender as critical aspects of shaping the form of a
			<lb />
			judiciary which serves an open and democratic society; appreciating that
			<lb />
			judicial competence and how judges manage their judicial power and
			<lb />
			independence are major aspects of enhancing access to justice and judicial
			<lb />
			accountability. Enforcing and embracing the principles and values of a
			<lb />
			fundamentally new legal order is also a critical attitudinal change that will
			<lb />
			have substantive implications for the judicial interpretation of the law and
			<lb />
			the creation of a new constitutional jurisprudence. These reforms are all no
			<lb />
			doubt necessary considerations for judicial transformation. Courts must
			<lb />
			therefore function efficiently so that judges can dispense justice to all,
			<lb />
			most competently. Fundamental to this principle is that when appointing
			<lb />
			judges consideration must be given to the need for the judiciary to reflect
			<lb />
			broadly the racial and gender composition of South Africa.

			In a society such as ours, where patriarchy is so deeply entrenched,
			<lb />
			affecting adversely the everyday lives of so many women, including
			<lb />
			women in the law, the strategic value of women&apos;s participation on the
			<lb />
			Bench and positions of power and authority should not be underestimated.
			<lb />
			Their development management style, the influence of the unique
			<lb />
			perspectives they bring to the adjudicative task and even the mere
			<lb />
			symbolism of their presence there could bring enormous returns for the
			<lb />
			transformation process itself and respect for women in society at large. The
			<lb />
			need for women both in the judiciary as a whole and in leadership
			<lb />
			positions in particular cannot be exaggerated. Although, we have come a
			<lb />
			long way, we must agree that we have just scratched the surface. We must
			<lb />
			step up our efforts. Some things must change.&quot; 680
			<lb />

			521. In a Position Paper of 11 th December, 2011 on the Appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges, the Law Society of Botswana emphasized that different legal
			<lb />
			systems require different responses in the appointment of judges. It was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Throughout the region, the relevance of judicial independence to the rule
			<lb />
			of law, democracy and the protection and promotion of human rights is
			<lb />
			undisputed. This acknowledgment notwithstanding, judicial independence
			<lb />
			continues to face threats that compromise not only individual judges but
			<lb />
			more so the institutions vested with the responsibility of dispensing justice.
			<lb />
			To that end, judicial independence remains one of the cornerstones of
			<lb />
			democracy and constitutionalism the world over, remaining the central
			<lb />
			goal of most legal systems. It has been noted that the independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary necessitates that there should be freedom from influence or
			<lb />
			control from the executive and legislative branches of the Government.
			<lb />
			To achieve this important goal, systems of appointment of judicial officers
			<lb />
			are seen as crucial to ensuring that the independence of the judiciary is
			<lb />
			achieved. Whilst there is general consensus on the importance of judicial
			<lb />
			independence, different legal systems have utilized various methods of
			<lb />
			appointing occupants of judicial office. These include; a) appointment by
			<lb />
			political institutions; b) appointment by the judiciary itself; c) appointment
			<lb />
			by a judicial council (which may include non-judge members) and
			<lb />
			sometimes d) selection through an electoral system. This diversity at the
			<lb />
			very least indicates that there exists no general consensus on the best
			<lb />
			approach to guarantee judicial independence. That notwithstanding, the
			<lb />
			mechanisms for the appointment of judges remain crucial in maintaining
			<lb />
			judicial independence and public confidence in the judiciary.&quot; 681
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			522. It was pointed out by the learned Attorney-General that at all times
			<lb />
			since Independence, the Law Minister has been a part of the process in the
			<lb />

			<lb />
			appointment of judges. In fact it is through the Law Minister that important
			<lb />
			inputs are placed before the Chief Justice of India particularly with regard to
			<lb />
			matters that the Chief Justice of India may not be aware of, such as the
			<lb />
			antecedents and personal traits of the person being considered for
			<lb />
			appointment as a judge. There is, therefore, no reason to now exclude the
			<lb />
			Law Minister from this process.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			523. There is a distinction, as mentioned above, between the Law Minister
			<lb />
			providing inputs to the Chief Justice of India and the Law Minister having a
			<lb />
			say in the final decision regarding the appointment of a judge of a High
			<lb />
			Court or the Supreme Court. While the former certainly cannot be objected
			<lb />
			to and in fact would be necessary, it is the participation in the decision-taking
			<lb />
			process that is objectionable. In other words, the Law Minister might be a
			<lb />
			part of the decision-making process (as the position was prior to the 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act) but ought not to be a part of the
			<lb />
			decision-taking process. This distinction is quite crucial. The voting
			<lb />
			participation of the Law Minister in the decision-taking process goes against
			<lb />
			the grain of the debates in the Constituent Assembly and clearly amounts to
			<lb />
			an alteration of the basic structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			524. It was faintly contended by Mr. Nariman that having only the Law
			<lb />
			Minister of the Government of India as a member of the NJAC and not
			<lb />
			having his/her counterpart from the State Government as a member of the
			<lb />
			NJAC may have an impact on federalism in our Constitution. Apart from
			<lb />
			mentioning it, no serious argument was advanced in this regard, perhaps
			<lb />
			because the principal objection is to the representation of the Government of
			<lb />
			India in the NJAC. In view of the fact that no detailed submissions were
			<lb />
			made in this regard, I would not like to express any opinion on this
			<lb />
			contention.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			525. The sum and substance of this discussion is that the struggle for the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary has always been pivoted around the exclusion
			<lb />
			of the executive in decision-taking, but the inclusion of the Law Minister in
			<lb />
			the NJAC is counter-productive, historically counter-majoritarian and goes
			<lb />
			against the grain of various views expressed in various committees -more so
			<lb />
			since the Law Minister can exercise a veto in the decision-taking body; the
			<lb />
			presence of the Law Minister in the NJAC is totally unnecessary and
			<lb />
			ill-advised; the presence of the Law Minister in the NJAC casts a doubt on
			<lb />
			the principle of Cabinet responsibility.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(e) The NJAC and the impact on mandatory consultation
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			526. Article 124(2) of the Constitution as originally framed made it
			<lb />
			mandatory for the President to consult the Chief Justice of India in the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges. The rationale behind this has already been discussed.
			<lb />
			The 99 th Constitution Amendment Act completely does away with the
			<lb />
			mandatory consultation. The President is not expected to consult anybody in
			<lb />
			the appointment process -he/she is expected to act only on the
			<lb />
			recommendation of the NJAC. The authority that the President had to turn
			<lb />
			down a recommendation made by the collegium, if it was not unanimous, is
			<lb />
			now taken away from the President who is obliged to accept a
			<lb />
			recommendation from the NJAC even if it is not unanimous. This is a
			<lb />
			considerable whittling down of the authority of the President and a drastic
			<lb />
			change in the appointment process and in a sense reduces the President (as
			<lb />
			an individual) to a rubber stamp. 682 Similarly, as mentioned above the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India is reduced to just another number in the NJAC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			527. Mandatory consultation between the President and the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India was well thought out by the Drafting Committee and the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly but has now been made farcical by the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act, for the reasons mentioned above. Article 124(2) of the
			<lb />
			Constitution (prior to its amendment) placed the President and the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India on an equal pedestal. It is this that made the consultation
			<lb />
			between these two constitutional authorities meaningful and made one
			<lb />
			constitutional authority act as a check on the other. This was the &apos;partnership
			<lb />
			approach&apos; that the Constituent Assembly had in mind and this was given
			<lb />
			flesh and blood through, what Dr. Rajeev Dhavan referred to as &apos;institutional
			<lb />
			participation&apos; in the Second Judges case. The importance of the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case lies not so much in the shared responsibility but the
			<lb />
			&apos;institutional participation&apos; of the judiciary in the appointment process
			<lb />
			integrated with the participation of the President. This is now missing.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			528. What is the importance of the mandatory consultation? There are two
			<lb />
			crucial factors to be carefully considered before a person is appointed as a
			<lb />
			judge of the Supreme Court or a High Court. These are: (1) The professional
			<lb />
			skills, judicial potential, suitability and temperament of a person to be a good
			<lb />
			judge, and (2) The personal strengths, weaknesses, habits and traits of that
			<lb />
			person. As far as the professional skills, judicial potential, suitability and
			<lb />
			temperament of a person being a good judge is concerned, the most
			<lb />
			appropriate person to make that assessment would be the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India (in consultation with the other judges) and not somebody from outside
			<lb />
			the legal fraternity. On the other hand, as far as the personal strengths,
			<lb />
			weaknesses, habits and traits of a person are concerned, appropriate inputs
			<lb />
			can come only from the executive, since the Chief Justice of India and other
			<lb />
			judges may not be aware of them. It is for this reason that the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly made it mandatory for consultation between the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India (as the head of the Judiciary) having vital inputs on the potential of a
			<lb />
			person being a good judge and the President (as the Head of State acting
			<lb />
			through the Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as the head of the
			<lb />
			Executive) being the best judge to assess the personal traits of a person being
			<lb />
			considered for appointment as a judge. In other words, the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India is the &apos;expert&apos; with regard to potential while the executive is the
			<lb />
			&apos;expert&apos; with regard to the antecedents and personal traits. Since these two
			<lb />
			facets of the personality of a would-be judge are undoubtedly distinct, there
			<lb />
			cannot be a difference of opinion between the judiciary and the executive in
			<lb />
			this regard since they both express an opinion on different facets of a
			<lb />
			person&apos;s life. The Chief Justice of India cannot comment upon the &apos;expert
			<lb />
			opinion&apos; of the executive nor can the executive comment upon the &apos;expert
			<lb />
			opinion&apos; of the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			529. It is for the Chief Justice of India as the head of the judiciary to
			<lb />
			manage the justice delivery system and it is for him/her to take the final call
			<lb />
			whether the antecedents or personal traits of a person will or will not
			<lb />
			interfere in the discharge of functions as a judge or will, in any manner,
			<lb />
			impact on the potential of becoming a good judge. As stated by Jack Straw,
			<lb />
			what is important is that it is necessary to get it right the first time and every
			<lb />
			time. There can be a situation where the personal traits of a person may be
			<lb />
			such as to disqualify that person from being appointed as a judge and there
			<lb />
			can be a situation where the personal traits, though objected to, would not
			<lb />
			have any impact whatsoever on the potential of that person becoming a good
			<lb />
			judge. For example, in the recent past, there has been considerable debate
			<lb />
			and discussion, generally but not relating to the judiciary, with regard to
			<lb />
			issues of sexual orientation. It is possible that the executive might have an
			<lb />
			objection to the sexual orientation of a person being considered for
			<lb />
			appointment as a judge but the Chief Justice of India may be of the opinion
			<lb />
			that that would have no impact on his/her ability to effectively discharge
			<lb />
			judicial functions or the potential of that person to be a good judge. 683 In
			<lb />
			situations such as this, it is the opinion of the Chief Justice of India that
			<lb />
			should have greater weight since, as mentioned earlier, it is for the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India to efficiently and effectively manage the justice delivery
			<lb />
			system and, therefore, the last word should be with the Chief Justice of India,
			<lb />
			unanimously expressed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			530. The 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act not only
			<lb />
			reduce the Chief Justice of India to a number in the NJAC but also convert
			<lb />
			the mandatory consultation between the President and the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India to a dumb charade with the NJAC acting as an intermediary. On earlier
			<lb />
			occasions, Parliament enhanced its power through constitutional
			<lb />
			amendments, which were struck down, inter alia, in Indira Nehru Gandhi
			<lb />
			and Minerva Mills. 684 The 99 th Constitution Amendment Act
			<lb />
			unconstitutionally minimizes the role of the Chief Justice of India and the
			<lb />
			judiciary to a vanishing point in the appointment of judges. It also
			<lb />
			considerably downsizes the role of the President. This effaces the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the independence of the judiciary by sufficiently altering the
			<lb />
			process of appointment of judges to the Supreme Court and the High Court,
			<lb />
			683 Australia and South Africa have had a gay judge on the Bench. The present political executive in India
			<lb />
			would perhaps not permit the appointment of a gay person to the Bench.
			<lb />
			684 In I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu, (2007) 2 SCC 1 this Court observed in paragraph 138 of the
			<lb />
			Report: &quot;The relevance of Indira Gandhi case, Minerva Mills case and Waman Rao case [(1981) 2 SCC
			<lb />
			362] lies in the fact that every improper enhancement of its own power by Parliament, be it clause (4) of
			<lb />
			Article 329-A or clauses (4) and (5) of Article 368 or Section 4 of the 42nd Amendment has been held to be
			<lb />
			incompatible with the doctrine of basic structure as they introduced new elements which altered the identity
			<lb />
			of the Constitution or deleted the existing elements from the Constitution by which the very core of the
			<lb />
			Constitution is discarded. They obliterated important elements like judicial review. They made directive
			<lb />
			principles en bloc a touchstone for obliteration of all the fundamental rights and provided for insertion of
			<lb />
			laws in the Ninth Schedule which had no nexus with agrarian reforms.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Page 860
			<lb />
			or at least alters it unconstitutionally thereby striking at the very basis of the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			531. The entire issue may be looked at in another light: Why did the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly make it mandatory for the President to consult the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India for the appointment of judges of the Supreme Court or
			<lb />
			the High Court when equally important, if not more important constitutional
			<lb />
			authorities could be appointed by the President without consulting anybody
			<lb />
			and in his/her &apos;unfettered discretion&apos;? The reason for the &apos;special&apos; treatment
			<lb />
			in the case of appointments to the judiciary is because the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly appreciated and acknowledged and, therefore, accepted the
			<lb />
			necessity of preserving and protecting the independence of the judiciary, a
			<lb />
			significant pillar of parliamentary democracy. It also acknowledged that the
			<lb />
			most appropriate person to guide and advice the President in the appointment
			<lb />
			of judges would be none other than the Chief Justice of India. It was known
			<lb />
			to the Constituent Assembly that the rights of the people, including their
			<lb />
			fundamental rights, need protection against arbitrary executive power and
			<lb />
			excessive legislative action and unless the judiciary steps in and grants that
			<lb />
			protection, such arbitrary power or excessive action can be misused and
			<lb />
			abused. This had happened in pre Independent India and has happened in our
			<lb />
			recent history. The 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act
			<lb />
			positively indicate (unconstitutionally) that now the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			and the other judges are not necessarily the best persons to advise the
			<lb />
			President on the appointment of judges.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			532. Underscoring the importance of the appointment of independent
			<lb />
			judges (to Americans, and this would equally apply to Indians) it has been
			<lb />
			said that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Judicial appointments are important because judges matter, not just to
			<lb />
			academics, politicians, and practitioners, but to all Americans. Judges play
			<lb />
			an increasingly significant role in everyday life decisions. It follows that
			<lb />
			the process by which they are selected matters. It likewise follows that
			<lb />
			because of the perceived importance of appointing judges, the
			<lb />
			appointments process breeds contention.&quot; 685
			<lb />
			533. Without an independent judiciary, not only &apos;everyday life decisions&apos;
			<lb />
			are affected but a dominant executive can ensure that the statutory rights
			<lb />
			would have no meaning and the fundamental rights of the people of the
			<lb />
			country can be easily trampled upon. Highlighting the impact of the judiciary
			<lb />
			(generally) on the Rule of Law and particularly on the rights and interests of
			<lb />
			individuals, Chief Justice Mason of Australia had this to say:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Another factor relevant to the mode of selection of judges is the
			<lb />
			judiciary&apos;s position as an important branch or institution of government.
			<lb />
			The judges exercise public power in a way that has substantial impact
			<lb />
			upon the rights and interests of individuals and upon the making of
			<lb />
			important decisions by government, government agencies and other
			<lb />
			organisations.&quot; 686
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			534. The Constituent Assembly was well aware of the misuse and abuse of
			<lb />
			power by the executive, having fought for our freedom and knew and
			<lb />
			understood the value of an independent judiciary. It is for this reason that the

			686 &apos;The Appointment and Removal of Judges&apos; by Sir Anthony Mason AC KBE, formerly Chief Justice of

			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly gave prime importance to the independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary and perhaps spent more time debating it than any other topic.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			535. In this regard, it is worth recalling the submission of Mr. Palkhivala in
			<lb />
			Kesavananda Bharati while laying the basis for the &apos;width of power&apos; test
			<lb />
			(later adopted in M. Nagaraj) that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;…the test of the true width of a power is not how probable it is that it may
			<lb />
			be exercised but what can possibly be done under it; that the abuse or
			<lb />
			misuse of power is entirely irrelevant; that the question of the extent of the
			<lb />
			power cannot be mixed up with the question of its exercise and that when
			<lb />
			the real question is as to the width of the power, expectation that it will
			<lb />
			never be used is as wholly irrelevant as an imminent danger of its use. The
			<lb />
			court does not decide what is the best and what is the worst. It merely
			<lb />
			decides what can possibly be done under a power if the words conferring it
			<lb />
			are so construed as to have an unbounded and limitless width, as claimed
			<lb />
			on behalf of the respondents.&quot; 687
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			536. Now, consider this -given the width of the power available under the
			<lb />
			99 th Constitution Amendment Act if committed judges are appointed (as was
			<lb />
			propagated at one point of time and it can get actualized after the 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act) then no one can expect impartial justice as
			<lb />
			commonly understood from a &apos;committed&apos; Supreme Court or a High Court.
			<lb />
			The Constituent Assembly wished to completely avoid this and that is why
			<lb />
			considerable importance was given to the process of appointing judges and
			<lb />
			the independence of the judiciary. &apos;Common to all forms of judicial function
			<lb />
			is independent, impartial and neutral adjudication, though there is a question
			<lb />
			as to the possibility of achieving completely neutral adjudication.&apos; 688 The 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act lead to the clear possibility
			<lb />
			of a committed judiciary being put in place. If this does not violate the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution, what does?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			537. The sum and substance of this discussion is that mandatory
			<lb />
			consultation between the President and the Chief Justice of India postulated
			<lb />
			in the Constitution is by-passed -bringing about a huge alteration in the
			<lb />
			process of appointment of judges; the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and
			<lb />
			the NJAC Act have reduced the consultation process to a farce -a
			<lb />
			meaningful participatory consultative process no longer exists; the shared
			<lb />
			responsibility between the President and the Chief Justice of India in the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges is passed on to a body well beyond the contemplation
			<lb />
			of the Constituent Assembly; the possibility of having committed judges and
			<lb />
			the consequences of having a committed judiciary, a judiciary that might not
			<lb />
			be independent is unimaginable.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(f) The NJAC and the appointment of High Court judges
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			538. As far as the appointment of a judge of a High Court is concerned, the
			<lb />
			99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act have made two
			<lb />
			extremely significant changes in the process of appointment. Firstly, the
			<lb />
			mandatory requirement for consultation with the Chief Justice of the High
			<lb />
			Court has been completely dispensed with. Article 217(1) of the Constitution
			<lb />
			as it was originally enacted made it mandatory for the President to consult
			<lb />
			the Governor of the State and the Chief Justice of the High Court in the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge of a High Court. The Chief Justice has now been left
			<lb />
			out in the cold. Secondly, the constitutional obligation and constitutional
			<lb />
			convention that has developed over the last several decades is that a
			<lb />
			recommendation for the appointment of a judge of the High Court originates
			<lb />
			from the Chief Justice of the High Court. This has now been given a go-bye
			<lb />
			by the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act. The entire
			<lb />
			initiation of the appointment process has now been overhauled.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			539. In terms of Section 6(2) of the NJAC Act, the recommendation for the
			<lb />
			appointment of a judge of a High Court cannot originate from the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of the High Court but the NJAC will seek a nomination for that
			<lb />
			purpose from the Chief Justice of the High Court. In other words, the
			<lb />
			initiative for the appointment of a judge of the High Court is wrested from
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of the High Court by the NJAC. There is a qualitative
			<lb />
			difference between the Chief Justice of a High Court nominating a person for
			<lb />
			appointment as a judge of a High Court on the initiative of the NJAC
			<lb />
			(Section 6(2) of the NJAC Act) and the Chief Justice of a High Court
			<lb />
			recommending a person for appointment as a judge of a High Court (Article
			<lb />
			217(1) of the Constitution). With such a major departure from the
			<lb />
			constitutional obligation and the constitutional convention established over
			<lb />
			the last several decades, the dispensation might encourage canvassing
			<lb />
			support for a nomination -a somewhat similar occurrence was looked down
			<lb />
			upon by the LCI in its 14 th Report.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			540. However, what is more disturbing and objectionable is that the
			<lb />
			consultation process with the Chief Justice of the High Court after a
			<lb />
			nomination is made by him/her of a person for appointment as a judge of that
			<lb />
			High Court has been done away with. The process of consultation is an
			<lb />
			integrated and participatory process but by virtue of the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act and the NJAC Act only a nomination is sought from the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of a High Court by the NJAC. Thereafter, the Chief Justice has
			<lb />
			no role to play. This is clear from Section 6(7) of the NJAC Act which
			<lb />
			mandates the NJAC to elicit in writing the views of the Governor and the
			<lb />
			Chief Minister of the State before recommending a person for appointment
			<lb />
			as a judge of the High Court, but not the views of the Chief Justice, who is
			<lb />
			reduced to a mere nominating officer, whose assigned task is over as soon as
			<lb />
			the nomination is made.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			541. The combined effect of the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and
			<lb />
			Section 6 of the NJAC Act is that the entire control over the appointment of a
			<lb />
			judge of a High Court is taken over by the NJAC and the paradigm is
			<lb />
			completely altered with the Chief Justice of a High Court downgraded from
			<lb />
			a mandatory consultant, and the originator of a recommendation for
			<lb />
			appointment as postulated by Article 217(1) of the Constitution as
			<lb />
			conventionally understood, to someone who merely makes a nomination and
			<lb />
			thereafter is not required to be consulted one way or the other with respect to
			<lb />
			the nomination made. This drastic change in the process of appointment of a
			<lb />
			judge of a High Court obviously has a very long term impact since it is
			<lb />
			ultimately from the &apos;cadre&apos; of High Court judges that most Supreme Court
			<lb />
			judges would be appointed, if the existing practice is followed. This in turn
			<lb />
			will obviously have a long term impact on the independence of the judiciary
			<lb />
			apart from completely altering the process for appointment of a judge of a
			<lb />
			High Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			542. The appointment of judges is a very serious matter and it is difficult to
			<lb />
			understate its importance. Referring to a view expressed by Shimon
			<lb />
			Shetreet 689 it is stated by Sarkar Ali Akkas of the University of Rajshahi,
			<lb />
			Bangladesh that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The appointment of judges is an important aspect of judicial
			<lb />
			independence which requires that in administering justice judges should be
			<lb />
			free from all sorts of direct or indirect interference or influences. The
			<lb />
			principle of the independence of the judiciary seeks to ensure the freedom
			<lb />
			of judges to administer justice impartially, without any fear or favour. This
			<lb />
			freedom of judges has a close relationship with judicial appointment
			<lb />
			because the appointment system has a direct bearing on the impartiality,
			<lb />
			integrity and independence of judges.&quot; 690
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			543. Essentially, the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act replaces or
			<lb />
			substitutes the collegium system of appointment of judges by the NJAC. It
			<lb />
			must be realized that a judicial appointments commission (by whatever name
			<lb />
			called) is a worldwide reaction to the executive taking over and appointing
			<lb />
			judges. No system following the Rule of Law would like to retain a system
			<lb />
			of appointment of judges where the executive plays a major role or has the
			<lb />
			last word on the subject, hence the occasional clamour for a judicial
			<lb />
			appointments commission. As the Hamlyn lecture of Jack Straw illustrates,
			<lb />
			the executive desires greater control in the appointment of judges but the
			<lb />
			judiciary eventually has the upper hand, as it should -but not so with the
			<lb />
			NJAC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			544. The decision of this Court in Kumar Padma Prasad v. Union of
			<lb />
			India 691 is an example of how wrong the executive can be in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of judges. In that case, a judicial officer was recommended for
			<lb />
			appointment as a judge of the Gauhati High Court at the instance of the
			<lb />
			Chief Minister of Mizoram. The recommendation was agreed to by the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India and the warrant of appointment of the recommended person
			<lb />
			was issued by the President but it was subsequently not given effect to since
			<lb />
			the person was found not qualified to be appointed as a judge of the High
			<lb />
			Court. Recently, the Canadian Supreme Court answered a reference made by
			<lb />
			the Governor General in Council as a result of which the appointment and
			<lb />
			swearing in of a judge of the Supreme Court was declared void ab initio
			<lb />
			since he did not possess the eligibility requirement. 692 Instances of this
			<lb />
			nature, fortunately few and far between have shaken public confidence in a
			<lb />
			system of appointment of judges where primacy is with the executive, hence
			<lb />
			the desire to shift to an efficacious alternative. While there might be a need
			<lb />
			for a more efficient or better system of appointment of judges, the NJAC is
			<lb />
			not the stairway to Heaven, particularly in view of the various gaps in its
			<lb />
			functioning, the NJAC system downgrading the President and the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India and incorporating a host of other features that severely
			<lb />
			impact on the appointment of judges and thereby on the independence of the
			<lb />
			judiciary and thereby on the basic structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			545. It was submitted by the learned Attorney-General that there is a
			<lb />
			disenchantment with the collegium system of appointment of judges and that
			<lb />
			is why it needs to be replaced or substituted and that is precisely what the
			<lb />
			99 th Constitution Amendment Act has achieved. The learned
			<lb />
			Attorney-General referred to the NJAC as the third chapter in the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges -the first chapter being one in which the executive
			<lb />
			had the &apos;ultimate power&apos; in the appointment process and the second chapter
			<lb />
			being one in which the Executive and the Judiciary have a shared
			<lb />
			responsibility with the judiciary having institutional participation. This may
			<lb />
			be so, but through the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act the NJAC takes
			<lb />
			away the responsibility not only of the executive but also the shared
			<lb />
			responsibility of the judiciary and the executive, completely decapitating the
			<lb />
			appointment system given to us by the Constituent Assembly -a system that
			<lb />
			ensures the independence of the judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			546. Working within the parameters suggested by the learned
			<lb />
			Attorney-General, namely, the presumption of constitutionality of the 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act, that the basis of the judgment in the Second
			<lb />
			Judges case has been removed, the wisdom of Parliament and the needs of
			<lb />
			the people cannot be questioned and that this Court must recognize that
			<lb />
			society and its requirements have changed with the passage of time, it is not
			<lb />
			possible to uphold the constitutional validity of the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act. The recipe drastically alters the process of appointment of
			<lb />
			judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts by taking away its
			<lb />
			essential ingredients leading to a constitutional challenge that must be
			<lb />
			accepted. 547.
			<lb />
			Taking an overall and composite view of the 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act, rather than a piecemeal
			<lb />
			discussion or a dissection of each provision, there can be little doubt that
			<lb />
			Article 124A of the Constitution (as amended) is unconstitutional. Article
			<lb />
			124A of the Constitution having been declared unconstitutional, there is
			<lb />
			nothing of substance left in Article 124B and Article 124C of the
			<lb />
			Constitution and the other provisions of the 99 th Constitution Amendment
			<lb />
			Act, which are not severable and therefore these provisions must be and are
			<lb />
			declared unconstitutional being in violation of and altering the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			548. The sum and substance of this discussion is that the process of
			<lb />
			initiating a recommendation for the appointment of a judge, generally
			<lb />
			accepted since Independence, has been radically changed, with well
			<lb />
			entrenched constitutional conventions being given short shrift; the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of the High Court has been reduced to the role of a nominating
			<lb />
			officer, whose opinion is taken only for nomination purposes but not taken as
			<lb />
			a consultant in so vital a matter as the appointment of a judge; the
			<lb />
			constitutional importance given to the Chief Justice of a High Court has been
			<lb />
			completely whittled down virtually to a vanishing point.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Convenor of the NJAC
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			549. There are some peripheral issues that need to be discussed. The
			<lb />
			involvement of the executive in the NJAC does not stop with the Law
			<lb />
			Minister being one of its
			<lb />
			members. The Secretary to the Government of India in the Department of
			<lb />
			Justice is the convenor of the NJAC in terms of Section 8(3) of the NJAC
			<lb />
			Act. The duties and responsibilities of the convenor have not been
			<lb />
			delineated in the NJAC Act and, as mentioned above, the rules and
			<lb />
			regulations under the Act have not been framed. It is therefore difficult to
			<lb />
			appreciate the functions that the convenor is expected to perform.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			550. That apart, the Secretary is an officer of the government and is not
			<lb />
			answerable to the NJAC. The Secretary is paid a salary and allowances from
			<lb />
			the government coffers. This is quite unlike officers of the High Courts or
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court who are directly answerable to their respective Chief
			<lb />
			Justice. Moreover, their salary and allowances are charged upon the
			<lb />
			Consolidated Fund of India. The &apos;independence&apos; of these officers is
			<lb />
			maintained while that of the Secretary to the Government of India in the
			<lb />
			Department of Justice is not. Moreover, the Secretary holds a transferable
			<lb />
			position and can be changed at the whims and fancies of the executive,
			<lb />
			depriving the NJAC of continuity and, in a sense, leaving it high and dry
			<lb />
			whenever it pleases the executive. This is clearly objectionable. However, to
			<lb />
			be fair to the learned Attorney-General, it was submitted that if necessary a
			<lb />
			Registrar in the Supreme Court may be appointed as the convenor, but with
			<lb />
			respect that is not at all an answer to the issue raised.
			<lb />
			Transparency
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			551. In the context of confidentiality requirements, the submission of the
			<lb />
			learned Attorney-General was that the functioning of the NJAC would be
			<lb />
			completely transparent. Justifying the need for transparency it was submitted
			<lb />
			that so far the process of appointment of judges in the collegium system has
			<lb />
			been extremely secret in the sense that no one outside the collegium or the
			<lb />
			Department of Justice is aware of the recommendations made by the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India for appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court or the High
			<lb />
			Courts. Reference was made to Renu v. District Judge 693 to contend that in
			<lb />
			the matter of appointment in all judicial institutions &apos;complete darkness in
			<lb />
			the light house has to be removed.&apos; 694
			<lb />
			552. In addition to the issue of transparency a submission was made that in
			<lb />
			the matter of appointment of judges, civil society has the right to know who
			<lb />
			is being considered for appointment. In this regard, it was held in Indian
			<lb />
			Express Newspapers v. Union of India 695 that the people have a right to
			<lb />
			know. Reliance was placed on Attorney General v. Times Newspapers
			<lb />
			Ltd. 696 where the right to know was recognized as a fundamental principle of
			<lb />
			the freedom of expression and the freedom of discussion.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			553. In State of U.P. v. Raj Narain 697 the right to know was recognized as
			<lb />
			having been derived from the concept of freedom of speech.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			554. Finally, in Reliance Petrochemicals Ltd. v. Proprietors of Indian
			<lb />
			Express Newspapers Bombay (P) Ltd. 698 it was held that the right to know is
			<lb />
			a basic right which citizens of a free country aspire in the broader horizon of
			<lb />
			the right to live in this age in our land under Article 21 of our Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			555. The balance between transparency and confidentiality is very delicate
			<lb />
			and if some sensitive information about a particular person is made public, it
			<lb />
			can have a far reaching impact on his/her reputation and dignity. The 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act have not taken note of the
			<lb />
			privacy concerns of an individual. This is important because it was
			<lb />
			submitted by the learned Attorney-General that the proceedings of the NJAC
			<lb />
			will be completely transparent and any one can have access to information
			<lb />
			that is available with the NJAC. This is a rather sweeping generalization
			<lb />
			which obviously does not take into account the privacy of a person who has
			<lb />
			been recommended for appointment, particularly as a judge of the High
			<lb />
			Court or in the first instance as a judge of the Supreme Court. The right to
			<lb />
			know is not a fundamental right but at best it is an implicit fundamental right
			<lb />
			and it is hedged in with the implicit fundamental right to privacy that all
			<lb />
			people enjoy. The balance between the two implied fundamental rights is
			<lb />
			difficult to maintain, but the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC
			<lb />
			Act do not even attempt to consider, let alone achieve that balance.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			556. It is possible to argue that information voluntarily supplied by a person
			<lb />
			who is recommended for appointment as a judge might not have a right to
			<lb />
			privacy, but at the same time, since the information is supplied in confidence,
			<lb />
			it is possible to argue that it ought not to be disclosed to third party
			<lb />
			unconcerned persons. Also, if the recommendation is not accepted by the
			<lb />
			President, does the recommended person have a right to non-disclosure of
			<lb />
			the adverse information supplied by the President? These are difficult
			<lb />
			questions to which adequate thought has not been given and merely on the
			<lb />
			basis of a right to know, the reputation of a person cannot be whitewashed in
			<lb />
			a dhobi-ghat.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Doctrine of Revival
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			557. The learned Solicitor-General submitted that when a law is amended
			<lb />
			and the amendment is declared unconstitutional, the pre-amendment law
			<lb />
			does not revive. Therefore, even if the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act is
			<lb />
			declared as altering the basic structure of the Constitution, Article 124(2) of
			<lb />
			the Constitution as it existed prior to the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act
			<lb />
			will not automatically revive and the collegium system will not resurface.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			558. An interesting discussion is to be found in this regard in West U.P.
			<lb />
			Sugar Mills Assn. v. State of U.P. 699 This Court referred to B.N. Tewari v.
			<lb />
			Union of India 700 and Firm A.T.B. Mehtab Majid &amp; Co. v. State of
			<lb />
			Madras 701 in both of which it was held that if a statutory rule substitutes a
			<lb />
			rule and the new rule is struck down or declared invalid, the substituted or
			<lb />
			old rule does not revive since it ceased to exist on its substitution. The same
			<lb />
			rationale was applied to a notification in Indian Express Newspapers (Bom)
			<lb />
			(P) Ltd. v. Union of India. 702
			<lb />
			559. However, it was further held that if a subsequent law is held to be void
			<lb />
			such as in a case where the Legislature had no competence to enact the law,
			<lb />
			then the earlier or the old law would revive. It was held:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It would have been a different case where a subsequent law which
			<lb />
			modified the earlier law was held to be void. In such a case, the earlier law
			<lb />
			shall be deemed to have never been modified or repealed and, therefore,
			<lb />
			continued to be in force. Where it is found that the legislature lacked
			<lb />
			competence to enact a law, still amends the existing law and subsequently
			<lb />
			it is found that the legislature or the authority was denuded of the power to
			<lb />
			amend the existing law, in such a case the old law would revive and
			<lb />
			continue.&quot; 703
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			560. In State of T.N. v. K. Shyam Sunder 704 the two extant views on the
			<lb />
			subject have been noted. In paragraph 56 of the Report, it is pointed out that
			<lb />
			on the repeal of a statute it is effectively obliterated from the statute books
			<lb />
			and even if the amending [repealing] statute is declared unconstitutional on
			<lb />
			the ground of lack of legislative competence in the Legislature, the repealed
			<lb />
			statute will not revive. This is what was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;In State of U.P. v. Hirendra Pal Singh this Court held: (SCC p. 314, para
			<lb />
			22)
			<lb />
			&quot;22. It is a settled legal proposition that whenever an Act is
			<lb />
			repealed, it must be considered as if it had never existed. The
			<lb />
			object of repeal is to obliterate the Act from the statutory books,
			<lb />
			except for certain purposes as provided under Section 6 of the
			<lb />
			General Clauses Act, 1897. Repeal is not a matter of mere form but
			<lb />
			is of substance. Therefore, on repeal, the earlier provisions stand
			<lb />
			obliterated/abrogated/wiped out wholly i.e. pro tanto repeal….&quot;
			<lb />
			Thus, undoubtedly, submission made by the learned Senior Counsel on
			<lb />
			behalf of the respondents that once the Act stands repealed and the
			<lb />
			amending Act is struck down by the Court being invalid and ultra
			<lb />
			vires/unconstitutional on the ground of legislative incompetence, the
			<lb />
			repealed Act will automatically revive is preponderous [preposterous] and
			<lb />
			needs no further consideration. This very Bench in State of U.P. v.
			<lb />
			Hirendra Pal Singh, after placing reliance upon a large number of earlier
			<lb />
			judgments particularly in Ameer-un-Nissa Begum v. Mahboob Begum,
			<lb />

			<lb />
			On the other hand, it is pointed out in paragraph 57 of the Report that if a
			<lb />
			statute is repealed and the new statute is declared unconstitutional on the
			<lb />
			ground that it violates the fundamental rights chapter, then the repealed
			<lb />
			statute revives. It was said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;There is another limb of this legal proposition, that is, where the Act is
			<lb />
			struck down by the Court being invalid, on the ground of arbitrariness in
			<lb />
			view of the provisions of Article 14 of the Constitution or being violative
			<lb />
			of fundamental rights enshrined in Part III of the Constitution, such Act
			<lb />
			can be described as void ab initio meaning thereby unconstitutional,
			<lb />
			stillborn or having no existence at all. In such a situation, the Act which
			<lb />
			stood repealed, stands revived automatically. (See Behram Khurshid
			<lb />
			Pesikaka and Mahendra Lal Jaini.)&quot; (Internal citations omitted)
			<lb />
			There does appear to be a doubt (if not a subtle conflict of views) that needs
			<lb />
			to be resolved in the sense that if a statute is repealed and obliterated from
			<lb />
			the statute books, under what circumstances does the obliteration vanish, if at
			<lb />
			all. However, none of these decisions make any reference to an amendment
			<lb />
			of the Constitution, and for the present it is not necessary to dive into that
			<lb />
			controversy. This is for the simple reason that the issue requires considerable
			<lb />
			debate, of which we did not have the benefit. Justice Khehar has elaborately
			<lb />
			dealt with this issue in his draft judgment but I would like to leave the
			<lb />
			question open for debate on an appropriate occasion. 561.But, quite apart
			<lb />
			from this, if the contention of the learned Solicitor-General is accepted, then
			<lb />
			on the facts of this case, the result would be calamitous. The simple reason is
			<lb />
			that if the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act is struck down as altering the
			<lb />
			basic structure of the Constitution and if Article 124(2) in its original form is
			<lb />
			not revived then Article 124(2) of the Constitution minus the words deleted
			<lb />
			(by the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act) and minus the words struck down
			<lb />
			(those inserted by the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act) would read as
			<lb />
			follows:

			562. This would give absolute power to the President to appoint a judge to
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court without consulting the Chief Justice of India (and also to
			<lb />
			appoint a judge to a High Court). The result of accepting his submission
			<lb />
			would be to create a tyrant, as James Madison put it in the Federalist Papers
			<lb />
			No. 47:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in
			<lb />
			the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary,
			<lb />
			self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of
			<lb />
			tyranny.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			563. This was put to the learned Solicitor-General and it was also put to
			<lb />
			him that if his submissions are correct, then it would be better for the Union
			<lb />
			of India to have the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act struck down so that
			<lb />
			absolute power resides in the President making him/her an Imperium in
			<lb />
			Imperio as far as the appointment of judges is concerned. The learned
			<lb />
			Solicitor-General smiled but obviously had no answer to give. It must,
			<lb />
			therefore, be held that the constitutional provisions amended by the 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitution Amendment Act spring back to life on the declaration that the
			<lb />
			99 th Constitution Amendment Act is unconstitutional.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Conclusions
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			564. Very briefly, Dr. Ambedkar was of the view that the President should
			<lb />
			have some discretion but not unfettered discretion in the appointment of
			<lb />
			judges. The Second Judges case acknowledged that the President has the
			<lb />
			discretion to turn down a recommendation made by the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, but only under certain circumstances. This was the fetter on the
			<lb />
			discretion of the President. However, the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act
			<lb />
			and the NJAC Act have completely taken away the discretion of the
			<lb />
			President to turn down a recommendation for the appointment of a judge,
			<lb />
			reducing the constitutional significance of the President.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			565. Dr. Ambedkar was of the view that the President should have the
			<lb />
			discretion to consult judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts in
			<lb />
			respect of a recommendation for appointment by the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
			The President was
			<lb />
			presented, by Second Judges case and the Third Judges case, with the result
			<lb />
			of the consultation exercise carried out by the Chief Justice of India which
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice of India was mandated to do. It is over and above this that
			<lb />
			the President was entitled to consult other judges of the Supreme Court or
			<lb />
			the High Courts. However, the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the
			<lb />
			NJAC Act have taken away this freedom of consultation from the President,
			<lb />
			who has no option but to take into account only the recommendation of the
			<lb />
			NJAC and not travel beyond that. Once again, the constitutional significance
			<lb />
			and importance of the President is considerably reduced, if not taken away.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			566. Dr. Ambedkar was opposed to the concurrence of the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India (as an individual) in respect of every appointment of a judge. The
			<lb />
			Second Judges case made it mandatory for the Chief Justice of India to take
			<lb />
			the opinion of other judges and also left it open to the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			to consult persons other than judges in this regard. The opinion of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India ceased to be an individual opinion (as per the &apos;desire&apos; of Dr.
			<lb />
			Ambedkar) but became a collective or institutional opinion, there being a
			<lb />
			great deal of difference between the two. However, the 99 th Constitution
			<lb />
			Amendment Act and the NJAC Act have considerably limited and curtailed
			<lb />
			the authority of the Chief Justice of India (both individually as well as
			<lb />
			institutionally) and the Chief Justice of India is now precluded from taking
			<lb />
			the opinion of other judges or of any person outside the NJAC. The Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India has been reduced to an individual figure from an institutional
			<lb />
			head.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			567. Dr. Ambedkar was not prepared to accept the opinion of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India (as an individual) as the final word in the appointment of
			<lb />
			judges. This is because the Chief Justice of India has frailties like all of us.
			<lb />
			The apprehension of Dr. Ambedkar was allayed by the Second Judges case
			<lb />
			and the Third Judges case which made it mandatory for the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India to express a collective opinion and not an individual opinion. The
			<lb />
			collective and unanimous opinion (duly reiterated if necessary) would bind
			<lb />
			the President being the collective and unanimous opinion of persons who
			<lb />
			were ex hypothesi &apos;well qualified to give proper advice in matters of this
			<lb />
			sort.&apos; However, the 99 th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act
			<lb />
			reversed the process well thought out in the Second Judges case and the
			<lb />
			Third Judges case and have taken away the constitutional authority of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of India and placed it on a platter for the NJAC to exploit.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			568. Given our constitutional history, the established conventions, the
			<lb />
			views of various committees over the last seventy years and the views of
			<lb />
			scores of legal luminaries beginning with Mr. Motilal Setalvad, the throes
			<lb />
			through which the judiciary has gone through over several decades and the
			<lb />
			provisions of our Constitution, I hold that the Article 124A as introduced in
			<lb />
			the Constitution by the Constitution (Ninety-ninth Amendment) Act, 2014
			<lb />
			impinges on the independence of the judiciary and in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of judges (which is a foundational and integral part of the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary) and alters the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. It is accordingly declared unconstitutional. The other
			<lb />
			provisions of the Constitution (Ninety-ninth Amendment) Act, 2014 cannot
			<lb />
			stand by themselves and are therefore also declared unconstitutional.
			<lb />
			Similarly, the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014 confers
			<lb />
			arbitrary and unchartered powers on various authorities under the statute and
			<lb />
			it violates Article 14 of the Constitution and is declared unconstitutional.
			<lb />
			Even otherwise, the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014
			<lb />
			cannot stand alone in the absence of the Constitution (Ninety-ninth
			<lb />
			Amendment) Act, 2014.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			569. The result of this declaration is that the &apos;collegium system&apos; postulated
			<lb />
			by the Second Judges case and the Third Judges case gets revived.
			<lb />
			However, the procedure for appointment of judges as laid down in these
			<lb />
			decisions read with the (Revised) Memorandum of Procedure definitely
			<lb />
			needs fine tuning. We had requested learned counsel, on the close of
			<lb />
			submissions, to give suggestions on the basis that the petitions are dismissed
			<lb />
			and on the basis that the petitions are allowed. Unfortunately, we received no
			<lb />
			response, or at best a lukewarm response. Under the circumstances, in my
			<lb />
			opinion, we need to have a &apos;consequence hearing&apos; to assist us in the matter
			<lb />
			for steps to be taken in the future to streamline the process and procedure of
			<lb />
			appointment of judges, to make it more responsive to the needs of the
			<lb />
			people, to make it more transparent and in tune with societal needs, and more
			<lb />
			particularly, to avoid a fifth judges case! I would, therefore, allow the
			<lb />
			petitions but list them for a &apos;consequence hearing&apos; on an appropriate date.

			O R D E R
			<lb />
			KURIAN, J.:
			<lb />
			I wholly agree with the view taken by my esteemed brother,
			<lb />
			Chelameswar, J. that there is no situation warranting recusal
			<lb />
			of Justice Khehar in this case. Now, that we have to pass a
			<lb />
			detailed and reasoned order as to why a Judge need not
			<lb />
			recuse from a case, I feel it appropriate also to deal with the
			<lb />
			REPORTABLE
			<lb />
			other side of the coin, whether a Judge should state reasons
			<lb />
			for his recusal in a particular case.
			<lb />
			One of the reasons for recusal of a Judge is that litigants/the
			<lb />
			public might entertain a reasonable apprehension about his
			<lb />
			impartiality. As Lord Chief Justice Hewart said:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It is not merely of some importance but
			<lb />
			is of fundamental importance that justice
			<lb />
			should not only be done, but should
			<lb />
			manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to
			<lb />
			be done.&quot; 705
			<lb />
			And therefore, in order to uphold the credibility of the
			<lb />
			integrity institution, the Judge recuses from hearing the case.
			<lb />
			A Judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court, while
			<lb />
			assuming Office, takes an oath as prescribed under Schedule
			<lb />
			III to the Constitution of India, that:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;… I will bear true faith and allegiance to the
			<lb />
			Constitution of India as by law established,
			<lb />
			that I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity
			<lb />
			of India, that I will duly and faithfully and to
			<lb />
			the best of my ability, knowledge and
			<lb />
			judgment perform the duties of my office
			<lb />
			without fear or favour, affection or ill-will and
			<lb />
			that I will uphold the Constitution and the
			<lb />
			laws.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Called upon to discharge the duties of the Office without fear
			<lb />
			or favour, affection or ill-will, it is only desirable, if not
			<lb />
			proper, that a Judge, for any unavoidable reason like some
			<lb />
			pecuniary interest, affinity or adversity with the parties in the
			<lb />
			case, direct or indirect interest in the outcome of the
			<lb />
			litigation, family directly involved in litigation on the same
			<lb />
			issue elsewhere, the Judge being aware that he or someone
			<lb />
			in his immediate family has an interest, financial or
			<lb />
			otherwise that could have a substantial bearing as a
			<lb />
			consequence of the decision in the litigation, etc., to recuse
			<lb />
			himself from the adjudication of a particular matter. No
			<lb />
			doubt, these examples are not exhaustive.
			<lb />
			Guidelines on the ethical conduct of the Judges were
			<lb />
			formulated in the Chief Justices&apos; Conference held in 1999
			<lb />
			known as &quot;Restatement of Judicial Values of Judicial Life&quot;.
			<lb />
			Those principles, as a matter of fact, formed the basis of
			<lb />
			&quot;The Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct, 2002&quot;
			<lb />
			formulated at the Round Table Meeting of Chief Justices held
			<lb />
			at the Peace Palace, The Hague. It is seen from the Preamble
			<lb />
			that the Drafting Committee had taken into consideration
			<lb />
			thirty two such statements all over the world including that
			<lb />
			of India. On Value 2 &quot;Impartiality&quot;, it is resolved as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Principle:
			<lb />
			Impartiality is essential to the proper discharge
			<lb />
			of the judicial office. It applies not only to the
			<lb />
			decision itself but also to the process by which
			<lb />
			the decision is made.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Application:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			2.1 A judge shall perform his or her judicial
			<lb />
			duties without favour, bias or prejudice.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			2.2 A judge shall ensure that his or her
			<lb />
			conduct, both in and out of court,
			<lb />
			maintains and enhances the confidence
			<lb />
			of the public, the legal profession and
			<lb />
			litigants in the impartiality of the judge
			<lb />
			and of the judiciary.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			2.3 A judge shall, so far as is reasonable, so
			<lb />
			conduct himself or herself as to minimise
			<lb />
			the occasions on which it will be
			<lb />
			necessary for the judge to be disqualified
			<lb />
			from hearing or deciding cases.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			2.4 A judge shall not knowingly, while a
			<lb />
			proceeding is before, or could come
			<lb />
			before, the judge, make any comment
			<lb />
			that might reasonably be expected to
			<lb />
			affect the outcome of such proceeding or
			<lb />
			impair the manifest fairness of the
			<lb />
			process. Nor shall the judge make any
			<lb />
			comment in public or otherwise that
			<lb />
			might affect the fair trial of any person or
			<lb />
			issue.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			2.5 A judge shall disqualify himself or herself
			<lb />
			from participating in any proceedings in
			<lb />
			which the judge is unable to decide the
			<lb />
			matter impartially or in which it may
			<lb />
			appear to a reasonable observer that the
			<lb />
			judge is unable to decide the matter
			<lb />
			impartially. Such proceedings include, but
			<lb />
			are not limited to, instances where
			<lb />
			2.5.1the judge has actual bias or
			<lb />
			prejudice concerning a party or
			<lb />
			personal knowledge of disputed
			<lb />
			evidentiary facts concerning
			<lb />
			the proceedings;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			2.5.2the judge previously served as
			<lb />
			a lawyer or was a material
			<lb />
			witness in the matter in
			<lb />
			controversy; or
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			2.5.3the judge, or a member of the
			<lb />
			judge&apos;s
			<lb />
			family,
			<lb />
			has
			<lb />
			an
			<lb />
			economic
			<lb />
			interest
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			outcome of the matter in
			<lb />
			controversy:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Provided that disqualification of a judge
			<lb />
			shall not be required if no other tribunal can be
			<lb />
			constituted to deal with the case or, because
			<lb />
			of urgent circumstances, failure to act could
			<lb />
			lead to a serious miscarriage of justice.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The simple question is, whether the adjudication by the
			<lb />
			Judge concerned, would cause a reasonable doubt in the
			<lb />
			mind of a reasonably informed litigant and fair-minded public
			<lb />
			as to his impartiality. Being an institution whose hallmark is
			<lb />
			transparency, it is only proper that the Judge discharging
			<lb />
			high and noble duties, at least broadly indicate the reasons
			<lb />
			for recusing from the case so that the litigants or the
			<lb />
			well-meaning public may not entertain any misunderstanding
			<lb />
			that the recusal was for altogether irrelevant reasons like the
			<lb />
			cases being very old, involving detailed consideration,
			<lb />
			decision on several questions of law, a situation where the
			<lb />
			Judge is not happy with the roster, a Judge getting unduly
			<lb />
			sensitive about the public perception of his image, Judge
			<lb />
			wanting not to cause displeasure to anybody, Judge always
			<lb />
			wanting not to decide any sensitive or controversial issues,
			<lb />
			etc. Once reasons for recusal are indicated, there will not be
			<lb />
			any room for attributing any motive for the recusal. To put it
			<lb />
			differently, it is part of his duty to be accountable to the
			<lb />
			Constitution by upholding it without fear or favour, affection
			<lb />
			or ill-will.
			<lb />
			Therefore, I am of the view that it is the
			<lb />
			constitutional duty, as reflected in one&apos;s oath, to be
			<lb />
			transparent and accountable, and hence, a Judge is required
			<lb />
			to indicate reasons for his recusal from a particular case. This
			<lb />
			would help to curb the tendency for forum shopping.
			<lb />
			In Public Utilities Commission of District of Columbia
			<lb />
			et al. v. Pollak et al. 706 , the Supreme Court of United
			<lb />
			States dealt with a question whether in the District of
			<lb />
			Columbia, the Constitution of the United States precludes a
			<lb />
			street railway company from receiving and amplifying radio
			<lb />
			programmes through loudspeakers in its passenger vehicles.
			<lb />
			Justice Frankfurter was always averse to the practice and he
			<lb />
			was of the view that it is not proper. His personal philosophy
			<lb />
			and his stand on the course apparently, were known to the
			<lb />
			people. Even otherwise, he was convinced of his strong
			<lb />
			position on this issue. Therefore, stating so, he recused from
			<lb />
			participating in the case. To quote his words,
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The judicial process demands that a judge
			<lb />
			move within the framework of relevant legal
			<lb />
			rules and the covenanted modes of thought for
			<lb />
			ascertaining
			<lb />
			them.
			<lb />
			He
			<lb />
			must
			<lb />
			think
			<lb />
			dispassionately and submerge private feeling
			<lb />
			on every aspect of a case. There is a good
			<lb />
			deal of shallow talk that the judicial robe does
			<lb />
			not change the man within it. It does. The
			<lb />
			fact is that on the whole judges do lay aside
			<lb />
			private views in discharging their judicial
			<lb />
			functions. This is achieved through training,
			<lb />
			professional habits, self-discipline and that
			<lb />
			fortunate alchemy by which men are loyal to
			<lb />
			the obligation with which they are entrusted.
			<lb />
			But it is also true that reason cannot control
			<lb />
			the subconscious influence of feelings of which
			<lb />
			it is unaware.
			<lb />
			When there is ground for
			<lb />
			believing that such unconscious feelings may
			<lb />
			operate in the ultimate judgment, or may not
			<lb />
			unfairly lead others to believe they are
			<lb />
			operating, judges recuse themselves. They do
			<lb />
			not sit in judgment. They do this for a variety
			<lb />
			of reasons. The guiding consideration is that
			<lb />
			the administration of justice should reasonably
			<lb />
			appear to be disinterested as well as be so in
			<lb />
			fact.
			<lb />
			This case for me presents such a situation. My
			<lb />
			feelings are so strongly engaged as a victim of
			<lb />
			the practice in controversy that I had better
			<lb />
			not participate in judicial judgment upon it. I
			<lb />
			am explicit as to the reason for my
			<lb />
			non-participation in this case because I have
			<lb />
			for some time been of the view that it is
			<lb />
			desirable to state why one takes himself out of
			<lb />
			a case.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			According to Justice Mathew in S. Parthasarathi v. State
			<lb />
			of A.P. 707 , in case, the right-minded persons entertain a
			<lb />
			feeling that there is any likelihood of bias on the part of the
			<lb />
			Judge, he must recuse. Mere possibility of such a feeling is
			<lb />
			not enough.
			<lb />
			There must exist circumstances where a
			<lb />
			reasonable and fair-minded man would think it probably or
			<lb />
			likely that the Judge would be prejudiced against a litigant.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			To quote:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;The tests of &quot;real likelihood&quot; and &quot;reasonable
			<lb />
			suspicion&quot; are really inconsistent with each
			<lb />
			other. We think that the reviewing authority
			<lb />
			must make a determination on the basis of the
			<lb />
			whole evidence before it, whether a
			<lb />
			reasonable man would in the circumstances
			<lb />
			infer that there is real likelihood of bias. The
			<lb />
			Court must look at the impression which other
			<lb />
			people have. This follows from the principle
			<lb />
			that Justice must not only be done but seen to
			<lb />
			be done. If right minded persons would think
			<lb />
			that there is real likelihood of bias on the part
			<lb />
			of an inquiring officer, he must not conduct the
			<lb />
			inquiry; nevertheless, there must be a real
			<lb />
			likelihood of bias. Surmise or conjecture would
			<lb />
			not be
			<lb />
			enough.
			<lb />
			There
			<lb />
			must exist
			<lb />
			circumstances from which reasonable men
			<lb />
			would think it probable or likely that the
			<lb />
			inquiring officer will be prejudiced against the
			<lb />
			delinquent. The Court will not inquire whether
			<lb />
			he was really prejudiced. If a reasonable man
			<lb />
			would think on the basis of the existing
			<lb />
			circumstances that he is likely to be
			<lb />
			prejudiced, that is sufficient to quash the
			<lb />
			decision [see per Lord Denning, H.R. in
			<lb />
			(Metropolitan Properties Co. (F.G.C.) Ltd. v.
			<lb />
			Lannon and Others, etc. [(1968) 3 WLR 694 at
			<lb />
			707]). We should not, however, be understood
			<lb />
			to deny that the Court might with greater
			<lb />
			propriety apply the &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; test
			<lb />
			in criminal or in proceedings analogous to
			<lb />
			criminal proceedings.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			There may be situations where the mischievous litigants
			<lb />
			wanting to avoid a Judge may be because he is known to
			<lb />
			them to be very strong and thus making an attempt for
			<lb />
			forum shopping by raising baseless submissions on conflict
			<lb />
			of interest. In the Constitutional Court of South Africa in The
			<lb />
			President of the Republic of South Africa etc. v. South
			<lb />
			African Rugby Football Union etc. 708 , has made two very
			<lb />
			relevant observations in this regard:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Although it is important that justice must
			<lb />
			be seen to be done, it is equally
			<lb />
			important that judicial officers discharge
			<lb />
			their duty to sit and do not, by acceding
			<lb />
			too readily to suggestions of appearance
			<lb />
			of bias, encourage parties to believe that
			<lb />
			by seeking the disqualification of a judge,
			<lb />
			they will have their case tried by
			<lb />
			someone thought to be more likely to
			<lb />
			decide the case in their favour.&quot;
			<lb />
			&quot;It needs to be said loudly and clearly
			<lb />
			that the ground of disqualification is a
			<lb />
			reasonable apprehension that the judicial
			<lb />
			officer will not decide the case impartially
			<lb />
			or without prejudice, rather than that he
			<lb />
			will decide the case adversely to one
			<lb />
			party.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Ultimately, the question is whether a fair-minded and
			<lb />
			reasonably informed person, on correct facts, would
			<lb />
			reasonably entertain a doubt on the impartiality of the Judge.
			<lb />
			The reasonableness of the apprehension must be assessed in
			<lb />
			the light of the oath of Office he has taken as a Judge to
			<lb />
			administer justice without fear or favour, affection or ill-will
			<lb />
			and his ability to carry out the oath by reason of his training
			<lb />
			and experience whereby he is in a position to disabuse his
			<lb />
			mind of any irrelevant personal belief or pre-disposition or
			<lb />
			unwarranted apprehensions of his image in public or
			<lb />
			difficulty in deciding a controversial issue particularly when
			<lb />
			the same is highly sensitive.
			<lb />
			These issues have been succinctly discussed by the
			<lb />
			Constitutional Court in The President of the Republic of
			<lb />
			South Africa (supra), on an application for recusal of four of
			<lb />
			the Judges in the Constitutional Court. After elaborately
			<lb />
			considering the factual matrix as well as the legal position,
			<lb />
			the Court held as follows:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;While litigants have the right to apply for the
			<lb />
			recusal of judicial officers where there is a
			<lb />
			reasonable apprehension that they will not
			<lb />
			decide a case impartially, this does not give
			<lb />
			them the right to object to their cases being
			<lb />
			heard by particular judicial officers simply
			<lb />
			because they believe that such persons will be
			<lb />
			less likely to decide the case in their favour,
			<lb />
			than would other judicial officers drawn from a
			<lb />
			different segment of society. The nature of the
			<lb />
			judicial function involves the performance of
			<lb />
			difficult and at times unpleasant tasks. Judicial
			<lb />
			officers
			<lb />
			are
			<lb />
			nonetheless
			<lb />
			required
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			&quot;administer justice to all persons alike without
			<lb />
			fear, favour or prejudice, in accordance with
			<lb />
			the Constitution and the law&quot;. To this end they
			<lb />
			must resist all manner of pressure, regardless
			<lb />
			of where it comes from.
			<lb />
			This is the
			<lb />
			constitutional duty common to all judicial
			<lb />
			officers. If they deviate, the independence of
			<lb />
			the judiciary would be undermined, and in
			<lb />
			turn, the Constitution itself.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The above principles are universal in application.
			<lb />
			Impartiality of a Judge is the sine qua non for the integrity
			<lb />
			institution. Transparency in procedure is one of the major
			<lb />
			factors constituting the integrity of the office of a Judge in
			<lb />
			conducting his duties and the functioning of the court. The
			<lb />
			litigants would always like to know though they may not
			<lb />
			have a prescribed right to know, as to why a Judge has
			<lb />
			recused from hearing the case or despite request, has not
			<lb />
			recused to hear his case. Reasons are required to be
			<lb />
			indicated broadly. Of course, in case the disclosure of the
			<lb />
			reasons is likely to affect prejudicially any case or cause or
			<lb />
			interest of someone else, the Judge is free to state that on
			<lb />
			account of personal reasons which the Judge does not want
			<lb />
			to disclose, he has decided to recuse himself from hearing
			<lb />
			the case.

			REPORTABLE
			<lb />
			KURIAN, J.:
			<lb />
			Entia Non Sunt Multiplicanda Sine Necessitate (Things should
			<lb />
			not be multiplied without necessity). This is the first thought
			<lb />
			which came to my mind after reading the judgments
			<lb />
			authored by my noble brothers Khehar, Chelameswar, Lokur
			<lb />
			and Goel, JJ., exhaustively dealing with the subject. The
			<lb />
			entire gamut of the issue has been dealt with from all
			<lb />
			possible angles after referring extensively to the precedents,
			<lb />
			academic discourses and judgments of various other
			<lb />
			countries. Though I cannot, in all humility, claim to match the
			<lb />
			level of such masterpieces, it is a fact that I too had drafted
			<lb />
			my judgment. However, in view of the principle enunciated
			<lb />
			above on unnecessary multiplication, I decided to undo
			<lb />
			major portion of what I have done, also for the reason that
			<lb />
			the judgment of this Bench should not be accused of Bharati
			<lb />
			fate (His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru
			<lb />
			v. State of Kerala and another 709 has always been
			<lb />
			criticized on that account).
			<lb />
			Leaving all legal jargons and using a language of the
			<lb />
			common man, the core issue before us is the validity of the
			<lb />
			Constitution
			<lb />
			99th amendment. It is to be tested on
			<lb />
			the touchstone of the theory of the basic structure. The
			<lb />
			amendment has introduced a new constitutional scheme for
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the High Courts and the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court. During the first phase of the working of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, the Executive claimed an upper hand in the
			<lb />
			appointment and the Chief Justice of India or the Chief
			<lb />
			Justices of the High Courts concerned were only to be
			<lb />
			&apos;consulted&apos;, the expression often understood in its literal
			<lb />
			sense. In other words, the decision was taken by the
			<lb />
			Executive with the participation of the Chief Justice. This
			<lb />
			process fell for scrutiny in one of the celebrated decisions of
			<lb />
			this Court in Samsher Singh v. State of Punjab and
			<lb />
			another 710 .
			<lb />
			In Samsher Singh case (supra), a seven-Judge Bench of this
			<lb />
			Court, in unmistakable terms, held at paragraph 149 as
			<lb />
			follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;149. … The independence of the Judiciary,
			<lb />
			which is a cardinal principle of the Constitution
			<lb />
			and has been relied on to justify the deviation,
			<lb />
			is guarded by the relevant article making
			<lb />
			consultation with the Chief Justice of India
			<lb />
			obligatory.
			<lb />
			In
			<lb />
			all
			<lb />
			conceivable
			<lb />
			cases
			<lb />
			consultation with that highest dignitary of
			<lb />
			Indian justice will and should be accepted by
			<lb />
			the Government of India and the Court will
			<lb />
			have an opportunity to examine if any other
			<lb />
			extraneous circumstances have entered into
			<lb />
			the verdict of the Minister, if he departs from
			<lb />
			the counsel given by the Chief Justice of India.
			<lb />
			In practice the last word in such a sensitive
			<lb />
			subject must belong to the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			India, the rejection of his advice being
			<lb />
			ordinarily regarded as prompted by oblique
			<lb />
			considerations vitiating the order. In this view
			<lb />
			it is immaterial whether the President or the
			<lb />
			Prime Minister or the Minister for Justice
			<lb />
			formally decides the issue.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
			This principle, settled by a Bench of seven Judges, should
			<lb />
			have been taken as binding by the Bench dealing with the
			<lb />
			First Judges Case which had a coram only of seven.
			<lb />
			Unfortunately, it held otherwise, though with a majority of
			<lb />
			four against three. Strangely, the presiding Judge in the First
			<lb />
			Judges case and author of the majority view, was a member
			<lb />
			who concurred with the majority in Samsher Singh
			<lb />
			case (supra) and yet there was not even a reference to that
			<lb />
			judgment in the lead judgment! Had there been a proper
			<lb />
			advertence to Samsher Singh case (supra), probably there
			<lb />
			would not have been any need for the Second Judges Case.
			<lb />
			It appears, the restlessness on the incorrect interpretation of
			<lb />
			the constitutional structure and position of judiciary in the
			<lb />
			matter of appointments with the super voice of the
			<lb />
			Executive, as endorsed in the First Judges Case, called for a
			<lb />
			serious revisit leading to the Second Judges Case. Paragraph
			<lb />
			85 of the Judgment gives adequate reference to the
			<lb />
			background. To quote:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;85. Regrettably, there are some
			<lb />
			intractable problems concerned with
			<lb />
			judicial administration starting from the
			<lb />
			initial stage of selection of candidates to
			<lb />
			man the Supreme Court and the High
			<lb />
			Courts leading to the present malaise.
			<lb />
			Therefore, it has become inevitable that
			<lb />
			effective steps have to be taken to
			<lb />
			improve or retrieve the situation. After
			<lb />
			taking note of these problems and
			<lb />
			realising the devastating consequences
			<lb />
			that may flow, one cannot be a silent
			<lb />
			spectator or an old inveterate optimist,
			<lb />
			looking upon the other constitutional
			<lb />
			functionaries, particularly the executive,
			<lb />
			in the fond hope of getting invigorative
			<lb />
			solutions to make the justice delivery
			<lb />
			system more effective and resilient to
			<lb />
			meet the contemporary needs of the
			<lb />
			society, which hopes, as experience
			<lb />
			shows, have never been successful.
			<lb />
			Therefore, faced with such a piquant
			<lb />
			situation, it has become imperative for
			<lb />
			us to solve these problems within the
			<lb />
			constitutional fabric by interpreting the
			<lb />
			various provisions of the Constitution
			<lb />
			relating to the functioning of the
			<lb />
			judiciary in the light of the letter and
			<lb />
			spirit of the Constitution.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The nine-Judges Bench in the Second Judges Case overruled
			<lb />
			the First Judges Case, after a threadbare analysis of the
			<lb />
			relevant provisions &apos;in the light of the letter and spirit of the
			<lb />
			Constitution&apos;, holding that appointment of Judges to the High
			<lb />
			Courts and the Supreme Court forms an integral part of the
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary, that independence of judiciary is
			<lb />
			part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India, and
			<lb />
			therefore, the Executive cannot interfere with the primacy of
			<lb />
			the judiciary in the matter of appointments. Third Judges
			<lb />
			Case, in 1998, is only an explanatory extension of the
			<lb />
			working of the principles in the Second Judges Case by
			<lb />
			institutionalizing the procedure of appointment, introducing
			<lb />
			the Collegium.
			<lb />
			Thus, the structural supremacy of the judiciary in the
			<lb />
			constitutionally allotted sphere was restored by the Second
			<lb />
			and Third Judges Cases.
			<lb />
			Apparently, on account of certain allegedly undeserving
			<lb />
			appointments, which in fact affected the image of the
			<lb />
			judiciary, the politico Executive started a new campaign
			<lb />
			demanding reconsideration of the procedure of appointment.
			<lb />
			It was clamoured that the system of Judges appointing
			<lb />
			Judges is not in the spirit of the Constitution, and hence, the
			<lb />
			whole process required a structural alteration, and thus, the
			<lb />
			Constitution 99 th Amendment whereby the selection is left to
			<lb />
			a third body, the National Judicial Appointments Commission
			<lb />
			(NJAC). The Parliament also passed the National Judicial
			<lb />
			Appointments Commission Act, 2014, which is only a
			<lb />
			creature of Constitution 99 th Amendment. The validity of the
			<lb />
			Act is also under challenge.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&apos;What is the big deal about it?&apos;, has been the oft made
			<lb />
			observation of my esteemed brother Khehar, J., the presiding
			<lb />
			Judge, in the thirty days of the hearing of the case, which
			<lb />
			included an unusual two weeks long sitting during the
			<lb />
			summer vacations with the hearing in three different Courts,
			<lb />
			viz., Court Nos. 3, 4 and 6. When it is held, and rightly so,
			<lb />
			that there is no requirement for reconsideration of the
			<lb />
			Second Judges Case, the fate of the case is sealed; there is
			<lb />
			no need for any further deal, big or small. Though I generally
			<lb />
			agree with the analysis and statement of law, in the matter
			<lb />
			of discussion and summarization of the principles on
			<lb />
			reconsideration of judgments made by Lokur, J. at paragraph
			<lb />
			263, I would like to add one more, as the tenth. Once this
			<lb />
			Court has addressed an issue on a substantial question of
			<lb />
			law as to the structure of the Constitution and has laid down
			<lb />
			the law, a request for revisit shall not be welcomed unless it
			<lb />
			is shown that the structural interpretation is palpably
			<lb />
			erroneous. None before us could blur the graphic picture on
			<lb />
			the scheme of appointment of Judges and its solid structural
			<lb />
			base in the Constitution portrayed in the Second Judges
			<lb />
			Case. This Bench is bound by the ratio that independence of
			<lb />
			judiciary is part of the basic structure of Constitution and
			<lb />
			that the appointment of Judges to the High Courts and the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court is an integral part of the concept of
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary. And for that simple reason, the
			<lb />
			Constitution 99 th Amendment is bound to be declared
			<lb />
			unconstitutional and I do so. Thus, I wholly agree with the
			<lb />
			view taken by Khehar, Lokur and Goel, JJ., that the
			<lb />
			amendment is unconstitutional and I respectfully disagree
			<lb />
			with the view taken by Chelameswar, J. in that regard. Since
			<lb />
			it is being held by the majority that the amendment itself is
			<lb />
			bad, there is no point in dealing with the validity of the
			<lb />
			creature of the amendment, viz., the National Judicial
			<lb />
			Appointments Commission Act, 2014. It does not exist under
			<lb />
			law. Why then write the horoscope of a stillborn child!
			<lb />
			However, I would like to provide one more prod. Professor
			<lb />
			Philip Bobbit in his famous book &apos;Constitutional Fate Theory
			<lb />
			of the Constitution&apos;, has dealt with a typology of
			<lb />
			constitutional arguments. To him, there are five archetypes:
			<lb />
			historical, textual, structural, prudential and doctrinal. To
			<lb />
			quote from Chapter 1:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Historical argument is argument that
			<lb />
			marshals the intent of the draftsmen of the
			<lb />
			Constitution and the people who adopted the
			<lb />
			Constitution. Such arguments begin with
			<lb />
			assertions about the controversies, the
			<lb />
			attitudes, and decisions of the period during
			<lb />
			which the particular constitutional provision
			<lb />
			to be construed was proposed and ratified.
			<lb />
			The second archetype is textual
			<lb />
			argument, argument that is drawn from a
			<lb />
			consideration of the present sense of the
			<lb />
			words of the provision. At times textual
			<lb />
			argument
			<lb />
			is
			<lb />
			confused
			<lb />
			with
			<lb />
			historical
			<lb />
			argument, which requires the consideration of
			<lb />
			evidence extrinsic to the text. The third type
			<lb />
			of constitutional argument in structural
			<lb />
			argument. Structural arguments are claims
			<lb />
			that a particular principle or practical result is
			<lb />
			implicit in the structures of government and
			<lb />
			the relationships that are created by the
			<lb />
			Constitution
			<lb />
			among
			<lb />
			citizens
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			governments.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			fourth
			<lb />
			type
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			constitutional
			<lb />
			argument
			<lb />
			is
			<lb />
			prudential
			<lb />
			argument.
			<lb />
			Prudential
			<lb />
			argument
			<lb />
			is
			<lb />
			self-conscious to the reviewing institution and
			<lb />
			need not treat the merits of the particular
			<lb />
			controversy (which itself may or may not be
			<lb />
			constitutional), instead advancing particular
			<lb />
			doctrines according to the practical wisdom of
			<lb />
			using the courts in a particular way.
			<lb />
			Finally, there is doctrinal argument,
			<lb />
			argument that asserts principles derived from
			<lb />
			precedent or from judicial or academic
			<lb />
			commentary on precedent.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Professor (Dr.) Upendra Baxi has yet another tool -&apos;episodic&apos;,
			<lb />
			which according to him, is often wrongly used in interpreting
			<lb />
			the Constitution. To Dr. Baxi, &apos;structural&apos; is the most
			<lb />
			important argument while interpreting the Constitution.
			<lb />
			Structural argument is further explained in Chapter 6. To
			<lb />
			quote a few observations:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Structural arguments are inferences
			<lb />
			from the existence of constitutional structures
			<lb />
			and the relationships which the Constitution
			<lb />
			ordains among these structures. They are to
			<lb />
			be distinguished from textual and historical
			<lb />
			arguments, which construe a particular
			<lb />
			constitutional passage and then use that
			<lb />
			construction in the reasoning of an opinion.&quot;
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;Structural
			<lb />
			arguments
			<lb />
			are
			<lb />
			largely
			<lb />
			factless and depend on deceptively simple
			<lb />
			logical moves from the entire Constitutional
			<lb />
			text rather than from one of its parts. At the
			<lb />
			same time, they embody a macroscopic
			<lb />
			prudentialism drawing not on the peculiar
			<lb />
			facts of the case but rather arising from
			<lb />
			general assertions about power and social
			<lb />
			choice.&quot;
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;Notice that the structural approach,
			<lb />
			unlike much doctrinalism, is grounded in the
			<lb />
			actual text of the Constitution. But, unlike
			<lb />
			textualist arguments, the passages that are
			<lb />
			significant are not those of express grants of
			<lb />
			power or particular prohibitions but instead
			<lb />
			those which, by setting up structures of a
			<lb />
			certain kind, permit us to draw the
			<lb />
			requirements of the relationships among
			<lb />
			structures.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Professor Bobbit has also dealt with a sixth approach -
			<lb />
			ethical, which according to him, is seldom used in
			<lb />
			constitutional law. In interpreting the Constitution, all the
			<lb />
			tools are to be appropriately used, and quite often, in
			<lb />
			combination too. The three constitutional wings, their powers
			<lb />
			and functions under the Constitution, and their intra
			<lb />
			relationship being the key issues to be analysed in the
			<lb />
			present case, I am of the view that the &apos;structural tool&apos; is to
			<lb />
			be prominently applied for resolving the issues arising in the
			<lb />
			case. In support, I shall refer to a recent judgment of the U.S.
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in State v. Arizona Independent
			<lb />
			Redistricting Commission 711 , decided on 29.06.2015. It is
			<lb />
			an interesting case, quite relevant to our discussion. U.S.
			<lb />
			Constitution Article I, Section 4 ,Clause 1 (Election Clause)
			<lb />
			reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The Times, Places and Manner of holding
			<lb />
			Elections for Senators and Representatives,
			<lb />
			shall be prescribed in each State by the
			<lb />
			Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at
			<lb />
			any time by Law make or alter such
			<lb />
			Regulations, except as to the Places of
			<lb />
			chusing Senators.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Arizona Constitution, Article IV, Part 1, to the extent relevant,
			<lb />
			reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Section
			<lb />
			1.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(1)
			<lb />
			Senate;
			<lb />
			house
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			representatives; reservation of power to
			<lb />
			people. The legislative authority of the state
			<lb />
			shall be vested in the legislature, consisting
			<lb />
			of a senate and a house of representatives,
			<lb />
			but the people reserve the power to propose
			<lb />
			laws and amendments to the constitution and
			<lb />
			to enact or reject such laws and amendments
			<lb />
			at the polls, independently of the legislature;
			<lb />
			and they also reserve, for use at their own
			<lb />
			option, the power to approve or reject at the
			<lb />
			polls any act, or item, section, or part of any
			<lb />
			act, of the legislature.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Thus, under Section 1, people are involved in direct
			<lb />
			legislation either by the process known as &apos;initiative&apos; or
			<lb />
			&apos;referendum&apos;. While the initiative allows the electorate to
			<lb />
			adopt positive legislation, referendum is meant as a negative
			<lb />
			check. Popularly, the process of initiative is said to correct
			<lb />
			&apos;sins of omission&apos; by the Legislature while the referendum
			<lb />
			corrects &apos;sins of commission&apos; by the Legislature.
			<lb />
			In 2000, Arizona voters adopted Proposition 106, an initiative
			<lb />
			aimed at the problem of gerrymandering. Proposition 106
			<lb />
			amended Arizona&apos;s Constitution, removing redistricting
			<lb />
			authority from the Arizona Legislature and vesting it in an
			<lb />
			independent
			<lb />
			commission,
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			Arizona
			<lb />
			Independent
			<lb />
			Redistricting Commission (AIRC). After the 2010 census, as
			<lb />
			after the 2000 census, the AIRC adopted redistricting maps
			<lb />
			for congressional as well as state legislative districts. The
			<lb />
			Arizona Legislature challenged the map which the
			<lb />
			Commission adopted in 2012 for congressional districts
			<lb />
			arguing that the AIRC and its map violated the &quot;Elections
			<lb />
			Clause&quot; of the U.S. Constitution.
			<lb />
			Justice Ginsburg and four other Justices formed the majority
			<lb />
			and held that the independent commission is competent to
			<lb />
			provide for redistricting. To quote the main reasoning:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The Framers may not have imagined the
			<lb />
			modern initiative process in which the
			<lb />
			people&apos;s legislative powers is coextensive
			<lb />
			with the state legislature&apos;s authority, but the
			<lb />
			invention of the initiative was in full harmony
			<lb />
			with the Constitution&apos;s conception of the
			<lb />
			people as the font of governmental power.&quot;
			<lb />
			However, Chief Justice Roberts and three other Justices
			<lb />
			dissented. Chief Justice Roberts pointed out that the majority
			<lb />
			position has no basis in the text, structure, or history of the
			<lb />
			Constitution and it contradicts precedents from both
			<lb />
			Congress and the Supreme Court. The Constitution contains
			<lb />
			seventeen provisions referring to the &apos;Legislature&apos; of a State,
			<lb />
			many of which cannot possibly be read to mean &apos;the people&apos;.
			<lb />
			To quote further:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The majority largely ignores this evidence, relying
			<lb />
			instead on disconnected observations about direct
			<lb />
			democracy, a contorted interpretation of an
			<lb />
			irrelevant statute, and naked appeals to public
			<lb />
			policy. Nowhere does the majority explain how a
			<lb />
			constitutional provision that vests redistricting
			<lb />
			authority in &quot;the Legislature&quot; permits a State to
			<lb />
			wholly exclude &quot;the Legislature&quot; from redistricting.
			<lb />
			Arizona&apos;s Commission might be a &quot;noble endeavor&quot;
			<lb />
			although it does not seem so &quot;independent&quot; in
			<lb />
			practice but the &quot;fact that a given law or procedure
			<lb />
			is efficient, convenient, and useful ... will not save
			<lb />
			it if it is contrary to the Constitution&quot; INS v.
			<lb />
			Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 944 (1983).&quot;

		<item>
			&quot;The constitutional text, structure, history, and
			<lb />
			precedent establish a straightforward rule: Under
			<lb />
			the Elections Clause, &quot;the Legislature&quot; is a
			<lb />
			representative body that, when it prescribes
			<lb />
			election regulations, may be required to do so
			<lb />
			within the ordinary lawmaking process, but may
			<lb />
			not be cut out of that process. Put simply, the state
			<lb />
			legislature need not be exclusive in congressional
			<lb />
			districting, but neither may it be excluded.&quot;

			&quot;The majority today shows greater concern about
			<lb />
			redistricting practices than about the meaning of
			<lb />
			the Constitution. I recognize the difficulties that
			<lb />
			arise from trying to fashion judicial relief for
			<lb />
			partisan gerrymandering. See Vieth v. Jubelirer,
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			U.S. 267 (2004); ante, at 1. But our inability to
			<lb />
			find a manageable standard in that area is no
			<lb />
			excuse to abandon a standard of meaningful
			<lb />
			interpretation in this area. This Court has stressed
			<lb />
			repeatedly that a law&apos;s virtues as a policy
			<lb />
			innovation cannot redeem its inconsistency with
			<lb />
			the Constitution.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
			While wholly agreeing with the historic, textual, prudential
			<lb />
			and doctrinal approaches made by Khehar and Lokur, JJ., my
			<lb />
			additional stress is on the structural part. The minority in
			<lb />
			Arizona case (supra), to me, is the correct approach to be
			<lb />
			made in this case.
			<lb />
			Separation of powers or say distribution of powers, as
			<lb />
			brother Lokur, J. terms it, is the tectonic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution of India. The various checks and balances are
			<lb />
			provided only for maintaining a proper equilibrium amongst
			<lb />
			the structures and that is the supreme beauty of our
			<lb />
			Constitution. Under our constitutional scheme, one branch
			<lb />
			does not interfere impermissibly with the constitutionally
			<lb />
			assigned powers and functions of another branch. The
			<lb />
			permissible areas of interference are the checks and
			<lb />
			balances. But there are certain exclusive areas for each,
			<lb />
			branch which Khehar, J. has stated as &apos;core functions&apos;, and
			<lb />
			which I would describe as powers central. There shall be no
			<lb />
			interference on powers central of each branch. What the
			<lb />
			Constitution is, is only for the court to define; whereas what
			<lb />
			the constitutional aspirations are for the other branches to
			<lb />
			detail and demonstrate. As held in Samsher Singh
			<lb />
			case (supra) and the Second and Third Judges Cases,
			<lb />
			selection of Judges for appointment in High Courts and the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court belongs to the powers central of the Judiciary
			<lb />
			and the permissible checks and balances are provided to
			<lb />
			other branches lie in the sphere of appointment. If the
			<lb />
			alignment of tectonic plates on distribution of powers is
			<lb />
			disturbed, it will quake the Constitution. Once the
			<lb />
			constitutional structure is shaken, democracy collapses. That
			<lb />
			is our own painful history of the Emergency. It is the
			<lb />
			Parliament, in post-Emergency, which corrected the
			<lb />
			constitutional perversions and restored the supremacy of
			<lb />
			rule of law which is the cornerstone of our Constitution. As
			<lb />
			guardian of the Constitution, this Court should vigilantly
			<lb />
			protect the pristine purity and integrity of the basic structure
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. Direct participation of the Executive or
			<lb />
			other non-judicial elements would ultimately lead to
			<lb />
			structured bargaining in appointments, if not, anything
			<lb />
			worse. Any attempt by diluting the basic structure to create a
			<lb />
			committed judiciary, however remote be the possibility, is to
			<lb />
			be nipped in the bud. According to Justice Roberts, court has
			<lb />
			no power to gerrymander the Constitution. Contextually, I
			<lb />
			would say, the Parliament has no power to gerrymander the
			<lb />
			Constitution. The Constitution 99 th amendment impairs the
			<lb />
			structural distribution of powers, and hence, it is
			<lb />
			impermissible.
			<lb />
			One word on the consequence. Though elaborate arguments
			<lb />
			have been addressed that even if the constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment is struck down, the Collegium does not
			<lb />
			resurrect, according to me, does not appeal even to common
			<lb />
			sense. The 99 th Amendment sought to &apos;substitute&apos; a few
			<lb />
			provisions in the Constitution and &apos;insert&apos; a few new
			<lb />
			provisions. Once the process of substitution and insertion by
			<lb />
			way of a constitutional amendment is itself held to be bad
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			impermissible,
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			pre-amended
			<lb />
			provisions
			<lb />
			automatically resurface and revive. That alone can be the
			<lb />
			reasonably inferential conclusion. Legal parlance and
			<lb />
			common parlance may be different but there cannot be any
			<lb />
			legal sense of an issue which does not appeal to common
			<lb />
			sense.
			<lb />
			All told, all was and is not well. To that extent, I agree with
			<lb />
			Chelameswar, J. that the present Collegium system lacks
			<lb />
			transparency, accountability and objectivity. The trust deficit
			<lb />
			has affected the credibility of the Collegium system, as
			<lb />
			sometimes observed by the civic society. Quite often, very
			<lb />
			serious allegations and many a time not unfounded too, have
			<lb />
			been raised that its approach has been highly subjective.
			<lb />
			Deserving persons have been ignored wholly for subjective
			<lb />
			reasons, social and other national realities were overlooked,
			<lb />
			certain appointments were purposely delayed so as either to
			<lb />
			benefit vested choices or to deny such benefits to the less
			<lb />
			patronised, selection of patronised or favoured persons were
			<lb />
			made in blatant violation of the guidelines resulting in
			<lb />
			unmerited, if not, bad appointments, the dictatorial attitude
			<lb />
			of the Collegium seriously affecting the self-respect and
			<lb />
			dignity, if not, independence of Judges, the court, particularly
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court, often being styled as the Court of the
			<lb />
			Collegium, the looking forward syndrome affecting impartial
			<lb />
			assessment, etc., have been some of the other allegations in
			<lb />
			the air for quite some time. These allegations certainly call
			<lb />
			for a deep introspection as to whether the institutional
			<lb />
			trusteeship has kept up the expectations of the framers of
			<lb />
			the Constitution. Though one would not like to go into a
			<lb />
			detailed analysis of the reasons, I feel that it is not the
			<lb />
			trusteeship that failed, but the frailties of the trustees and
			<lb />
			the collaborators which failed the system. To me, it is a
			<lb />
			curable situation yet.
			<lb />
			There is no healthy system in practice. No doubt, the fault is
			<lb />
			not wholly of the Collegium. The active silence of the
			<lb />
			Executive in not preventing such unworthy appointments
			<lb />
			was actually one of the major problems. The Second and
			<lb />
			Third Judges Case had provided effective tools in the hands
			<lb />
			of the Executive to prevent such aberrations. Whether &apos;Joint
			<lb />
			venture&apos;, as observed by Chelameswar, J., or not, the
			<lb />
			Executive seldom effectively used those tools.
			<lb />
			Therefore, the Collegium system needs to be improved
			<lb />
			requiring a &apos;glasnost&apos; and a &apos;perestroika&apos;, and hence the case
			<lb />
			needs to be heard further in this regard.

			Articles 124, 127, 128, 217, 222, 224 and 231 of the

			Courts (&apos;the Constitutional courts&apos;), and other allied matters.
			<lb />
			The Constitution (Ninety-Ninth Amendment) Act, 2014 (&apos;the

			<lb />
			(&apos;the

			<lb />
			enacted
			<lb />
			simultaneously, purports to regulate the procedure of the
			<lb />
			National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC). The
			<lb />
			present batch of petitions challenge the constitutional validity
			<lb />
			of the Amendment Act and the NJAC Act. . The Supreme Court

			Pre-Amendment Scheme of Appointment and
			<lb />
			Transfer of Judges
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			3.
			<lb />
			The scheme of appointment and transfer of Judges in
			<lb />
			force prior to the amendment is set out in two memoranda
			<lb />
			dated 30 th June, 1999 issued by the Government of India -first
			<lb />
			for appointment of Chief Justice of India (CJI) and judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court and second for appointment and transfer of
			<lb />
			Chief Justices and the judges of the High Courts.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3.1 Broadly the procedure laid down in the first
			<lb />
			memorandum is that appointment to the office of the CJI
			<lb />
			should be of the senior most judge of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			considered fit to hold the office.
			<lb />
			For this purpose,
			<lb />
			recommendation is sought from the outgoing CJI and if there is
			<lb />
			doubt about the fitness of the senior most judge, consultation
			<lb />
			is made with the other judges under Article 124(2).
			<lb />
			Thereafter, the Law Minister puts up the matter to the Prime
			<lb />
			Minister (PM) who advises the President. After approval of the
			<lb />
			President, the appointment is notified. For appointment as
			<lb />
			judges of the Supreme Court, the CJI initiates the proposal and
			<lb />
			forwards his recommendation to the Union Minister of Law who
			<lb />
			puts up the matter to the PM, who in turn advises the
			<lb />
			President. Opinion of the CJI is formed in consultation with four
			<lb />
			senior most judges and if successor CJI is not in the said four
			<lb />
			senior most judges, he is also made part of the collegium. CJI
			<lb />
			also ascertains the views of the senior most judge in the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court who hails from the High Court from where a
			<lb />
			person recommended comes. Opinions in respect of the
			<lb />
			recommendation are in writing and are transmitted to the
			<lb />
			Government of India for record. If the views of non-judges are
			<lb />
			solicited, a memorandum thereof and its substance is
			<lb />
			conveyed to the Government of India. Once appointment is
			<lb />
			approved by the President of India, certificate of physical
			<lb />
			fitness is obtained and after the warrant of appointment is
			<lb />
			signed by the President, the appointment is announced and a
			<lb />
			notification issued in the Gazette of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3.2 The procedure laid down in the second memorandum
			<lb />
			deals with the appointments to the High Courts and transfers.
			<lb />
			The Chief Justices of High Courts are appointed from outside.
			<lb />
			Inter se seniority in a particular High Court is considered for
			<lb />
			appointment as Chief Justice from that High Court. Initiation of
			<lb />
			proposal for appointment of Chief Justice of a High Court is by
			<lb />
			the CJI. The CJI consults two senior most Judges of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court and also ascertains the views of his senior most
			<lb />
			colleague in the Supreme Court who is conversant with the
			<lb />
			affairs of the High Court in which the recommendee has been
			<lb />
			functioning and whose opinion is likely to be significant in
			<lb />
			adjudging the suitability of the candidate. The views of the
			<lb />
			Judges are sent along with the proposal of the Union Minister
			<lb />
			of Law who obtains the views of the concerned State
			<lb />
			Government and then submits the proposal to the PM who
			<lb />
			advises the President. As soon as appointment is approved by
			<lb />
			the President, notification is issued in the Gazette of India. As
			<lb />
			regards the appointment of a Judge of the High Court, the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of the High Court communicates to the Chief
			<lb />
			Minister his views, after consulting two of his senior most
			<lb />
			colleagues regarding suitability of the person to be selected.
			<lb />
			All consultations must be in writing and these opinions are sent
			<lb />
			to the Chief Minister, along with the recommendation. If the
			<lb />
			Chief Minister desires to recommend a name, he has to
			<lb />
			forward the same to the Chief Justice for his consideration. A
			<lb />
			copy of the recommendation is also sent to the CJI and the
			<lb />
			Union Law Minister. The Chief Minister advises the Governor
			<lb />
			who forwards his recommendation to the Law Minister. The
			<lb />
			Law Minister considers the recommendation in the light of such
			<lb />
			other reports (such as I.B. report) as may be available to the
			<lb />
			Government and then forwards the material to the CJI. CJI
			<lb />
			consults two senior most Judges and also takes into account
			<lb />
			the views of the Chief Justice and Judges of the High Court
			<lb />
			(consulted by the Chief Justice) and those Judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court who are conversant with the affairs of the
			<lb />
			candidate. Thereafter the CJI sends the recommendation to
			<lb />
			the Union Law Minister along with the correspondence with his
			<lb />
			colleagues. If the Law Minister considers it expedient to refer
			<lb />
			back the name for opinion of the State Constitutional
			<lb />
			Authorities, opinion of the CJI must be obtained. The Law
			<lb />
			Minister then puts up the recommendation to the PM who
			<lb />
			advises the President. The correspondence between the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice, the Chief Minister and Governor inter se is in writing.
			<lb />
			As soon as the appointment is approved by the President,
			<lb />
			physical fitness is ascertained and as soon as warrant of
			<lb />
			appointment is signed by the President, notification is issued in
			<lb />
			the Gazette of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3.3 Proposal for transfer is initiated by the CJI. Consent of
			<lb />
			the Judge concerned is not necessary. The CJI consults four
			<lb />
			senior most Judges of the Supreme Court and takes into
			<lb />
			account the views of the Chief Justice of the High Court from
			<lb />
			which the Judge is to be transferred and Chief Justice of the
			<lb />
			High Court to which the transfer is to be effected. CJI also
			<lb />
			takes into account the views of one or more Supreme Court
			<lb />
			Judges who are in a position to offer his/their views. The views
			<lb />
			are expressed in writing, and are considered by the CJI and
			<lb />
			four senior most Judges. The personal facts relating to the
			<lb />
			Judge and his response to the proposal are invariably taken
			<lb />
			into account. The proposal is then referred to the Government.
			<lb />
			The Law Minister submits the recommendation to the PM who
			<lb />
			advises the President. After the President approves the
			<lb />
			transfer, a notification is issued in the Official Gazette.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3.4 The above memoranda were issued by the Government
			<lb />
			of India in the light of unamended Constitutional provisions
			<lb />
			and the judgment of this Court dated 28 th October, 1998 in
			<lb />
			Special Reference No.1 of 1998 712 (Third Judges&apos; case)
			<lb />
			Page 919
			<lb />
			which in substance reiterates the earlier Nine Judge Bench
			<lb />
			judgment in SCAORA vs. Union of India 713 (Second
			<lb />
			Judges&apos; case).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3.5 Reference may also be made to the unamended
			<lb />
			constitutional provisions. Article 124 (2) provides that a Judge
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President after
			<lb />
			consultation with such Judges of the Supreme Court and the
			<lb />
			High Courts as are deemed necessary. However, the CJI is
			<lb />
			always to be consulted. Article 217 provides that a Judge of
			<lb />
			the High Court shall be appointed by the President after
			<lb />
			consultation with CJI, Governor of the State and in case of a
			<lb />
			Judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of the High
			<lb />
			Court.
			<lb />
			The question arose before this Court on several
			<lb />
			occasions as to the value of the opinion of the CJI in the
			<lb />
			process of &apos;consultation&apos;.
			<lb />
			This Court held that under the
			<lb />
			scheme of the Constitution a proposal for appointment to the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court must emanate from the CJI and for
			<lb />
			appointment to the High Court it should emanate from the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of the High Court and the last word on
			<lb />
			appointment must rest with the CJI 714 . This Court noted that by
			<lb />
			convention proposals for appointments were always initiated
			<lb />
			by the judiciary and appointments were made with the
			<lb />
			concurrence of the CJI. This view was reiterated in Third
			<lb />
			Judges&apos; case on the basis of which the above memoranda
			<lb />
			were issued by the Government of India.

			<lb />
			Reference may now be made to the impugned
			<lb />
			Amendment. It amends Article 124 and provides that such
			<lb />
			appointments
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			transfers
			<lb />
			will
			<lb />
			now
			<lb />
			be
			<lb />
			on
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			recommendation of the NJAC (Section 2). Requirement of
			<lb />
			mandatory consultation with the CJI and consultation with such
			<lb />
			Judges as may be considered necessary has been deleted.
			<lb />
			Convention of initiation of proposal by Chief Justice for the
			<lb />
			High Courts and CJI for the Supreme Court and other scheme
			<lb />
			as reflected in the memoranda earlier mentioned and as laid
			<lb />
			down in decisions of this Court has been replaced. The
			<lb />
			amendment inserts a new Article 124A, under which the NJAC
			<lb />
			is to be constituted. It will comprise the CJI, two senior most
			<lb />
			judges of Supreme Court next to the CJI, Union Law Minister
			<lb />
			and two eminent persons to be nominated by the Committee
			<lb />
			comprising of the PM, the CJI and the Leader of the Opposition
			<lb />
			in the House of the People/Leader of single largest Opposition
			<lb />
			Party in the House of the People. The nomination of one of
			<lb />
			these eminent persons is reserved for persons belonging to the
			<lb />
			Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes, OBC, minorities or
			<lb />
			women. Under the new scheme, for any proposal five out of
			<lb />
			six members must concur. If any two members disagree, no
			<lb />
			proposal can be made.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			The Amendment Act also provides for the Parliament to
			<lb />
			enact law to regulate the procedure for appointment of judges
			<lb />
			of higher courts and to empower the Commission to lay down,
			<lb />
			by regulations, the procedure for discharge of its functions, the
			<lb />
			manner of selection of its members and such other matters, as
			<lb />
			may be considered necessary (Section 3).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			The NJAC Act provides for the appointment of the senior
			<lb />
			most judge of the Supreme Court as CJI, if considered fit to
			<lb />
			hold the office; and for recommendation for appointment as
			<lb />
			judge of the Supreme Court (Section 5). The Second proviso to
			<lb />
			Section 5(2) of the NJAC Act states that the Commission shall
			<lb />
			not recommend a person if two members of the Commission
			<lb />
			do not agree. Apart from its other functions, the Commission
			<lb />
			would also recommend appointments of Chief Justice and
			<lb />
			judges of High Courts (Section 6(1), (3)). Alternatively, the
			<lb />
			Commission can seek a nomination from the Chief Justice of
			<lb />
			the High Court for recommending appointment as judge of the
			<lb />
			High Court(Section 6(2)). For appointment of judges of High
			<lb />
			Courts, however, the Commission must seek prior consultation
			<lb />
			with the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court, who in turn
			<lb />
			has to consult two senior most judges of the said High Court
			<lb />
			and such other judges and eminent advocates as may be
			<lb />
			specified. (Section 6(4)). The Commission is also to seek views
			<lb />
			of the Governor and Chief Minister of the concerned State. The
			<lb />
			power of appointment of officers and employees of the
			<lb />
			Commission is with the Central Government. The Convener of
			<lb />
			the Commission is the Secretary, Government of India, in the
			<lb />
			Department of Justice. Central Government is authorised to
			<lb />
			make rules for carrying out the provisions of the Act(section
			<lb />
			11).
			<lb />
			The Commission is authorised to make regulations
			<lb />
			consistent with the Act and the Rules. The Rules and the
			<lb />
			Regulations framed under the Act are required to be placed
			<lb />
			before the Parliament, which may modify such rules or
			<lb />
			regulations(sections 12, 13).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>

			<lb />
			The statement of objects and reasons of the amendment
			<lb />
			mentions that this Court had interpreted the word
			<lb />
			&quot;consultation&quot; as &quot;concurrence&quot; in Articles 124(2) and 217 (2)
			<lb />
			of the Constitution (S.2). It further states that after review of
			<lb />
			the constitutional provisions, pronouncements of this Court
			<lb />
			and consultation with eminent jurists, it was felt that a broad
			<lb />
			based National Judicial Appointments Commission should be
			<lb />
			established for making recommendation for appointment of
			<lb />
			judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts. The
			<lb />
			Commission will provide meaningful role to the judiciary, the
			<lb />
			executive and eminent persons to present their view points
			<lb />
			and make the participants accountable while also introducing
			<lb />
			transparency in the selection process (S.3).
			<lb />

		<p>
			7.1 Though by notification dated 13 th April, 2015, the
			<lb />
			Amendment and the Act have been brought into force, the
			<lb />
			Commission has not been constituted so far, as two eminent
			<lb />
			persons have not been so far appointed.

			8.
			<lb />
			The Amendment Act is challenged as ultra vires, inter
			<lb />
			alia for being beyond the competence of the Parliament as it
			<lb />
			alters and destroys the basic structure of the Constitution, as
			<lb />
			embodied in the independence of judiciary in the context of
			<lb />
			appointment of judges of the higher judiciary. The petitioners
			<lb />
			submit that the power of the Parliament to amend the
			<lb />
			Constitution under Article 368 is limited and does not extend
			<lb />
			to altering or destroying the basic structure or basic features of
			<lb />
			the Constitution. The independence of the judiciary is a
			<lb />
			constitutional concept, regarded as a basic feature of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, and includes insulating the judiciary from
			<lb />
			executive or legislative control, primacy of higher judiciary in
			<lb />
			the matter of appointment of judges to the High Courts and
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court, non-amendability of conditions of service
			<lb />
			of judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court to their
			<lb />
			disadvantage. The Amendment takes away the primacy of the
			<lb />
			collective opinion of the CJI and the senior most Supreme Court
			<lb />
			judges by stalling an appointment unanimously proposed by
			<lb />
			them if the same is not concurred by two non-judge
			<lb />
			Commission members [second proviso to Section 5(2) and
			<lb />
			Section 6(6)].
			<lb />
			This endows unchecked veto power to
			<lb />
			non-judges
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			appointing
			<lb />
			judges
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			higher
			<lb />
			courts,
			<lb />
			compromising the judiciary&apos;s independence. The Amendment
			<lb />
			also dilutes the judiciary&apos;s constitutionally-conferred power by
			<lb />
			granting unbridled power on the Parliament to control, by
			<lb />
			ordinary law, the manner of selection of a person for
			<lb />
			appointment to higher judiciary, which also damages the
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary. This power enables the Parliament
			<lb />
			to substitute judiciary&apos;s primacy with that of the executive. If
			<lb />
			allowed to stand, the provision could easily be further
			<lb />
			amended thereby denying any effective role for the senior
			<lb />
			most judges of the higher judiciary in appointment of judges of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court and the High Courts.
			<lb />
			Thus, the
			<lb />
			Amendment does not envisage predominant voice for the
			<lb />
			judges and makes the executive element in appointment of
			<lb />
			judges dominant which alters and damages the basic structure
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. It is also contended that the NJAC Act was
			<lb />
			void as it was passed by the Parliament before the Amendment
			<lb />
			Act became operative.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			Thus, the contentions on behalf of the petitioners are:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Constitution is supreme and powers of all
			<lb />
			organs
			<lb />
			are
			<lb />
			defined
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			controlled
			<lb />
			thereunder;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			Amending power of Parliament is limited by
			<lb />
			the concept of basic structure as judicially
			<lb />
			interpreted;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii) Final interpreter of the Constitution and the
			<lb />
			scope of powers thereunder is this Court;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iv) Independence of judiciary and separation of
			<lb />
			powers are part of basic structure;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(v) Primacy of judiciary in appointment of
			<lb />
			judges is crucial part of independence of
			<lb />
			judiciary and separation of powers and thus
			<lb />
			part of basic structure;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(vi) Role of executive and legislature in
			<lb />
			appointment of judges being kept at
			<lb />
			minimum was also part of basic structure;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(vii) The composition of the Commission in the
			<lb />
			impugned Amendment severally damages
			<lb />
			the basic structure of the Constitution by
			<lb />
			destroying
			<lb />
			primacy
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			judiciary
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			appointment
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			judges
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			giving
			<lb />
			controlling role to the executive and
			<lb />
			legislature in such appointments;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(viii) The impugned amendment enables stalling
			<lb />
			of appointment of judges proposed by the
			<lb />
			judiciary unless candidates suggested by
			<lb />
			the executive are appointed thereby
			<lb />
			compromising independence of judiciary;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ix) The impugned amendment expands the
			<lb />
			power of amendment by delegating crucial
			<lb />
			issues of appointment of judges to
			<lb />
			Parliament which is against the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Constitution;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(x) The composition of the Commission will
			<lb />
			shake confidence of people in Judiciary if
			<lb />
			Executive or Legislature have dominant
			<lb />
			voice; and
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(xi) The impugned Act is beyond legislative
			<lb />
			competence of the Parliament.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			10. The Joint Secretary, Department of Justice has filed a
			<lb />
			counter affidavit on behalf of the Union of India (UOI),
			<lb />
			defending the Amendment and the Act. UOI&apos;s case is that
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary is only post appointment.
			<lb />
			Appointment is an executive act and the judiciary&apos;s
			<lb />
			independence has no relevance with the executive act of
			<lb />
			appointment. UOI submits that judicial independence is to be
			<lb />
			coupled with checks and balances and that a contextual
			<lb />
			reading of Articles 124(2) and 217(1) with the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly Debates (CAD) makes it evident that there is no
			<lb />
			primacy of the CJI in appointment of judges. Consultation with
			<lb />
			the CJI was only by way of a check on executive, which had the
			<lb />
			final say in the matter. Further, provision for consultation with
			<lb />
			other judges does not justify creation of a collegium. UOI&apos;s
			<lb />
			submission refers to impeachment provisions for removal of
			<lb />
			judges (Article 124(4); Parliament&apos;s power to regulate
			<lb />
			procedure for presentation of an address and investigation and
			<lb />
			proof of misbehaviour or incapacity of a judge (Article 124(5))
			<lb />
			and to determine salary of judges and provisions pertaining to
			<lb />
			other aspects of judicial functioning conferring power on
			<lb />
			Parliament to legislate (Article 125). UOI submits that the
			<lb />
			decisions of this Court in Second Judges&apos; case and Third
			<lb />
			Judges&apos; case laying down primacy of the judiciary in the
			<lb />
			context of consultative process under Articles 124(1) and
			<lb />
			217(1) have no relevance to test the validity of the impugned
			<lb />
			Ninety Ninth Amendment by which provisions of Articles
			<lb />
			124(2) and 217(1) stand amended. However, it is contended
			<lb />
			that the view taken in the said judgments that the judiciary
			<lb />
			has primacy in appointment is erroneous, and needs to be
			<lb />
			revisited. In any case, the UOI contends that the primacy of
			<lb />
			judiciary in the matter of appointment of judges of the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary has no connection with independence of judiciary and
			<lb />
			is not the basic feature of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			In several
			<lb />
			countries, such as Australia, independence of judiciary exists
			<lb />
			without primacy of the judiciary in appointments of judges to
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary. UOI submits that the power conferred on
			<lb />
			Parliament to enact law to regulate the procedure of the NJAC
			<lb />
			or to modify the regulations framed by the NJAC is valid. The
			<lb />
			NJAC is accountable to Parliament in framing regulations. The
			<lb />
			presence of Law Minister as a member of the NJAC ensures
			<lb />
			accountability to public. The presence of two eminent persons
			<lb />
			is a check and balance on the functioning of other members.
			<lb />
			Diversity of members will ensure greater accountability of each
			<lb />
			member to the other.
			<lb />
			This will ensure greater public
			<lb />
			confidence in the functioning of the judiciary. The NJAC will fall
			<lb />
			under the purview of Right to Information Act, 2005 which will
			<lb />
			ensure transparency. Even if the Amendment was struck
			<lb />
			down, original provisions could not be revived as doctrine of
			<lb />
			revival does not apply to Constitutional Amendments. The
			<lb />
			issue was raised in Property Owners&apos; Association vs.
			<lb />
			State of Maharashtra 715 with respect to Article 31C of the
			<lb />
			Constitution which is pending before a nine-judge Bench. It is
			<lb />
			also submitted that the writ petition is pre-mature as the new
			<lb />
			system has not been given a chance to operate and no rights
			<lb />
			have been affected.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			11.
			<lb />
			The contentions on behalf of the respondents can be
			<lb />
			summed up as follows:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(a) Power of appointment of judges rests with
			<lb />
			the executive and role of judiciary is
			<lb />
			confined to consultation which may or may
			<lb />
			not be accepted by the executive;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(b) Primacy of judiciary in appointments was
			<lb />
			recognised by erroneous interpretation of
			<lb />
			unamended provisions of the Constitution
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			by
			<lb />
			way
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			amendment
			<lb />
			such
			<lb />
			interpretation has been corrected and thus
			<lb />
			there is no violation of basic structure.
			<lb />
			Alternatively larger Bench be constituted to
			<lb />
			correct the earlier interpretation;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(c) Primacy of judiciary in appointments was
			<lb />
			not inalienable and in changed situation, in
			<lb />
			the light of experiences gained, the
			<lb />
			primacy could be done away with or
			<lb />
			modified;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(d) Wisdom of constituent body in making a
			<lb />
			choice was not open to judicial review;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(e) Taking the Constitution as a whole, value of
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary could be
			<lb />
			balanced with other constitutional values of
			<lb />
			democracy, accountability and checks and
			<lb />
			balances;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(f)
			<lb />
			Power of amendment was plenary and
			<lb />
			could not be questioned unless it results in
			<lb />
			destruction of a pillar of Constitution;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(g) Even with power being with executive or
			<lb />
			power of veto being with executive,
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary could survive so
			<lb />
			long as there was protection of tenure and
			<lb />
			service conditions of judges;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(h) Accountability
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			transparency
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			functioning of every constitutional organ
			<lb />
			was part of democracy in which case
			<lb />
			exclusive power of appointment of judges
			<lb />
			with the judiciary was undemocratic;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The impugned amendment retains primacy
			<lb />
			by having three out of six members, out of
			<lb />
			which two could stop an undesirable
			<lb />
			appointment. The executive did not have
			<lb />
			predominant role as two eminent persons
			<lb />
			were appointed by a committee having the
			<lb />
			Prime Minister, the CJI and the Leader of
			<lb />
			Opposition thereby role of Prime Minister
			<lb />
			being limited. Law Minister and eminent
			<lb />
			persons as members ensured giving of
			<lb />
			relevant
			<lb />
			feedback
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			ensuring
			<lb />
			accountability and transparency.;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(j)
			<lb />
			The impugned amendment in conferring
			<lb />
			power on Parliament and the Central
			<lb />
			Government in procedural matters did not
			<lb />
			violate independence of judiciary; and
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(k)
			<lb />
			The impugned Act was within legislative
			<lb />
			competence of Parliament.

			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;3 Looking at the scheme of the 99 th
			<lb />
			Amendment
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			National
			<lb />
			Judicial
			<lb />
			Commission Appointments Act, 2014 (NJAC
			<lb />
			Act), the scheme evolved provides for the
			<lb />
			constitution of a 6 member Commission and
			<lb />
			under Article 124-C, for the procedure to be
			<lb />
			provided under a law made by the Parliament.
			<lb />
			The NJAC Act has certain salient features that
			<lb />
			includes under the second proviso to Section
			<lb />
			5(2), a provision in the nature of a &apos;veto&apos;, as no
			<lb />
			appointment can be made if two members of
			<lb />
			the Commission do not agree to that
			<lb />
			appointment. This provision is challenged by
			<lb />
			the Petitioners as the 99 th Amendment Act does
			<lb />
			not make any such provision and to provide for
			<lb />
			a &apos;veto&apos;, as it were, by two out of six members,
			<lb />
			is stated to be ultra vires the Amendment Act
			<lb />
			or, in any event, not a matter of procedure.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			4 This submission appears to be correct for
			<lb />
			the following reasons:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			a. The principle of &apos;primacy&apos; of the
			<lb />
			judiciary, which is a part of judicial
			<lb />
			independence, must necessarily be read
			<lb />
			into the NJAC Act as well.
			<lb />
			Any Act
			<lb />
			providing for procedure would be ultra
			<lb />
			vires the Constitutional provision if it
			<lb />
			does not satisfy the requirement of
			<lb />
			primacy. The &apos;veto&apos; provision, therefore,
			<lb />
			is clearly antithetical to the concept of
			<lb />
			&apos;primacy&apos; and must be struck down as
			<lb />
			being ultra vires the amendment.

			6. Irrespective of the nine Judges&apos; Bench
			<lb />
			judgment, certain concepts in law exist in the
			<lb />
			matter of the functioning of the judiciary in a
			<lb />
			democracy. The existence of an independent
			<lb />
			judiciary is a sine qua non for democracy to
			<lb />
			flourish. Here, we are concerned with the issue
			<lb />
			of appointment of judges to the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary. Whether, the power is executive or
			<lb />
			not, it cannot be gainsaid that it impinges on
			<lb />
			the independence of the judiciary in case the
			<lb />
			executive were to exclusively have the power
			<lb />
			to appoint the judges.
			<lb />
			Such a system of
			<lb />
			appointment could result in brining into
			<lb />
			existence judges who are subservient to the
			<lb />
			will of the Government, which would be a major
			<lb />
			litigant in the Courts. Independence therefore,
			<lb />
			would stand affected.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			7. If the &apos;veto&apos; is invalid, then the common
			<lb />
			law principle of majority would apply. The Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India and the two other judges have
			<lb />
			expertise in the matter of selection of judges to
			<lb />
			the higher judiciary and also have full
			<lb />
			knowledge of the functioning of the potential
			<lb />
			candidates. However, the unanimous view of
			<lb />
			the three judges would not carry the day if
			<lb />
			opposed by the other three members. In every
			<lb />
			other case, where all six are in agreement on a
			<lb />
			candidate, no problem in making the right
			<lb />
			decision would arise.
			<lb />
			The real question,
			<lb />
			therefore, is what would be the position if a
			<lb />
			deadlock arises when the unanimous decision
			<lb />
			of the three judges is opposed by the other
			<lb />
			three members. Needless to state, that if the
			<lb />
			three judges are not ad idem on a candidate,
			<lb />
			no &apos;issue of primacy&apos; would arise and the
			<lb />
			majority would prevail.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			8. It is true that the nine judges case can no
			<lb />
			more hold the field for the purpose of nullifying
			<lb />
			the 99 th amendment, which, obviously, is
			<lb />
			inconsistent with the Collegium system evolved
			<lb />
			by the nine judges judgment. But that does not
			<lb />
			mean that the principles enunciated by the said
			<lb />
			judgment could not be relied upon as being a
			<lb />
			juristic principle that would be applicable in
			<lb />
			such cases. In other words, these principles
			<lb />
			can be said to be relevant for all time to come
			<lb />
			because of the following reasons :
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			a. The power of appointment can be used
			<lb />
			to affect or subvert the independence of
			<lb />
			the appointees when functioning as
			<lb />
			members of the superior judiciary.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			b. A system of appointment where the
			<lb />
			executive voice predominates would
			<lb />
			affect such independence.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			c. If however, the voice of the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			of India, representing the judiciary
			<lb />
			prevails, even in a system where the
			<lb />
			executive or anyone else has a minor
			<lb />
			part to play, this will nevertheless not
			<lb />
			affect the independence and on the
			<lb />
			other
			<lb />
			hand
			<lb />
			would
			<lb />
			sub-serve
			<lb />
			independence. In other words, primacy
			<lb />
			in the matter of appointment has to be
			<lb />
			with the judiciary.

			11. These are general principles enunciated by
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court based on the concept of
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary. That concept is
			<lb />
			all pervasive and whenever that situation
			<lb />
			arises, the Court would, in the same manner as
			<lb />
			it did in the Second Judges&apos; case , interpret
			<lb />
			the present Article 124-A. This would mean
			<lb />
			that the principle of independence underlying
			<lb />
			the appointment of judges of the higher
			<lb />
			judiciary would require that the views of the
			<lb />
			three judges of the Commission, speaking with
			<lb />
			a single voice would have primacy. This would
			<lb />
			be the result not because the judgment in the
			<lb />
			Second Judges&apos; case would bind the Court
			<lb />
			but
			<lb />
			because
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			concept
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			judicial
			<lb />
			independence applicable in the case of
			<lb />
			appointment of judges to the higher judiciary
			<lb />
			would be applicable wherever and whenever a
			<lb />
			situation arose where no explicit provision in
			<lb />
			the Constitution gave primacy to the judicial
			<lb />
			wing.
			<lb />
			In such cases, the validity of the
			<lb />
			constitutional provision would be upheld and
			<lb />
			legitimized exactly on the same basis as the
			<lb />
			concept was evolved in the Second Judges&apos;
			<lb />
			case. As a result, the 99 th amendment to the
			<lb />
			Constitution, would always be deemed to have
			<lb />
			been a valid exercise of Constituent power. In
			<lb />
			the absence of the existence of a &apos;veto&apos;, if the
			<lb />
			three Judges speak with a single voice, their
			<lb />
			decision would prevail. The President would
			<lb />
			then have to issue the warrant of appointment.

			16. Apart from the above, petitioners have also
			<lb />
			contended that the term &apos;eminent person&apos; is
			<lb />
			too broad and that the appointment of eminent
			<lb />
			persons who have nothing to do with the law
			<lb />
			and who are not aware of the working of the
			<lb />
			judicial system would result in a violation of the
			<lb />
			principle of judicial independence. &apos;The rule of
			<lb />
			purposive interpretation&apos; can be applied to this
			<lb />
			provision. By application of this rule, the Court
			<lb />
			can interpret eminent persons to mean only
			<lb />
			&apos;persons trained in law&apos; or &apos;eminent jurists&apos; (see
			<lb />
			in this regard, P. Vaikunta Shenoy v. P. Hari
			<lb />
			Sharma (2007) 14 SCC 297 @ Paras 11-13 and

			The Issue
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			14. There being no dispute that a Constitutional Amendment
			<lb />
			can be valid only if it is consistent with the basic structure of
			<lb />
			the Constitution, the core issue for consideration is whether
			<lb />
			the impugned amendment alters or damages the said basic
			<lb />
			structure and is void on that ground.
			<lb />
			According to the
			<lb />
			petitioners the primacy of judiciary in appointment of judges
			<lb />
			and absence of interference by the Executive therein is by
			<lb />
			itself a part of basic feature of the Constitution being integral
			<lb />
			part of independence of judiciary and separation of judiciary
			<lb />
			from the Executive. According to the respondents primacy of
			<lb />
			judiciary in appointment of judges is not part of independence
			<lb />
			of judiciary. Even when appointments are made by Executive,
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary is not affected. Alternatively in the
			<lb />
			amended scheme, primacy of judiciary is retained and
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary is strengthened. The amendment
			<lb />
			promotes transparency and accountability and is a part of
			<lb />
			needed reform without affecting the basic structure of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. To determine the question one has to look at the
			<lb />
			concept of basic feature which controls the amending power of
			<lb />
			the Parliament. This understanding will lead to the decision
			<lb />
			whether primacy of judiciary and absence of Executive
			<lb />
			interference in appointment of judges is part of such basic
			<lb />
			structure.

			<lb />
			Concept of Basic Features -As Limitation on Power
			<lb />
			of the
			<lb />
			Parliament to amend the Constitution
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			15. Article 368 of the Constitution provides for power to
			<lb />
			amend the Constitution and procedure therefor.
			<lb />
			In
			<lb />
			Kesavananda Bharti vs. State of Kerala 716 (Kesavananda
			<lb />
			Bharti case), the scope of amending power was gone into by
			<lb />
			a bench of 13-Judges. In the concluding para signed by
			<lb />
			9-Judges it was held that &quot;Article 368 does not enable
			<lb />
			Parliament to alter the basic structure or framework of the
			<lb />
			Constitution&quot;. The conclusion was based on interpretation of
			<lb />
			the word &apos;amendment&apos;. It was observed that the word was
			<lb />
			capable of wide as well as narrow meaning and while wide
			<lb />
			meaning was to be preferred but consistent with the intention
			<lb />
			of Constitution makers and the context. It could not be given
			<lb />
			too wide meaning so as to permit damage to the constitutional
			<lb />
			values which depict the identity of the Constitution. 717
			<lb />
			15.1 The basic structure or framework was not exhaustively
			<lb />
			defined but some of the features of the Constitution were held
			<lb />
			to be the illustrations of the basic structure by the majority of
			<lb />
			seven Judges -Sikri CJ, Shelat, Grover, Hegde, Mukherjea,
			<lb />
			Reddy and Khanna, JJ. Illustrations by them include Supremacy
			<lb />
			of the Constitution, democratic form of Government, secular
			<lb />
			character of the Constitution, separation of powers between
			<lb />
			the Judiciary, the Executive and the Legislature, federal
			<lb />
			character of the Constitution, dignity of the individual secured
			<lb />
			by basic rights in accordance with Parts III and IV, unity and
			<lb />
			integrity of the nation. 718
			<lb />
			15.2 It was held that the power of the Parliament to amend
			<lb />
			the Constitution was limited by the requirement that basic
			<lb />
			foundation and structure of the Constitution remains the same.
			<lb />
			Power of amendment was envisaged to meet the challenge of
			<lb />
			the problems which may arise in the course of socio economic
			<lb />
			progress of the country but it was never contemplated that in
			<lb />
			exercise of the power of amendment certain inalienable
			<lb />
			features of the Constitution will be changed.
			<lb />
			The court
			<lb />
			referred to various decisions in different jurisdictions dealing
			<lb />
			with the scope of amendment of the Constitution. Sikri, CJ.
			<lb />
			observed that having regard to importance of freedom of the
			<lb />
			individual and the importance of economic, social and political
			<lb />
			justice, mentioned in the preamble the word &quot;amendment&quot;
			<lb />
			could not be read in its widest sense. The Fundamental Rights
			<lb />
			could not be amended out of existence. Fundamental features
			<lb />
			of secularism, democracy and freedom of individual should
			<lb />
			always subsist. The expression &quot;amendment&quot; had a limited
			<lb />
			meaning. Otherwise a political party with two-third majority
			<lb />
			could so amend the Constitution as to debar any other party
			<lb />
			from functioning, establish totalitarianism and enslave the
			<lb />
			people and thereafter make the Constitution unamendable.
			<lb />
			Thus, the appeal to democratic principles to justify absolute
			<lb />
			amending power, if accepted, could damage the very
			<lb />
			democratic principles. Thus, the amendment meant addition
			<lb />
			or change within the broad contours of the preamble of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. The Parliament could adjust the Fundamental
			<lb />
			Rights to secure the objectives of the Directive Principles while
			<lb />
			maintaining freedom and dignity of every citizen. The dignity
			<lb />
			and freedom of the individual was held to be of supreme
			<lb />
			importance. The basic features were held to be discernible not
			<lb />
			only from the preamble but the whole scheme of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
			Shelat &amp; Grover, JJ. observed that the
			<lb />
			Constitution makers did not desire that the citizens will not
			<lb />
			enjoy the basic freedoms, equality, freedom of religion etc. so
			<lb />
			that dignity of an individual is maintained. The economic and
			<lb />
			social changes were to be made without taking away dignity of
			<lb />
			the individual. The vital provisions of Part III or Part IV could
			<lb />
			not be cut out or denuded of their identity. Hegde and
			<lb />
			Mukherjea, JJ. observed that the power of amendment was
			<lb />
			conferred on the Parliament.
			<lb />
			People as such were not
			<lb />
			associated with the amendment. The Constitution was given
			<lb />
			by the people to themselves. The voice of the members of the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly was of the voice of the people.
			<lb />
			Two-third members of the two Houses of Parliament did not
			<lb />
			necessarily represent even the majority of the people. Thus,
			<lb />
			the two-third members of the two Houses of Parliament could
			<lb />
			not speak on behalf of the entire people of the country 719 .
			<lb />
			Even best of the Government was not averse to have more and
			<lb />
			more powers to carry out their plans and programmes which
			<lb />
			they believe to be in public interest, but freedom once lost
			<lb />
			could hardly be regained. Every encroachment of freedom
			<lb />
			sets a pattern for further encroachment. The development
			<lb />
			was envisaged without destruction of individual freedoms.
			<lb />
			Reddy, J. observed if any of the essential features was altered,
			<lb />
			the Constitutional structure could not maintain its identity.
			<lb />
			There could be no justice, liberty or equality without
			<lb />
			democracy. There could be no democracy without justice,
			<lb />
			equality and liberty. The structure of the Constitution was an
			<lb />
			organic instrument. The core commitment to social revolution
			<lb />
			lies in Parts III and IV. They are the conscience of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
			They had roots deep in the struggle for
			<lb />
			independence. They were included with the hope that one day
			<lb />
			victory of people would bloom in India. They connect India&apos;s
			<lb />
			future, present and past. The demand for Fundamental Rights
			<lb />
			had its inspiration in Magna Carta, the English Bill of Rights,
			<lb />
			the French Revolution, the American Bill of Rights incorporated
			<lb />
			in the US Constitution. Referring to the statement of Dr.
			<lb />
			Ambedkar, that Article 32 was the soul of the Constitution and
			<lb />
			the very heart of it, it was observed that such an article could
			<lb />
			not be abrogated by an amendment. Khanna, J. observed that
			<lb />
			as a result of amendment, the old Constitution could not be
			<lb />
			done away with.
			<lb />
			Basic structure of framework must be
			<lb />
			retained. It was not permissible to touch the foundation or to
			<lb />
			alter the basic institutional pattern. What can be amended is
			<lb />
			the existing Constitution and what must emerge as a result of
			<lb />
			amendment is not a new and different Constitution but the
			<lb />
			existing Constitution. What was contemplated by amendment
			<lb />
			was varying of the Constitution here and there and not
			<lb />
			elimination of its basic structure resulting in losing its identity.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			15.3 One of the questions considered was validity of Section 3
			<lb />
			of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment Act, 1971 adding Article 31-C
			<lb />
			as follows:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;416. Section 3 of the twenty-fifth amendment,
			<lb />
			reads thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3. After Article 31B of the Constitution, the
			<lb />
			following article shall be inserted, namely:
			<lb />
			31. C. Notwithstanding anything contained in
			<lb />
			Article 13, no law giving effect to the policy of
			<lb />
			the State towards securing the principles
			<lb />
			specified in Clause (b) or Clause (c) of Article
			<lb />
			39 shall be deemed to be void on the ground
			<lb />
			that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or
			<lb />
			abridges any of the rights conferred by Article
			<lb />
			14, Article 19 or Article 31; and no law
			<lb />
			containing a declaration that it is for giving
			<lb />
			effect to such policy shall be called in
			<lb />
			question in any court on the ground that it
			<lb />
			does not give effect to such policy:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Provided that where such law is made by the
			<lb />
			legislature of a State, the provisions of this article
			<lb />
			shall not apply thereto unless such law, having
			<lb />
			been reserved for the consideration of the
			<lb />
			President, has received his assent.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The highlighted part was held by majority to be
			<lb />
			unconstitutional, for granting immunity from challenge thereby
			<lb />
			affecting the basic feature of judicial review 720 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			15.4 The scope of amending power was again considered by
			<lb />
			this Court in the course of challenge to Thirty-Ninth
			<lb />
			Amendment which debarred any challenge to the election of
			<lb />
			PM and Speaker of the Lok Sabha in Indira Nehru Gandhi vs.
			<lb />
			Raj Narain 721 .
			<lb />
			Chandrachud, J. (later the Chief Justice)
			<lb />
			observed that it is not that only certain named features of the
			<lb />
			Constitution are part of its basic structure. The features
			<lb />
			named by individual judges in Kesavananda Bharti case
			<lb />
			720 Para 1535 A. (Khanna, J.) In my opinion, the second part of Article 31-C is liable to be quashed
			<lb />
			on the following grounds:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(1) It gives a carte blanche to the Legislature to make any law violative of
			<lb />
			Articles 14, 19 and 31 and make it immune from attack by inserting the requisite declaration.
			<lb />
			Article 31-C taken along with its second part gives in effect the power to the Legislature, including a
			<lb />
			State Legislature, to amend the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(2) The Legislature has been made the final authority to decide as to whether the law made by it
			<lb />
			is for the objects mentioned in Article 31-C. The vice of second part of Article 31-C lies in the fact that
			<lb />
			even if the law enacted is not for the object mentioned in Article 31-C, the declaration made by the
			<lb />
			Legislature precludes a party from showing that the law is not for that object and prevents a court from
			<lb />
			going into the question as to whether the law enacted is really for that object. The exclusion by the
			<lb />
			Legislature, including a State Legislature, of even that limited judicial review strikes at the basic structure
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. The second part of Article 31-C goes beyond the permissible limit of what constitutes
			<lb />
			amendment under Article 368.
			<lb />
			The second part of Article 31-C can be severed from the remaining part of Article 31-C and its
			<lb />
			invalidity would not affect the validity of the remaining part. I would, therefore, strike down the
			<lb />
			following words in Article 31-C:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in
			<lb />
			question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy.&quot;

			exhaustive. Having regard to its place in the scheme of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, its object and purpose and the consequences of
			<lb />
			its denial on the integrity of the Constitution, a feature of the
			<lb />
			Constitution could be held to be a basic feature 722 . He added
			<lb />
			that undoubted unamendable basic features are :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;(i) India is a Sovereign Democratic Republic; (ii)
			<lb />
			Equality of status and opportunity shall be secured
			<lb />
			to all its citizens; (iii) The State shall have no
			<lb />
			religion of its own and all persons shall be equally
			<lb />
			entitled to freedom of conscience and the right
			<lb />
			freely to profess, practise and propagate religion
			<lb />
			and that (iv) the Nation shall be governed by a
			<lb />
			Government of laws not of men&quot;.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			39 th Amendment debarring challenge to election inter alia of
			<lb />
			PM was struck down as being against the basic features of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. 723 Article 329A, Clause (4) (added by way of
			<lb />
			Amendment) provided that election law will not apply to a
			<lb />
			person holding office of PM and Speaker and election of such
			<lb />
			persons shall not be deemed to be void under any such law. It
			<lb />
			was held that the democracy was the part of the basic
			<lb />
			structure which contemplated free and fair election. Without
			<lb />
			there being machinery for resolving an election dispute, the
			<lb />
			722 Para 663 -For determining whether a particular feature of the Constitution is a part of its basic structure,
			<lb />
			one has perforce to examine in each individual case the place of the particular feature in the scheme of our
			<lb />
			Constitution, its object and purpose, and the consequences of its denial on the integrity of the Constitution
			<lb />
			as a fundamental instrument of country&apos;s governance. But it is needless for the purpose of these appeals to
			<lb />
			ransack every nook and cranny of the Constitution to discover the bricks of the basic structure. Those that
			<lb />
			are enumerated in the majority judgments are massive enough to cover the requirements of Shri Shanti
			<lb />
			Bhushan&apos;s challenge.

			723 Khanna and Mathew, JJ held that free and fair election was essential for democracy and was part of

			<lb />
			elections could not be free and fair which in turn will damage
			<lb />
			the basic feature of democracy. In absence of any law to deal
			<lb />
			with validity of election of PM, the basic feature of rule of law
			<lb />
			will be violated. Referring to the writing of Madison in &quot;The
			<lb />
			Federalist&quot;, it was observed that all powers of the Government
			<lb />
			could not be vested in one Department. No Constitution could
			<lb />
			survive without adherence to checks and balances. &quot;Just as
			<lb />
			courts ought not to enter into problems entwined in the
			<lb />
			&quot;political thicket&quot;, Parliament must also respect the preserve
			<lb />
			of the courts 724 .&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			15.5. Validity of Forty-Second Amendment was considered by
			<lb />
			this Court in Minerva Mills Ltd. vs. Union of India 725 . The
			<lb />
			court considered the validity of Sections 4 and 55 of the 42 nd
			<lb />
			Amendment Act. By Section 4, Article 31C was sought to be
			<lb />
			amended to provide that a law giving effect to Part IV of the
			<lb />
			Constitution could not be deemed to be void for being
			<lb />
			inconsistent with Articles 14, 19 and 31 and could not be
			<lb />
			challenged on the ground that the said law was not for giving
			<lb />
			effect to the said Part IV. By Section 55, it was provided that
			<lb />
			no amendment of the Constitution could be challenged on any
			<lb />
			ground and that there will be no limitation on the constituent
			<lb />
			power of Parliament to amend the Constitution. This Court
			<lb />
			observed that the Constitution had conferred limited amending
			<lb />
			power on the Parliament which itself was a basic feature of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. The Parliament could not expand its amending
			<lb />
			power so as to destroy the said basic feature of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. The limited power could not be converted into
			<lb />
			unlimited one. Clauses 4 and 5 of Article 368 added by
			<lb />
			Forty-Second Amendment were struck down as violative of
			<lb />
			basic structure of the Constitution. It was observed that the
			<lb />
			balance between Part III and Part IV of the Constitution was
			<lb />
			basic feature of the Constitution 726 . Limited amending power
			<lb />
			of Parliament was also part of basic structure. 727 It was also
			<lb />
			held that judicial review to determine whether a law was to
			<lb />
			give effect to Part IV could not be excluded as judicial review
			<lb />
			was part of the basic structure. 728 It was also observed that
			<lb />
			though there is no rigid separation of powers in three
			<lb />
			departments of the State -the Executive, the Legislature and
			<lb />
			the Judiciary, there is broad demarcation.
			<lb />
			Fine balance
			<lb />
			between the three organs could not be upset as it will destroy
			<lb />
			the fundamental premise of a democratic government. The
			<lb />
			judiciary is entrusted with the duty to keep the Executive and
			<lb />
			the Legislature within the limits of power conferred on them
			<lb />
			which is also a basic feature of the Constitution. 729

			<lb />
			Article 323 -A(2)(d) and 323 -B (3)(d) to the extent it
			<lb />
			excluded the jurisdiction of High Courts in respect of specified
			<lb />
			matters for which jurisdiction was conferred on Tribunals was
			<lb />
			struck down as violative of basic structure. Power of judicial
			<lb />
			review conferred on this Court and the High Courts was held to
			<lb />
			be integral to constitutional scheme in view of earlier decisions
			<lb />
			and conferment of power of judicial review on another judicial
			<lb />
			body could not justify exclusion of jurisdiction of the High
			<lb />
			Courts. 731
			<lb />
			15.7. In I.R. Coelho vs. State of Tamil Nadu 732 , bench of
			<lb />
			nine Judges, considered the scope of judicial review of
			<lb />
			inclusion of a law in Ninth Schedule by a constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment thereby giving immunity from challenge in view of
			<lb />
			Article 31B of the Constitution. It was held that every such
			<lb />
			amendment shall have to be tested on the touchstone of
			<lb />
			essential features of the Constitution which included those
			<lb />
			reflected in Articles 14, 19 and 21 and principles underlying
			<lb />
			them. Such amendments are not immune from the attack on
			<lb />
			the ground they destroy or damage the basic structure. The
			<lb />
			Court will apply the &apos;rights test&apos; and the &apos;essence of the rights&apos;
			<lb />
			test
			<lb />
			taking synoptic view of Articles in Part III of the
			<lb />
			(1997) 3 SCC 261
			<lb />
			Judicial review by constitutional courts was held to be part of basic structure. (Paras 77, 78)
			<lb />
			(2007) 2 SCC 1
			<lb />
			Constitution. It was further observed that the Court has to be
			<lb />
			guided by the &apos;impact test&apos; in determining whether a basic
			<lb />
			feature was violated. The Court will first determine if there is
			<lb />
			violation of rights in Part III by impugned Amendment, its
			<lb />
			impact on the basic structure of the Constitution and the
			<lb />
			consequence of invalidation of such Amendment 733 .

			15.8
			<lb />
			In M. Nagaraj vs. Union of India 734 , Eighty-Fifth and
			<lb />
			allied amendments to the Constitution were called in question
			<lb />
			on the ground of violation of right of equality as a basic feature
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. While considering the challenge, it was
			<lb />
			observed that the Constitution sets out principles for an
			<lb />
			expanding future. This called for a purposive approach to the
			<lb />
			interpretation. It was observed that a constitutional provision
			<lb />
			must not be construed in a narrow sense but in a wide and
			<lb />
			liberal sense so as to take into account changing conditions
			<lb />
			and emerging problems and challenges. The content of the
			<lb />
			rights is to be defined by the Courts. Some of the concepts
			<lb />
			like federalism, secularism, reasonableness and socialism
			<lb />
			reasonableness are beyond the words of a particular provision.
			<lb />
			They give coherence to the Constitution and make the
			<lb />
			Constitution an organic whole. They are part of constitutional
			<lb />
			law even if they are not expressly stated in the form of rules.
			<lb />
			To qualify as essential feature, a principle has to be established
			<lb />
			as part of constitutional law and as such binding on the
			<lb />
			legislature. Only then, it could be examined whether it was a
			<lb />
			part of basic feature. Theory of basic feature was based on
			<lb />
			concept of constitutional identity.
			<lb />
			The personality of the
			<lb />
			Constitution must remain unchanged. The word &apos;amendment&apos;
			<lb />
			postulated that the Constitution survived without loss of
			<lb />
			identity despite the change. 735
			<lb />
			Conclusion:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			15.9 It can safely be held that a constitutional amendment has
			<lb />
			to pass the test of basic structure. Whether or not the basic
			<lb />
			structure was violated has to be finally determined by this
			<lb />
			Court from case to case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			B.
			<lb />
			Whether Primacy of Judiciary in Appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges is Part of Basic Structure
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16. Whether a feature of the Constitution is basic feature or
			<lb />
			part of basic structure is to be determined having regard to its
			<lb />
			place in the scheme of the Constitution and consequence of its
			<lb />
			denial on the working of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16.1 The judiciary has been assigned the role of determining
			<lb />
			powers of every Constitutional organ as also the rights of
			<lb />
			individuals. The disputes may arise between the Government
			<lb />
			of India and the States, between a citizen and the State or
			<lb />
			between a citizen and a citizen. Disputes relating to the
			<lb />
			powers of Union Legislature and the State Legislature or the
			<lb />
			exercise of the executive power may involve issues of
			<lb />
			constitutionality or legality.
			<lb />
			It may involve allegations of
			<lb />
			malafides even against highest constitutional dignitaries. This
			<lb />
			requires an impartial and independent judiciary. The judiciary
			<lb />
			is required to be separate from the executive control. Judiciary
			<lb />
			has to inspire confidence of the people for its impartiality and
			<lb />
			competence. It has not been disputed by learned Attorney
			<lb />
			General that independence of judiciary is part of the basic
			<lb />
			structure. It is also undisputed that judicial review is part of
			<lb />
			basic structure. The decisions of this Court expressly lay down
			<lb />
			that independence of judiciary and judicial review are part of
			<lb />
			basic structure. Broad separation of powers between the three
			<lb />
			departments of the State is a part of doctrine of checks and
			<lb />
			balances. It is also a part of democracy. Independence of
			<lb />
			judiciary is integral to the entire scheme of the Constitution
			<lb />
			without which neither primacy of the Constitution nor Federal
			<lb />
			character, Social Democracy nor rights of equality and liberty
			<lb />
			can be effective.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16.2 The judiciary has apolitical commitment in its functioning.
			<lb />
			Once independence of judiciary is acknowledged as a basic
			<lb />
			feature of the Constitution, question is whether power of
			<lb />
			appointing Judges can be delinked from the concept of
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary or is integral part of it. Can the
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary be maintained even if the
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges is controlled directly or indirectly by the
			<lb />
			executive?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16.3 To what extent primacy of judiciary in appointment of
			<lb />
			judges is part of unamendable basic feature of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. Since the issue has been gone into in earlier
			<lb />
			binding precedents, reference to such decisions is apt. As
			<lb />
			already mentioned, it remains undisputed that power of
			<lb />
			judicial review, independence of judiciary, broad separation of
			<lb />
			powers in three departments of the State, federalism and
			<lb />
			democracy are the basic features of the Constitution. Stand of
			<lb />
			the respondents is that power of appointment of judges does
			<lb />
			not have impact on such basic features as independence of
			<lb />
			judges is envisaged post appointment. By an amendment,
			<lb />
			process of appointment of judges can be altered to reduce the
			<lb />
			role of judiciary and to increase the role of Executive and
			<lb />
			Legislature. Alternatively, it is submitted that no substantial
			<lb />
			change has taken place in the said roles.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16.4 In Second Judge&apos;s case, a Bench of 9-Judges of this
			<lb />
			Court examined the question of interpretation of unamended
			<lb />
			constitutional scheme dealing with the appointment of judges
			<lb />
			of the Constitution case. The issue was referred to the Bench
			<lb />
			of 9-Judges on account of doubts having arisen as to the
			<lb />
			correctness of the view expressed in
			<lb />
			S.P. Gupta vs.
			<lb />
			Union of India 736 (First Judges&apos; case), laying down that
			<lb />
			primacy in the matter of appointment of judges rested with the
			<lb />
			Central Government 737 . The basis of the said decision was that
			<lb />
			the word &apos;consultation&apos; used in Articles 124, 217 etc. implied
			<lb />
			that the views of the consultee need not be treated as binding
			<lb />
			as the ultimate power of appointment rested with the Central
			<lb />
			Government. It was held that the views of the CJI or other
			<lb />
			Judges who were consulted may be entitled to great weight but
			<lb />
			the final view in case of difference of opinion could be taken by
			<lb />
			the Central Government. The word &apos;consultation&apos; could not be
			<lb />
			read as &apos;concurrence&apos;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16.5 The view taken was doubted in Subhash Sharma vs.
			<lb />
			Union of India 738 . The question whether opinion of CJI with
			<lb />
			regard to appointment of Judges was entitled to primacy was
			<lb />
			referred for consideration of a larger bench, as already
			<lb />
			mentioned.
			<lb />
			This Court observed that Constitutional
			<lb />
			phraseology was required to be read and expounded in the
			<lb />
			context of Constitutional philosophy of separation of powers
			<lb />
			736 1981 Supp. SCC 87, Para 30 (Primacy in appointment of judges is held to be of Central Government by
			<lb />
			holding that obligation of the President (the Central Government) was only to consult the judiciary which
			<lb />
			could not be treated as binding)
			<lb />
			737 Para 25, Pandian J. (Second Judges Case) : Reasons which led to reconsideration of First Judges&apos; case
			<lb />
			738 1991 Supp (1) SCC 574 -Paras 31-34, 42-46
			<lb />
			Page 952
			<lb />
			and the cherished values of judicial independence. The role of
			<lb />
			the CJI was required to be recognised as of crucial importance
			<lb />
			for which the view taken in First Judges&apos; case required
			<lb />
			reconsideration by a larger Bench. It was noted that there was
			<lb />
			an anxiety on the part of the Government of the day to assert
			<lb />
			choice in selection of Judges and if the power to recommend
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges was vested in the State Government or
			<lb />
			the Central Government, the picture was likely to be blurred
			<lb />
			and process of selection may turn out to be difficult. It was
			<lb />
			also observed that the judiciary had apolitical commitment and
			<lb />
			the assurance of non-political complexion of judiciary should
			<lb />
			not be divorced from the process of appointment. The phrase
			<lb />
			&quot;consultation&quot; had to be understood consistent with and to
			<lb />
			promote the constitutional spirit. The constitutional values
			<lb />
			could not be whittled down by calling the appointment of
			<lb />
			judges as an executive act. The appointment was rather the
			<lb />
			result of collective constitutional process. It could not be said
			<lb />
			that power to appoint solely vested with the executive or that
			<lb />
			the executive was free to take such decision as it deems fit
			<lb />
			after consultation with the judiciary. The word &quot;consultation&quot;
			<lb />
			was used in recognition of the status of high constitutional
			<lb />
			dignitary and could not be interpreted literally. Moreover, the
			<lb />
			appointment not recommended by Chief Justice of the State
			<lb />
			and the CJI would be inappropriate and arbitrary exercise of
			<lb />
			power. The CJI should have preponderant role. Primacy of CJI
			<lb />
			will improve the quality of selection. The view of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justices of States and CJI should be decisive unless the
			<lb />
			executive had material indicating that the appointee will be
			<lb />
			undesirable. The view of the majority in First Judges&apos; case
			<lb />
			did not recognise the said pivotal position of the institution of
			<lb />
			the CJI and correctness of the said opinion required
			<lb />
			reconsideration. It was noted that the Union Government had
			<lb />
			often stated before Parliament and outside that as a matter of
			<lb />
			policy it had not made any appointment without the name
			<lb />
			being given by the CJI and the executive must be held to the
			<lb />
			standard by which it professed its actions to be judged. Upon
			<lb />
			reference to larger Bench, the view taken in First Judges
			<lb />
			case was overruled in Second Judges&apos; case which was
			<lb />
			reiterated in the Third Judges case. It held that the term
			<lb />
			&quot;consultation&quot; in Article 124 should not be literally construed.
			<lb />
			It was to be construed in the constitutional background of its
			<lb />
			purpose and to maintain and uphold independence of judiciary.
			<lb />
			So interpreted, it was held that in the event of conflicting
			<lb />
			opinions of the constitutional functionaries, the opinion of the
			<lb />
			judiciary as symbolized by the view of the CJI and formed in
			<lb />
			the manner indicated, would have primacy.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16.6 Pandian, J. held that the requirement of consultation was
			<lb />
			not relatable to any other service and only applied to
			<lb />
			appointment of judges in contrast to other high ranking offices.
			<lb />
			The consultation with the CJI was condition precedent for
			<lb />
			appointment and advice given by the judiciary in the process
			<lb />
			had sanctity. The executive power of appointment comes into
			<lb />
			play by virtue of Articles 74 and 163 though it was not
			<lb />
			specifically provided for in Articles 124 and 217. The State
			<lb />
			was major litigant.
			<lb />
			The superior courts were faced with
			<lb />
			controversies with political flavour and in such a situation if the
			<lb />
			executive had absolute say in appointment of judges, the
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary will be damaged.
			<lb />
			The Law
			<lb />
			Commission Reports and opinion of jurists suggested radical
			<lb />
			change in appointment of judges by curbing the executive
			<lb />
			power 739 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16.7 Kuldip Singh, J. observed that the concept of judicial
			<lb />
			independence did not only mean the security of tenure to
			<lb />
			individual judges. There has to be independence of judiciary
			<lb />
			as an institution so that it could effectively act as an impartial
			<lb />
			umpire between the Governments and the individuals or
			<lb />
			between the Governments inter se. It would be illogical to say
			<lb />
			that the judiciary could be independent when power of
			<lb />
			appointment vested in the Executive. The framers of the
			<lb />
			Constitution never intended to give this power to the Executive
			<lb />
			which was the largest litigant before the courts 740 . There was
			<lb />
			established constitutional convention recognising the primal
			<lb />
			and binding opinion of CJI in the matter of appointment of
			<lb />
			judges. All appointments since the commencement of the
			<lb />
			Constitution were made with the concurrence of the CJI. The
			<lb />
			14 th Report of the Law Commission and discussion in the
			<lb />
			Parliament on 23 rd and 24 th November, 1959 were referred
			<lb />
			to 741 . With regard to the statement of Dr. Ambedkar on 24 th
			<lb />
			May, 1949 before the Constituent Assembly that the CJI could
			<lb />
			not be given a veto on appointment of judges, it was observed
			<lb />
			that primacy of the CJI acting in representative as against
			<lb />
			individual capacity would not be against the objective of the
			<lb />
			said statement 742 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16.8 Verma, J. observed that the scheme of the Constitution of
			<lb />
			separation of powers, with the Directive Principles of
			<lb />
			separation of judiciary from Executive, and role of the judiciary
			<lb />
			to secure rule of law required that appointment of judges in
			<lb />
			superior judiciary could not be left to the discretion of the
			<lb />
			Executive. Independence of judges was required even at the
			<lb />
			time of their appointment instead of confining it to the
			<lb />
			provisions for security of tenure and conditions of service. It
			<lb />
			was necessary to prevent influence of political consideration
			<lb />
			on account of appointments by the Executive. In choice of a
			<lb />
			candidate, opinion of CJI should have greatest weight. The role
			<lb />
			of the Executive in the participatory consultative process was
			<lb />
			intended to be by way of a check on the exercise of power by
			<lb />
			the CJI. The Executive element was to be the minimum to
			<lb />
			eliminate political influence 743 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16.9 Accordingly, conclusions were recorded in para 486 to
			<lb />
			the effect that initiation of proposal for appointment and
			<lb />
			transfer could be initiated by the judiciary and in case of
			<lb />
			conflicting opinions, the opinion of the CJI had the primacy. In
			<lb />
			exceptional cases the appointment could be declined by
			<lb />
			disclosing the reasons but if the reasons were not accepted by
			<lb />
			the CJI acting in representative capacity, the appointment was
			<lb />
			required to be made as a healthy convention. The CJI was to
			<lb />
			be appointed by seniority. The senior most judge, considered
			<lb />
			fit to hold the office, was to be the CJI.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16.10
			<lb />
			Conclusions in Third Judges&apos; case in para 44
			<lb />
			reiterated this view with only slight modification. On that
			<lb />
			basis, memoranda of procedure mentioned in earlier part of
			<lb />
			this opinion were issued. The National Commission to Review
			<lb />
			the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) headed by Justice
			<lb />
			M.N. Venkatachaliah, in its report dated 31 st March, 2002,
			<lb />
			observed that appointment of judges was part of
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary. It was observed that the Executive
			<lb />
			taking over the power of appointment and playing a dominant
			<lb />
			role will be violative, of basic structure of the Constitution, of
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary 744 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16.11
			<lb />
			Contention of the petitioners is that the said
			<lb />
			decisions conclusively recognise primacy of judiciary in
			<lb />
			appointment of judges inferred from the scheme of the
			<lb />
			Constitution and such primacy was part of basic structure.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16.12
			<lb />
			It is submitted that if the Executive has primacy,
			<lb />
			the power of appointment of Judges can be used to affect or
			<lb />
			subvert the independence of the appointees as members of
			<lb />
			the Constitutional Courts. This would be against the intention
			<lb />
			of the Constitution makers. The unamended provision could
			<lb />
			not be replaced by the new mechanism unless the new
			<lb />
			mechanism ensured that a role of the Judiciary was not
			<lb />
			decreased and the role of the Executive was not increased and
			<lb />
			the change made had no adverse impact on the functioning of
			<lb />
			the Constitution. If this contention is upheld, the impugned
			<lb />
			amendment will have to be struck down unless it could be held
			<lb />
			that the amended provisions also retained the said primacy. If
			<lb />
			primacy of judiciary is held not to be a part of basic structure
			<lb />
			of the Constitution or it is held that the same is still retained,
			<lb />
			the amendment will have to be upheld.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			C.
			<lb />
			Plea of the Respondents for re-visiting earlier
			<lb />
			binding precedents
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			17. The correctness of the view taken in the above decisions
			<lb />
			was sought to be challenged by learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			respondents.
			<lb />
			The ground on which reconsideration of the
			<lb />
			earlier view is sought is that the interpretation in Second and
			<lb />
			Third Judges cases is patently erroneous. Members of the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly never intended that the CJI should have
			<lb />
			last word on the subject of appointment of Judges. The text
			<lb />
			which was finally approved and which became part of the
			<lb />
			Constitution did not provide for concurrence of the CJI as has
			<lb />
			been laid down by this Court. It is also submitted that the
			<lb />
			interpretation taken by this Court may have been justified on
			<lb />
			account of the abuse of powers by the Executive specially
			<lb />
			during emergency (as noticed in Union of India vs.
			<lb />
			Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth 745 ) and in the Law Commission
			<lb />
			Reports (particularly 14 th and 121 st Reports), the same
			<lb />
			situation no longer continues. More over there is global trend
			<lb />
			for Judicial Appointment Commissions. Even without primacy
			<lb />
			of the judiciary in appointment of judges, the judiciary could
			<lb />
			function independently. Judicial Appointment Commission was
			<lb />
			suggested even earlier. The eminent jurists had criticized the
			<lb />
			existing mechanism for appointment of Judges and particularly
			<lb />
			the working of the collegium system.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			17.1 Referring to the scheme of Chapter IV of the Constitution,
			<lb />
			learned Attorney General submitted that Executive and the
			<lb />
			Legislature had the role in the working of the judiciary. Salary
			<lb />
			and Conditions of Service of Judges are fixed by the
			<lb />
			Parliament. The Rules for functioning of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			are framed with the approval of the President and are subject
			<lb />
			to the law made by the Parliament. Parliament could confer
			<lb />
			supplementary powers on the Supreme Court. Conditions of
			<lb />
			service of officers and servants of the Supreme Court are
			<lb />
			subject to law made by the Parliament. The rules framed by
			<lb />
			the CJI require approval of the President. There was inter play
			<lb />
			of Executive and Legislature in the functioning of the judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Independence of judges was in respect of their security of
			<lb />
			tenure and service conditions. Manner of appointment did not
			<lb />
			affect independence of judiciary.
			<lb />
			Executive appointing
			<lb />
			Comptroller General of India or Election Commission did not
			<lb />
			affect their independence. Power of appointment of judges is
			<lb />
			the Executive power to be exercised by the President with the
			<lb />
			advice of the Council of Ministers after consultation with the
			<lb />
			judiciary. The doctrine of separation of powers or separation of
			<lb />
			judiciary from Executive does not require that the Executive
			<lb />
			could have no role in appointment of judges. Primacy of
			<lb />
			judiciary in appointment of judges ignores the principles of
			<lb />
			checks and balances. The interpretation placed in the earlier
			<lb />
			decisions ignores the principles of transparency and
			<lb />
			accountability. Even without there being manifest error in
			<lb />
			earlier decisions, having regard to the sensitive nature of the
			<lb />
			issue and also the fact that an amendment has now been
			<lb />
			brought about, the earlier decisions need to be revisited.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			17.2 The stand of learned Attorney General and other learned
			<lb />
			counsel appearing for the respondents was contested by
			<lb />
			learned counsel for the petitioners. It was submitted that all
			<lb />
			issues sought to be raised by the respondents were duly
			<lb />
			considered by the Bench of nine-judges.
			<lb />
			The Central
			<lb />
			Government sought opinion of this Court under Article 143. A
			<lb />
			statement was made by the then learned Attorney General
			<lb />
			that the Second Judges&apos; case was not sought to be
			<lb />
			reconsidered. The view of the nine-Judge Bench was based on
			<lb />
			earlier binding decisions in Shamsher Singh vs. State of
			<lb />
			Punjab 746 and Sankalchand case (supra) laying down that
			<lb />
			the last word on such matters was of the CJI. The expert
			<lb />
			studies and the Constituent Assembly Debates ruled out
			<lb />
			pre-dominant role for the Executive or Legislature in
			<lb />
			appointment of judges. The constitutional scheme did not
			<lb />
			permit interference of the Executive in appointment of judges.
			<lb />
			The Executive could give feed back and carry out the
			<lb />
			Executive functions by making appointments but the proposal
			<lb />
			had to be initiated and finalised by the judiciary. Frequent
			<lb />
			reconsideration of opinions by larger Benches of this Court was
			<lb />
			not desirable in absence of any doubt about the correctness of
			<lb />
			the earlier view.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			17.3 Parameters for determining as to when earlier binding
			<lb />
			decisions ought to be reopened have been repeatedly laid
			<lb />
			down by this Court. The settled principle is that court should
			<lb />
			not, except when it is demonstrated beyond all reasonable
			<lb />
			doubts that its previous ruling given after due deliberation and
			<lb />
			full hearing was erroneous, revisit earlier decisions so that the
			<lb />
			law remains certain. 747 In exceptional circumstances or under
			<lb />
			new set of conditions in the light of new ideas, earlier view, if
			<lb />
			considered mistaken, can be reversed. While march of law
			<lb />
			continues and new systems can be developed whenever
			<lb />
			needed, it can be done only if earlier systems are considered
			<lb />
			unworkable 748 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			17.4 No such situation has arisen. On settled principles, no
			<lb />
			case for revisiting earlier decisions by larger Benches is made
			<lb />
			out. As regards the contention that there was patent error in
			<lb />
			the earlier decisions, the Second Judges&apos; case shows that
			<lb />
			the Constituent Assembly Debates are exhaustively quoted
			<lb />
			and considered. Neither the debates nor the text adopted by
			<lb />
			the Constitution show that the power of appointment of Judges
			<lb />
			was intended to be conferred on the Executive or the
			<lb />
			Legislature.
			<lb />
			The word &apos;consultation&apos; as interpreted and
			<lb />
			understood meant that the final word on the subject of
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges was with the CJI. The practice and
			<lb />
			convention ever since the commencement of the Constitution
			<lb />
			showed that proposal for appointment was always initiated by
			<lb />
			the Judiciary and the last word on the subject belonged to the
			<lb />
			CJI. This scheme was consistent with the intention of the
			<lb />
			Constitution makers. All the points now sought to be raised by
			<lb />
			learned Attorney General have been exhaustively considered
			<lb />
			in the Second Judges case. The contention that earlier
			<lb />
			situation of Executive interference has now changed also does
			<lb />
			not justify reconsideration of the earlier view. If the situation
			<lb />
			has changed, there can be no reason for change of the system
			<lb />
			which is functioning as per the intention of the Constitution
			<lb />
			makers when such change will be contrary to basic structure
			<lb />
			which is not constitutionally permissible. The objection as to
			<lb />
			deficiencies in the working of the collegium system will be
			<lb />
			subject matter of discussion in the later part of this judgment.
			<lb />
			Individual failings may never be ruled out in functioning of any
			<lb />
			system.
			<lb />
			The Judicial Appointment Commissions earlier
			<lb />
			considered were not on the same pattern. Initially proposal to
			<lb />
			set up Judicial Commission was made prior to Second Judges
			<lb />
			case, with the object of doing away with the primacy of the
			<lb />
			Executive as laid down in First Judges case.
			<lb />
			In
			<lb />
			Sixty-Seventh Amendment Bill, in the Statement of Objects
			<lb />
			and Reasons, it is mentioned that the object of setting up of
			<lb />
			Commission was to &apos;obviate the criticism of arbitrariness on
			<lb />
			the part of the Executive&apos; 749 . Ninety-Eighth Amendment Bill,
			<lb />
			2003 was introduced with a different composition on
			<lb />
			recommendation of National Commission to review the
			<lb />
			working of the Constitution. One-Twentieth Amendment Bill,
			<lb />
			2013 did not provide for any composition and left the
			<lb />
			composition to be provided for by the Parliament. Validity of
			<lb />
			such proposed Commissions was never tested as such
			<lb />
			Commissions never came into existence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			17.5
			<lb />
			The Judicial Commissions in other countries and
			<lb />
			provisions of Constitutions of other countries conferring power
			<lb />
			on the Executive to appoint Judges may also not call for
			<lb />
			reconsideration of the Second Judges&apos; case as many of such
			<lb />
			and similar provisions were duly considered in the Second
			<lb />
			Judges&apos; case to which reference will be made. No case is
			<lb />
			thus made out for revisiting the earlier decisions in Second
			<lb />
			and Third Judges&apos; cases.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			D.
			<lb />
			Consequential consideration of issue of primacy of
			<lb />
			judiciary in appointment of judges as part of basic
			<lb />
			structure.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			18. The earlier decisions in Second and Third Judges&apos;
			<lb />
			case have to be taken as binding precedents. Once it is so, it
			<lb />
			has to be held that primacy of the judiciary in appointment of
			<lb />
			judges is part of the basic structure. Appointment of judges is
			<lb />
			part of independence of judiciary. It is also essential to uphold
			<lb />
			balance of powers between Legislature, Executive and
			<lb />
			Judiciary which by itself is key to the functioning of the entire
			<lb />
			Constitution. The judiciary is entrusted the power to control
			<lb />
			the power of the Executive and the Legislature whenever it is
			<lb />
			alleged that the said organs have exceeded their
			<lb />
			constitutionally assigned authority. This is the essence of the
			<lb />
			democracy. Learned counsel for the petitioners highlighted
			<lb />
			that at times exercise of powers of Judicial Review by the
			<lb />
			Constitutional Courts may not be to the liking of the Executive
			<lb />
			or the Legislature. Particular instances have been given of
			<lb />
			decisions of this Court in 2G Spectrum case 750 and Coal
			<lb />
			Scam case 751 where actions of the Executive were found to be
			<lb />
			violative of constitutional obligations causing huge loss to
			<lb />
			public exchequer. It was submitted that arbitrary distribution
			<lb />
			of State largess by way of giving scarce resources or contracts
			<lb />
			or jobs or positions of importance akin to &apos;spoil system&apos; have
			<lb />
			been held by this Court to be in violation of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			Policies of the State for arbitrary acquisition of land or in
			<lb />
			violation of environmental laws have been struck down by this
			<lb />
			Court. Dissolution of State Assemblies and dismissal of State
			<lb />
			Governments have also been struck down by this Court 752 .
			<lb />
			This Court also had to deal with the issues arising out of
			<lb />
			decisions of Speakers in recognizing or otherwise the
			<lb />
			defections in Central or State Legislatures 753 .
			<lb />
			There are
			<lb />
			enumerable instances when the Courts have to deal with
			<lb />
			validity of Legislative or Executive decisions of far reaching
			<lb />
			nature. It is the faith of the people in the impartiality and
			<lb />
			competence of judiciary which sustains democracy.
			<lb />
			If
			<lb />
			appointment of judges, which is integral to functioning of
			<lb />
			judiciary is influenced or controlled by the Executive, it will
			<lb />
			certainly affect impartiality of judges and their functioning.
			<lb />
			Faith of people in impartiality and effectiveness of judiciary in
			<lb />
			protecting their constitutional rights will be eroded.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			18.1 Submissions of learned Attorney General are that even if
			<lb />
			appointment of judges is held to be part of independence of
			<lb />
			judiciary, choice of a particular model is not part of basic
			<lb />
			structure.
			<lb />
			The role of the Executive cannot be denied
			<lb />
			altogether nor there can be any objection to members of civil
			<lb />
			society being included in the process of appointment. The
			<lb />
			primacy of judiciary in appointment of judges is not an
			<lb />
			absolutist ideal.
			<lb />
			Power of appointment has to be seen in the
			<lb />
			light of need for checks and balances. Independence of
			<lb />
			judiciary is not a uni-dimensional test. There could be inter
			<lb />
			mingling of other wings in the process of appointment of
			<lb />
			judges. After repeal of Articles 124 and 217, basis of Second
			<lb />
			Judges&apos; case did not survive. Primacy of judiciary in
			<lb />
			appointment of judges is only in the context of stopping wrong
			<lb />
			appointment or preventing pre-dominance of the Executive.
			<lb />
			Even if primacy of judiciary was recognized at a given point of
			<lb />
			time, the same could apply only till the Constitution is
			<lb />
			amended.
			<lb />
			Two eminent persons could be laymen to give
			<lb />
			societal view point. The Law Minister was made a member of
			<lb />
			the Commission for accountability and transparency. As laid
			<lb />
			down in I.R. Coelho case, inspite of separation of powers,
			<lb />
			different branches of the Government could have overlapping
			<lb />
			functions 754 . In Sahara India Real Estate Corpn. Ltd. vs.
			<lb />
			SEBI 755 , it was observed that under the Constitution there are
			<lb />
			different values which must be balanced. Thus, independence
			<lb />
			of judiciary, checks and balances, democracy and separation
			<lb />
			of powers are to be considered as a whole. He referred to the
			<lb />
			background of supersession of judges in the year 1973 and
			<lb />
			1977 and selective transfer of judges during emergency as
			<lb />
			noted in 121 st Report of the Law Commission 756 . The report
			<lb />
			records that in 1976, sixteen judges were transferred from the
			<lb />
			respective High Courts in which they were functioning to other
			<lb />
			High Courts. This was perceived to be an act of interference
			<lb />
			with the judiciary. Circular of the then Law Minister providing
			<lb />
			for transfer and short term appointment of judges considered
			<lb />
			in First Judges&apos; case was taken in the said report as the
			<lb />
			executive interference. The report also mentioned the concern
			<lb />
			arising out of supersession in appointment of CJI, non
			<lb />
			confirmation of additional judges, transfer of judges giving rise
			<lb />
			to apprehension of erosion of independence of judiciary at the
			<lb />
			hands of the Executive. It was concluded that the model then
			<lb />
			prevalent (with the primacy of the Executive) had failed to
			<lb />
			deliver the goods. This led to introduction of 67 th Amendment
			<lb />
			Bill, 1990.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			18.2 The contentions of learned Attorney General cannot be
			<lb />
			accepted. The matter having been gone into in great details in
			<lb />
			above
			<lb />
			binding
			<lb />
			precedents
			<lb />
			which
			<lb />
			do
			<lb />
			not
			<lb />
			require
			<lb />
			reconsideration, I do not consider it necessary to repeat in
			<lb />
			detail the discussion which has been recorded in the said
			<lb />
			decisions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			18.3
			<lb />
			In Second Judges&apos; case, following findings have
			<lb />
			been recorded :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The word &apos;consultation&apos; used in Articles
			<lb />
			124, 217 and 222 of the Constitution
			<lb />
			meant that the opinion of consultee was
			<lb />
			normally
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			be
			<lb />
			accepted
			<lb />
			thereby
			<lb />
			according primacy to the judiciary;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			The Executive being major litigant and role of
			<lb />
			judiciary being to impartially decide
			<lb />
			disputes between citizen and the State, the
			<lb />
			Executive could not have decisive say in
			<lb />
			appointing judges;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Doctrine of separation of powers under the
			<lb />
			Constitution required primacy of judiciary
			<lb />
			in appointing judges;
			<lb />
			Since traits of candidates could be better
			<lb />
			assessed by the Chief Justice, the view of
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice as to suitability and merit
			<lb />
			of the candidate had higher weight;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			The Chief Justice of India was not to make a
			<lb />
			recommendation
			<lb />
			individually
			<lb />
			but
			<lb />
			as
			<lb />
			representing the judiciary in the manner
			<lb />
			laid down, that is, after consulting the
			<lb />
			collegium; and
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Primacy of judiciary in appointment of judges is
			<lb />
			part of independence of judiciary and
			<lb />
			separation
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			powers
			<lb />
			under
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			18.4
			<lb />
			Referring to the constitutional scheme, its
			<lb />
			background and interpretation, irrespective of the literal
			<lb />
			meaning of the language employed in Articles 214 and 217 of
			<lb />
			the Constitution, it was observed that initiation of proposal
			<lb />
			must always emanate from the Chief Justice of the High
			<lb />
			Court/CJI (in representative capacity as laid down) and last
			<lb />
			word on any objection thereto should be normally of the CJI. 757
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			18.5 Reference was made to the interpretation of the word
			<lb />
			&apos;consultation&apos; in the context of appointment of judges in earlier
			<lb />
			judgments in Chandra Moulishwar Prasad vs. Patna High
			<lb />
			Court 758 , Shamsher Singh and Sankalchand cases. It was
			<lb />
			held that &quot;in practice, the last word in such sensitive subject
			<lb />
			must belong to CJI, the rejection of his advice being ordinarily
			<lb />
			regarded as prompted by oblique considerations vitiating the
			<lb />
			order.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			18.6
			<lb />
			Reference was also made to the statement of Dr.
			<lb />
			Ambedkar that it was dangerous to give power to appoint
			<lb />
			judges to the Executive or with concurrence of the
			<lb />
			Legislature. 759 Further statement that it was dangerous to give
			<lb />
			veto power to CJI was explained to mean that the CJI must act
			<lb />
			not in individual capacity but after consulting senior judges. 760
			<lb />
			18.7
			<lb />
			Needless to say that the Constitution of India is
			<lb />
			unique. While reference to other Constitutions can be made
			<lb />
			for certain purposes 761 , the basic features of Indian
			<lb />
			Constitution (which may be distinctly different from other
			<lb />
			Constitutions) have to be retained and cannot be given a go
			<lb />
			bye. In the above judgment, in the context of working of
			<lb />
			Indian Constitution, it was held that the role of Executive and
			<lb />
			Legislature in appointment of judges could not be
			<lb />
			predominant. Even in the Constituent Assembly, models of
			<lb />
			other countries were not found to be suitable to be followed in
			<lb />
			India 762 .
			<lb />
			As already mentioned the Government of India
			<lb />
			appointed First Law Commission headed by Shri M.C. Stealvad
			<lb />
			to review the system of judicial administration and all its
			<lb />
			aspects.
			<lb />
			The Commission expressly mentioned that the
			<lb />
			Executive interference in appointment of Judges has not been
			<lb />
			congenial to independence of judiciary. The Commission noted
			<lb />
			that the Chief Ministers were having direct or indirect hand in
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges which results in appointments being
			<lb />
			made not on merit but on considerations of community, caste,
			<lb />
			political affiliations. The Chief Minister holding a political office
			<lb />
			is dependent on the goodwill of his party followers. The
			<lb />
			recommendation of the CJI is more likely to be on merit. An
			<lb />
			opinion noted in the report mentions that if the Executive
			<lb />
			continued to have powerful role, the independence of judiciary
			<lb />
			will disappear and the Courts will be filled with Judges who owe
			<lb />
			from appointments to politicians 763 . It was recommended that
			<lb />
			the hands of CJI should be strengthened and instead of
			<lb />
			requiring consultation it should require recommendation by the
			<lb />
			CJI 764 . There should be requirement of concurrence of the
			<lb />
			CJI 765 . The Report was discussed in the Parliament and the
			<lb />
			then Home Minister declared that the Executive was only an
			<lb />
			order issuing authority and appointments were virtually being
			<lb />
			made by the CJI. This statement was reiterated by the then
			<lb />
			Law Minister 766 . Again in 121 st Report, it was observed that
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges with Executive influence was not
			<lb />
			conducive to healthy growth of judicial review. Trends all over
			<lb />
			the world indicate that power of the Executive in appointment
			<lb />
			of Judges was required to be diluted 767 . The Second Judges&apos;
			<lb />
			case took care of the ground realities in the light of
			<lb />
			constitutional convention. It held that the CJI was better
			<lb />
			equipped to select the best and for appointments being free
			<lb />
			from Executive domination to inspire public confidence in
			<lb />
			impartiality and consistent with the principle of separation of
			<lb />
			Judiciary from Executive and also consistent with the spirit of
			<lb />
			Constitution makers. The principle of primacy was recognised
			<lb />
			and appointment of Judges was held to be integral to the
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary 768 . To check arbitrary exercise of
			<lb />
			power by any individual, it was made mandatory that the Chief
			<lb />
			Justices consult senior Judges. Thus, primacy of judiciary was
			<lb />
			recognized in initiating proposal as well as in taking final
			<lb />
			decision 769 . However, participation of the Executive in giving
			<lb />
			inputs by suggesting names before the proposal was initiated
			<lb />
			Paras 362-371 (Second Judges&apos; case)
			<lb />
			Paras 7.5 -7.11 (121 st Law Commission Report)

			Paras 333-335, Kuldip Singh, J., Paras 47, 49,63, Pandian, J.
			<lb />
			Para 486
			<lb />
			or giving feedback even after the proposal was initiated was
			<lb />
			permissible. It was noted that right from beginning of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, all the proposals for appointments were always
			<lb />
			initiated by the Chief Justices 770 . View in First Judges&apos; case
			<lb />
			that primacy in appointment of Judges was of the Central
			<lb />
			Government was held to be erroneous by larger Bench inter
			<lb />
			alia for following reasons :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(i) The judiciary has apolitical commitment
			<lb />
			and if power of appointment of judges is
			<lb />
			given to the Executive, this will affect
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary 771 ;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) Rule of law requires that justice is
			<lb />
			impartial and people have confidence in
			<lb />
			judiciary being separate and independent
			<lb />
			of the Executive so that it can discharge
			<lb />
			its functions of keeping vigilant watch for
			<lb />
			protection of rights even against the
			<lb />
			Executive 772 ;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii)
			<lb />
			Judiciary has key role in working of the
			<lb />
			democracy and for upholding the rule of
			<lb />
			law 773 ;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iv)
			<lb />
			The constitutional scheme provides for
			<lb />
			mandatory consultation with the CJI since
			<lb />
			the CJI was better equipped to assess the
			<lb />
			merit of the candidate which consultation
			<lb />
			was not provided for in respect of other
			<lb />
			high constitutional appointments 774 .
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(v)
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			appointment
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			judges
			<lb />
			was
			<lb />
			inextricably linked with the independence
			<lb />
			of judiciary and even in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of district judges, the
			<lb />
			conclusive say was of the High Courts and
			<lb />
			not of the Government 775 .

			(vii) The effort of the Executive to have say in

			expert studies to be not congenial to the

			independence of judiciary 777 . Reference
			<lb />
			was made to the 14 th Report of the Law
			<lb />
			Commission that if the Executive had
			<lb />
			powerful voice in appointment of judges,
			<lb />
			the independence of judiciary will
			<lb />
			disappear and the courts will be filled with
			<lb />
			judges who owe their appointments to the
			<lb />
			politicians. Reference was also made to
			<lb />
			121 st Report of the Law Commission to the
			<lb />

			to create a check on the power of the

			<lb />
			other judges as may be considered necessary cannot be
			<lb />
			accepted, even if it is so suggested by the literal meaning of
			<lb />
			the words used in the text of the provision. It may be
			<lb />
			mentioned that the word &apos;consultation&apos;, on account of the
			<lb />
			scheme of the Constitution, was held to carry special meaning,
			<lb />
			on a purposive interpretation. The interpretation was not
			<lb />
			based solely on the word &apos;consultation&apos; but on scheme of
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary. The contention that independence
			<lb />
			of judiciary was not affected even when the Executive made
			<lb />
			the appointment is contrary to the expert studies and well
			<lb />
			considered decisions of this Court. The acknowledged scheme
			<lb />
			of the Constitution and its working is not to allow domination
			<lb />
			of the Executive in appointment of Judges. Such domination
			<lb />
			affects independence of judiciary, public faith in its impartiality
			<lb />
			(when the Government is major litigant), brings in extraneous
			<lb />
			considerations, compromises merit, weakens the principles of
			<lb />
			checks and balances and separation of judiciary from the
			<lb />
			Executive. Thus, by substitution of the words, the Parliament
			<lb />
			could not interfere with the primacy of judiciary in
			<lb />
			appointment of judges and thereby interfere with the basic
			<lb />
			feature of the Constitution. It may be mentioned that use of
			<lb />
			similar expression in Article 74 of the Constitution in the
			<lb />
			context of Executive power of the President to act on &quot;aid and
			<lb />
			advice&quot; of Council of Ministers was held to mean that the
			<lb />
			President was only a formal head. 780 It cannot be suggested
			<lb />
			that by amendment of the expression used, constitutional
			<lb />
			scheme of the President being formal head can be changed as
			<lb />
			such amendment will be repugnant to the basic structure of
			<lb />
			the Constitution. Likewise, even by amendment primacy of
			<lb />
			judiciary in appointment of judges cannot be excluded. Such
			<lb />
			primacy existed not merely by word &apos;consultation&apos; but by
			<lb />
			virtue of role of judiciary in working of the Constitution, by CJI
			<lb />
			being better suited to assess merit of the candidate and on
			<lb />
			account of Executive being major litigant. There is no change
			<lb />
			in these factors even after amendment. It is not thus a
			<lb />
			question of change of model or of available choice with the
			<lb />
			Parliament. Plea of presumption of constitutionality can be of
			<lb />
			no avail where an established basic feature of the Constitution
			<lb />
			is sought to be damaged. Similarly, the plea that Parliament is
			<lb />
			best equipped to assess the needs of the people is not enough
			<lb />
			reason to extend the power of Parliament to amend the basic
			<lb />
			feature of the Constitution. The change of time does not
			<lb />
			justify greater role for the Executive in appointment of judges.
			<lb />
			The plea of overlapping role of different Departments of the
			<lb />
			Government is against the basic structure as far as
			<lb />
			appointment of judges is concerned.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			18.9
			<lb />
			While it is true that the Legislature can even
			<lb />
			retrospectively clarify its intention and thereby bring about a
			<lb />
			change in law 781 , in the present context meaning of the
			<lb />
			unamended provision was not based merely on the words used
			<lb />
			but also the entire scheme of the Constitution particularly the
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary. It has been held that in the context
			<lb />
			of the Indian Constitution, having regard to the consistent past
			<lb />
			practice and to avoid political interference in appointment of
			<lb />
			judges, and also on account of the CJI/CJ being better equipped
			<lb />
			to assess the merit of a candidate, proposal must always be
			<lb />
			initiated by the CJI/CJ and the CJI must also have final word on
			<lb />
			the subject. It can hardly be doubted that the Constitution is a
			<lb />
			dynamic document and has to be interpreted to meet the felt
			<lb />
			needs of times and cannot bind all future generations. At the
			<lb />
			same time, it is also now well settled that the amending power
			<lb />
			is limited to non essential/non basic features and does not
			<lb />
			extend to altering the basic features and framework of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. Primacy of judiciary is certainly a part of the
			<lb />
			basic feature of the Constitution. If primacy of judiciary in the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges is held to be not a part of basic feature,
			<lb />
			the Parliament may be free to confer the said power on the
			<lb />
			Executive or the Legislature or to any other authority which
			<lb />
			can certainly compromise the independence of judiciary. It will
			<lb />
			also in turn disturb the doctrine of separation of powers and
			<lb />
			other basic features like rule of law, democracy and federalism
			<lb />
			and working of the Constitution as a whole. Independence of
			<lb />
			judiciary is key element in the entire functioning of the
			<lb />
			Constitution and such independence is integrally linked with
			<lb />
			the appointment of judges free from Executive interference.
			<lb />
			The alternative submission of Shri Venugopal, learned senior
			<lb />
			counsel appearing for the State of Madhya Pradesh in Paras 4
			<lb />
			and 8 (reproduced in para 13 above) also supports the
			<lb />
			conclusion that appointment of judges is part of independence
			<lb />
			of judiciary and primacy of judiciary in appointment of judges
			<lb />
			is required to be retained. The power of appointment of judges
			<lb />
			cannot be exercised by the Executive as the same will affect
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary. Even after the original provisions
			<lb />
			are amended, this principle is still applicable.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			18.10
			<lb />
			At this stage, it may be mentioned that any
			<lb />
			perceived shortcoming in the working of existing mechanism
			<lb />
			of appointment of judges cannot by itself justify alteration or
			<lb />
			damage of the existing scheme once it is held to be part of
			<lb />
			basic feature. As Dr. Ambedkar observed 782 :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The Constitution can provide only the organs of
			<lb />
			State such as the Legislature, the Executive and
			<lb />
			the Judiciary. The factors on which the working of
			<lb />
			782 In speech dated 25.11.1949 on conclusion of proceedings of the Constituent Assembly (Page 975 of the
			<lb />
			CAD).
			<lb />
			*In his speech as President of the Constituent Assembly quoted in Para 429 of the Second Judges&apos;
			<lb />
			case)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			those organs of the State depend are the people
			<lb />
			and the political parties they will set up as their
			<lb />
			instruments to carry out their wishes and their
			<lb />
			politics.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			To the same effect Dr. Rajendra Prasad* said :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;If the people who are elected are capable and
			<lb />
			men of character and integrity, they would be able
			<lb />
			to make the best even of a defective Constitution.
			<lb />
			If they are lacking in these, the Constitution
			<lb />
			cannot help the country. After all, a Constitution
			<lb />
			like a machine is a lifeless thing. It acquires life
			<lb />
			because of the men who control it and operate it,
			<lb />
			and India needs today nothing more than a set of
			<lb />
			honest men who will have the interest of the
			<lb />
			country before them.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Even a good system may have shortcomings in its working on
			<lb />
			account of individual failures. It may be mentioned that
			<lb />
			criticism of working may be leveled against working of every
			<lb />
			organ of the Constitution including the Executive and the
			<lb />
			Legislature and while all efforts must be continuously made to
			<lb />
			bring about improvement in every sphere, the basic scheme
			<lb />
			set up by the Constitution cannot be given a go bye on that
			<lb />
			ground. It is not necessary to comment upon how good or bad
			<lb />
			any constitutional authorities have performed in discharge of
			<lb />
			their duties or how good or bad the judiciary has performed, as
			<lb />
			the limited question for consideration of the Court is to identify
			<lb />
			and retain the basic structure of the Constitution in
			<lb />
			appointment of judges.
			<lb />
			The improvement in working of
			<lb />
			existing system of appointment of judges can be the subject
			<lb />
			matter of separate consideration which is being proposed but
			<lb />
			certainly without giving a go bye to the basic features of the
			<lb />
			Constitution of independence of judiciary. In Manoj Narula
			<lb />
			vs. Union of India 783 , question considered was how persons
			<lb />
			with criminal antecedents could be prevented from being
			<lb />
			appointed as Ministers. There was also reference to the
			<lb />
			concern as to how persons with such antecedents could be
			<lb />
			prevented from being legislators.
			<lb />
			This Court held that the
			<lb />
			issue has to be dealt with by those to whom the Constitution
			<lb />
			has entrusted the responsibility and this Court could only
			<lb />
			enforce the constitutional scheme.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			18.11 At this stage, it may be mentioned that the claim of
			<lb />
			learned Attorney General that the Parliament represented the
			<lb />
			will of the people or that the amendment represented the will
			<lb />
			of the people and interference therewith will be undesirable is
			<lb />
			contrary to the law laid down in Kesavananda Bharti case
			<lb />
			(supra) 784 . The will of the people is the Constitution while the
			<lb />
			Parliament represents the will of the majority at a given point
			<lb />
			of time which is subordinate to the Constitution, that is, the
			<lb />
			will of the people. The Constitution was supreme and even
			<lb />
			Parliament has no unlimited amending power.
			<lb />
			Learned
			<lb />
			Attorney General rightly submitted that the last word on the
			<lb />
			validity of a constitutional amendment is of this Court. Even if
			<lb />
			the judiciary is not an elected body, it discharges the
			<lb />
			constitutional functions as per the will of the people reflected
			<lb />
			in the Constitution and the task of determining the powers of
			<lb />
			various constitutional organs is entrusted to the judiciary 785 .
			<lb />
			Conclusion:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			18.12
			<lb />
			Accordingly, I hold that primacy of judiciary and
			<lb />
			limited role of the Executive in appointment of judges is part of
			<lb />
			the basic structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			The primacy of
			<lb />
			judiciary is in initiating a proposal and finalising the same. The
			<lb />
			CJI has the last word in the matter. The Executive is at liberty
			<lb />
			to give suggestions prior to initiation of proposal and to give
			<lb />
			feedback on character and antecedents of the candidates
			<lb />
			proposed and object to the appointment for disclosed reasons
			<lb />
			as held in Second and Third Judges&apos; cases.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			E.
			<lb />
			Whether the Impugned Amendment alters or
			<lb />
			damages the basic structure
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19. In the above background, the only question which
			<lb />
			remains to be considered is whether under the impugned
			<lb />
			amendment the basic feature of primacy of judiciary in
			<lb />
			appointment of judges has been altered or damaged.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19.1 Learned Attorney General submitted that basic
			<lb />
			structure comprises many features like several pillars in a
			<lb />
			foundation, some of which are enumerated in opinions
			<lb />
			rendered in Kesavananda Bharti case. In judging the
			<lb />
			validity of a constitutional amendment, test is whether the
			<lb />
			amendment would lead to collapse of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			Merely affecting or impinging upon an Article embodying a
			<lb />
			feature that is part of the basic structure was not sufficient to
			<lb />
			declare an amendment unconstitutional. Violation of basic
			<lb />
			structure of the constitution must be such that the structure
			<lb />
			itself would collapse. He also relied upon the observations in
			<lb />
			Bhim Singh Ji vs. Union of India 786 particularly the
			<lb />
			following observations :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Therefore, what is a betrayal of the basic feature
			<lb />
			is not a mere violation of Article 14 but a
			<lb />
			shocking,
			<lb />
			unconscionable
			<lb />
			or
			<lb />
			unscrupulous
			<lb />
			travesty of the quintessence of equal justice. If a
			<lb />
			legislation does go that far it shakes the
			<lb />
			democratic foundation and must suffer the death
			<lb />
			penalty. But to permit the Bharati 8 ghost to haunt
			<lb />
			the corridors of the court brandishing fatal writs
			<lb />
			for every feature of inequality is judicial
			<lb />
			paralysation of parliamentary function. Nor can
			<lb />
			the constitutional fascination for the basic
			<lb />
			structure doctrine be made a trojan horse to
			<lb />
			penetrate the entire legislative camp fighting for
			<lb />
			a new social order and to overpower the battle for
			<lb />
			abolition of basic poverty by the &apos;basic structure&apos;
			<lb />
			missile.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			and following observations in Ashoka Kumar Thakur vs.
			<lb />
			Union of India 787 :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;There are large number of provisions in the
			<lb />
			Constitution dealing with the federal character of
			<lb />
			the Constitution. If any one of the provisions is
			<lb />
			altered or modified, that does not amount to the
			<lb />
			alteration of the basic structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			Various fundamental rights are given in the
			<lb />
			Constitution dealing with various aspects of human
			<lb />
			life. The Constitution itself sets out principles for an
			<lb />
			expanding future and is obligated to endure for
			<lb />
			future ages to come and consequently it has to be
			<lb />
			adapted to the various changes that may take
			<lb />
			place in human affairs.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			19.2. Applying the above tests it was submitted that the
			<lb />
			Ninety-Ninth
			<lb />
			Amendment
			<lb />
			was
			<lb />
			consonant
			<lb />
			with
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			strengthens the independence of judiciary while upholding
			<lb />
			the democracy, rule of law and checks and balances. NJAC is
			<lb />
			in sync with the needs of time and is modelled on checks and
			<lb />
			balances to ensure a democratic process with plurality of
			<lb />
			views. NJAC dilutes power of executive in favour of the
			<lb />
			judiciary. He submitted that identity test was required to be
			<lb />
			applied which means that after the amendment the amended
			<lb />
			Constitution loses the identity of the original Constitution.
			<lb />
			There is no bar to making changes and to adopt the
			<lb />
			Constitution to the requirements of changing times without
			<lb />
			touching the foundation or altering the basic constitutional
			<lb />
			pattern. He further relied upon the observations in the
			<lb />
			Indira Gandhi and Minerva Mills Ltd. cases (supra).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19.3 The learned Attorney General further submitted that the
			<lb />
			object of the amendment is to broad base the collegiate body
			<lb />
			so as to provide for participatory and collective role to the
			<lb />
			judiciary, the executive and the civil society. The executive
			<lb />
			has only one member, the Law Minister. The object of having
			<lb />
			the Law Minister is to provide information about the
			<lb />
			candidates which information the other members may not
			<lb />
			have. The eminent persons will be independently appointed
			<lb />
			by a committee comprising of the PM, the CJI and the Leader
			<lb />
			of Opposition. In this way there is no abrogation of
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary. Moreover, three of the six
			<lb />
			members are from the judiciary and thus, the right to reject
			<lb />
			was available to the judges, while the executive alone cannot
			<lb />
			exercise the right to reject. Even in Second Judges&apos; case it
			<lb />
			is observed that the process of appointment is a participatory
			<lb />
			process. An area relating to suitability of candidates such as
			<lb />
			his antecedents and personal character may be better known
			<lb />
			to consultees other than the CJI. The expression, &apos;eminent
			<lb />
			person&apos; is well known and it means distinguished in character
			<lb />
			or attainments or by success in any walk of life. The
			<lb />
			expression &apos;distinguished&apos; is used in Article 124 (3) providing
			<lb />
			for eligibility criteria for judges of the Supreme Court. Since
			<lb />
			the high powered committee comprising three high
			<lb />
			functionaries is to appoint an eminent person, there is
			<lb />
			sufficient safeguard against any uncanalised power. The
			<lb />
			principles of constitutional trust apply to the high powered
			<lb />
			committee which can be trusted to select the most
			<lb />
			appropriate persons. Such eminent persons shall provide
			<lb />
			inputs for the qualities which make a person suitable for
			<lb />
			appointment as a judge. Diversity in composition of the
			<lb />
			Commission will mitigate the danger of cloning. In other
			<lb />
			bodies also there are provisions for non judges. For example,
			<lb />
			Consumer Protection Act. Reservation in favour of minorities,
			<lb />
			women, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and OBC will
			<lb />
			have the effect of sensitizing other members for the problems
			<lb />
			to be faced by these sections. Even in the report of National
			<lb />
			Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution
			<lb />
			(NCRWC), also known as Venkatachalliah Commission, a
			<lb />
			provision for an eminent person was made without
			<lb />
			prescribing any criteria. The eminent person will be guided by
			<lb />
			the CJI, who will be the Chairman and best placed to access
			<lb />
			the legal merit of the candidates. The executive is a key stake
			<lb />
			holder in justice delivery system for which it is accountable to
			<lb />
			the Parliament and it cannot be denied role in appointment of
			<lb />
			judges. Mere possibility of abuse of provision cannot be a
			<lb />
			ground for holding a provision unreasonable. Reliance has
			<lb />
			been placed on Mafat Lal Industries Ltd. vs. Union of
			<lb />
			India 788 which reads as under :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;To the same effect are the observations by
			<lb />
			Khanna, J. in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of
			<lb />
			Kerala (SCR at p. 755 : SCC p. 669). The learned
			<lb />
			Judge said: (SCC p. 821, para 1535)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;In exercising the power of judicial review, the
			<lb />
			Courts cannot be oblivious of the practical needs
			<lb />
			of the government. The door has to be left open
			<lb />
			for trial and error. Constitutional law like other
			<lb />
			mortal contrivances has to take some chances.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Opportunity must be allowed for vindicating
			<lb />
			reasonable belief by experience.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			To the same effect are the observations in T.N.
			<lb />
			Education
			<lb />
			Deptt.
			<lb />
			Ministerial
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			General
			<lb />
			Subordinate Services Assn. v. State of T.N. [(1980)
			<lb />
			3 SCC 97] (SCR at p. 1031) (Krishna Iyer, J.). It is
			<lb />
			equally well-settled that mere possibility of abuse
			<lb />
			of a provision by those in charge of administering
			<lb />
			it cannot be a ground for holding the provision
			<lb />
			procedurally or substantively unreasonable. In
			<lb />
			Collector of Customs v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty
			<lb />
			[ 1962 (3) SCR 786], this Court observed: &quot;The
			<lb />
			possibility of abuse of a statute otherwise valid
			<lb />
			does not impart to it any element of invalidity.&quot; It
			<lb />
			was said in State of Rajasthan v. Union of India
			<lb />
			[(1977) 3 SCC 592] (SCR at p. 77), &quot;it must be
			<lb />
			remembered that merely because power may
			<lb />
			sometimes be abused, it is no ground for denying
			<lb />
			the existence of power. The wisdom of man has
			<lb />
			not yet been able to conceive of a government
			<lb />
			with power sufficient to answer all its legitimate
			<lb />
			needs and at the same time incapable of
			<lb />
			mischief&quot;. (Also see Commr., H.R.E. v. Sri
			<lb />
			Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt
			<lb />
			[ (1954) SCR 1005] (SCR at p. 1030).&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Transparency and accountability in the matter of appointment
			<lb />
			are essential for public confidence in the judiciary. In this
			<lb />
			connection reference has been made to Inderpreet Singh
			<lb />
			Kahlon vs. State of Punjab 789 which reads as under :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;This unfortunate episode teaches us an
			<lb />
			important lesson that before appointing the
			<lb />
			constitutional authorities, there should be a
			<lb />
			thorough and meticulous inquiry and scrutiny
			<lb />
			regarding their antecedents. Integrity and merit
			<lb />
			have to be properly considered and evaluated in
			<lb />
			the appointments to such high positions. It is an
			<lb />
			urgent need of the hour that in such
			<lb />
			appointments absolute transparency is required
			<lb />
			to be maintained and demonstrated. The impact
			<lb />
			of the deeds and misdeeds of the constitutional
			<lb />
			authorities (who are highly placed), affect a very
			<lb />
			large number of people for a very long time,
			<lb />
			therefore, it is absolutely imperative that only
			<lb />
			people of high integrity, merit, rectitude and
			<lb />
			honesty are appointed to these constitutional
			<lb />
			positions.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			19.4 These submissions cannot be accepted. It is obvious that
			<lb />
			pre-dominant role of the judiciary, as it exists in light of
			<lb />
			original Constitutional scheme in taking a final decision on the
			<lb />
			issue of appointment of judges of the Supreme Court and
			<lb />
			appointment and transfer of judges of the High Courts, has
			<lb />
			been given a go bye.
			<lb />
			Under the unamended scheme of
			<lb />
			appointment of judges, which is a basic feature of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, the President is to make appointment, after
			<lb />
			consultation with the CJI representing the judiciary.
			<lb />
			Disregarding the views of the CJI is permissible in exceptional
			<lb />
			situations for recorded reasons having bearing on character
			<lb />
			and antecedents of a candidate and if such reasons are found
			<lb />
			to be acceptable to the CJI. Under the amended scheme, no
			<lb />
			such final view can be taken by the CJI. Without giving any
			<lb />
			reason, the Minister or the nominated members can reject the
			<lb />
			unanimous view of the judges. Chief Justice of the High Court
			<lb />
			is not a member of the Commission and has no Constitutional
			<lb />
			role in appointment/transfer of the judges of the High Courts.
			<lb />
			Mere fact that without the judges, the Minister and the
			<lb />
			nominated members cannot make an appointment is not at
			<lb />
			par with the situation where a decision itself is taken by the CJI
			<lb />
			representing the judiciary. The Constitutional power of the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice of the High Court to initiate proposal for
			<lb />
			appointment as judge of the High Court has been done away
			<lb />
			with, at least as far as the Constitutional provisions are
			<lb />
			concerned.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19.5 The contention that the amendment strengthens the
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary or the democracy or brings about
			<lb />
			transparency or accountability is not shown to be based on any
			<lb />
			logic beyond the words. Even if in appointing two eminent
			<lb />
			members CJI is also a member of the Committee, the fact
			<lb />
			remains that the PM and the Leader of the Opposition have
			<lb />
			significant role in appointing such members, who will have
			<lb />
			power not only equal to the CJI and two senior most judges of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court in making appointment of judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court and appointment/transfer of judges of the High
			<lb />
			Courts but also right to reject the unanimous proposal of the
			<lb />
			CJI and the two senior most judges. Such composition of the
			<lb />
			Commission cannot be held to be conducive to the
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary.
			<lb />
			Appointment of judges of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court and appointment/transfer of judges of the High
			<lb />
			Courts, can certainly be influenced to a great extent by the
			<lb />
			Law Minister and two nominated members, thereby affecting
			<lb />
			the independence of judiciary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19.6 Contention of learned Attorney General that there is a
			<lb />
			presumption that the Law Minister and the nominated
			<lb />
			members will conduct themselves independently and will make
			<lb />
			value addition in selecting the judges in a better way cannot
			<lb />
			be accepted.
			<lb />
			The views of the Constitution makers and
			<lb />
			eminent expert committees clearly show that role of the
			<lb />
			Executive in appointment of judges has to be minimum and by
			<lb />
			and large limited to check the character and antecedents of
			<lb />
			the candidates and not to finally assess the merit and
			<lb />
			suitability of such candidates. In this view of the matter, even
			<lb />
			if the contention that no guideline was required for criteria for
			<lb />
			appointment of eminent persons when the Committee will be
			<lb />
			comprised of high dignitaries is accepted the fact remains that
			<lb />
			such persons will play not merely supporting but pre-dominant
			<lb />
			role in appointing Supreme Court and High Court judges which
			<lb />
			will not be congenial to the independence of judiciary. There is
			<lb />
			no justification for reservation for one of the nominated
			<lb />
			members being from specified categories. Such provision is
			<lb />
			against the scheme of the Constitution and contrary to the
			<lb />
			object of selecting judges purely by merit. The nature of
			<lb />
			appointment does not justify any affirmative action for
			<lb />
			advancement of any socially and educationally backward
			<lb />
			classes or for the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes or
			<lb />
			women. The appointment of judges has to be on evaluation of
			<lb />
			merits and suitability of the candidates. Religion, caste or sex
			<lb />
			of the evaluator has no relevance. The plea that the Law
			<lb />
			Minister and the nominated members will provide feed back
			<lb />
			also does not provide any justification for their being members
			<lb />
			of the Commission and thereby participating in evaluation and
			<lb />
			suitability of a candidate for appointment as judge of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court or High Courts and having power to overrule
			<lb />
			unanimous view of judges. The appointment of a judge of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court is normally made out of Chief Justices of High
			<lb />
			Courts or senior judges or eminent lawyers or eminent jurists
			<lb />
			whose merit is better known to senior judges. Their evaluation
			<lb />
			has to be impartial and free from any political or other
			<lb />
			considerations. Persons making selection are required to be
			<lb />
			best placed to assess their merit and suitability. Pre-dominant
			<lb />
			and decisive role of the judiciary is a requirement not only of
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary and separation of powers but also
			<lb />
			for inspiring confidence of the people at large necessary for
			<lb />
			strength of the Democracy. The citizens having a grievance of
			<lb />
			violation of their fundamental and legal rights against the
			<lb />
			Executive or the Legislature expect that their grievance is
			<lb />
			considered by persons whose appointments are not influenced
			<lb />
			by the Executive or the Legislature. If an appointment is
			<lb />
			perceived as being influenced by political consideration or any
			<lb />
			other extraneous influence, faith in impartiality, which is hall
			<lb />
			mark of independence of judiciary, will be eroded. The scheme
			<lb />
			in other countries cannot be mechanically followed when it is
			<lb />
			in conflict with the basic scheme of the Indian Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19.7 In this regard, it may be recalled that the word
			<lb />
			amendment literally means betterment or improvement and
			<lb />
			sponsor of amendment may always claim improvement. Such
			<lb />
			claim has to be tested by applying the &apos;identity test&apos; and the
			<lb />
			&apos;impact test&apos;. The said tests have already been mentioned in
			<lb />
			the earlier part of its opinion. The amendment should not
			<lb />
			affect the identity of an essential feature of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			The impact of the amendment on the working of the scheme of
			<lb />
			the Constitution has to be taken into account 790 . This brings to
			<lb />
			some extent subjective element which is unavoidable even
			<lb />
			while testing any legislation which is alleged to be violative of
			<lb />
			fundamental rights and justified on the concept of &apos;reasonable
			<lb />
			restrictions&apos; 791 . In this regard, effect of Executive interference
			<lb />
			which has been documented by expert studies cannot be held
			<lb />
			to be irrelevant or ignored on the ground that this is a subject
			<lb />
			of wisdom of Parliament. As already mentioned, the working of
			<lb />
			the Judiciary has affected the Executive and Legislature on
			<lb />
			several occasions, including (by way of illustration) Privy
			<lb />
			Purses case 792 , Bank Nationalisation Case 793 , Freedom of
			<lb />
			Press case 794 , Kesavananda Bharati case (supra), Indira
			<lb />
			Gandhi case (supra), Minerva Mills case (supra), L.
			<lb />
			Chandrakumar case (supra), M. Nagaraj case (supra),
			<lb />
			I.R. Coelho case (supra), S.R. Bommai case 795 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19.8 The new structure provides for decisive voice with the
			<lb />
			Commission which apart from judges comprises of Law
			<lb />
			Minister and two eminent persons to be nominated by a
			<lb />
			specified committee. Before examining the said structure, it
			<lb />
			may be noted that it is not merely the text of the amendment
			<lb />
			but also its impact and potential which has to be kept in mind
			<lb />
			on &apos;identity&apos; of the original scheme and the &apos;width&apos; of the
			<lb />
			power under the new scheme 796 . In a similar context when an
			<lb />
			alternative judicial forum was sought to be created to deal with
			<lb />
			the company matters in place of High Courts, this Court held
			<lb />
			that the concept of rule of law required that the new
			<lb />
			mechanism should, as nearly as possible, have same
			<lb />
			standards 797 . Same view was taken in the context of setting up
			<lb />
			of National Tax Tribunals to substitute the jurisdiction of the
			<lb />
			High Courts in tax matters 798 . The new scheme may iron out
			<lb />
			792 Madhav Rao Jivaji Rao Scindia vs. UOI [1971 (1) SCC 85],
			<lb />
			793 Rustom Cavasjee Cooper vs. Union of India [1970 (1) SCC 248]
			<lb />
			794 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd. vs. Union of India [1972 (2) SCC 788]

			<lb />
			substituted scheme.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19.9 As already mentioned under the unamended scheme, as
			<lb />
			authoritatively interpreted by this Court, power of initiating a
			<lb />
			proposal was always with the judiciary. At the time of making
			<lb />
			of the Constitution, the draft of the Constitution was circulated
			<lb />
			to the Federal Court and High Courts to elicit views of the
			<lb />
			judges. In the memorandum representing the views of the
			<lb />
			judges, it was mentioned that the existing convention was that
			<lb />
			appointment of judges was made after referring the matter to
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice and obtaining his concurrence 799 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19.10
			<lb />
			In CAD, various models were considered but the
			<lb />
			system applicable in other countries providing for final say of
			<lb />
			the Executive or concurrence of Legislature (as in UK and USA)
			<lb />
			were found to be unsuitable. It was stated by Dr. Ambedkar
			<lb />
			that the power could not be left to be exercised on the advice
			<lb />
			of the Executive or be made subject to concurrence of the
			<lb />
			Legislature. It was further stated that the Chief Justice could
			<lb />
			also not be given a veto upon the appointment of judges 800 .
			<lb />
			The Law Commission in its 14 th Report criticised the
			<lb />
			interference by the Executive in appointment of judges. The
			<lb />
			matter came up for discussion before the Parliament and the
			<lb />
			Home Minister and the Law Minister made a statement that all
			<lb />
			appointments were made on the recommendation of the CJI as
			<lb />
			the CJI was familiar with the merits of the candidates. Out of
			<lb />
			211, 210 appointments were made with the consent and
			<lb />
			concurrence of the CJI 801 . It was noted that the procedure for
			<lb />
			appointment of judges applicable prior to Second Judge&apos;s
			<lb />
			case was that a proposal for appointment was initiated by the
			<lb />
			CJI in case of the Supreme Court and by Chief Justice of the
			<lb />
			High Court in case of the High Court Judges 802 .
			<lb />
			This
			<lb />
			mechanism was held to be a part of the convention 803 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19.11
			<lb />
			In Shamsher Singh case (supra) this Court
			<lb />
			observed that in practice the last word in matters of judiciary
			<lb />
			must belong to the CJI. The same view was expressed in
			<lb />
			Sankalchand case (supra) in the context of transfer of
			<lb />
			judges 804 . In 80 th Report of the Law Commission headed by
			<lb />
			Justice H.R. Khanna, J. (1979), a Commission was proposed
			<lb />
			with a pre-dominant voice of judiciary to deal with the
			<lb />
			appointment and transfer of judges.
			<lb />
			The Report was
			<lb />
			significant in the background of supersession of judges in
			<lb />
			appointment of the CJI and selective transfer of judges which
			<lb />
			were perceived to be interference with the independence of
			<lb />
			judiciary. However, contrary to the said recommendations, a
			<lb />
			circular was issued by the Law Minister in
			<lb />
			1981
			<lb />
			Debates reproduced in Paras 362 -368 in Second Judges&apos; case
			<lb />
			Para 98 Second Judges&apos; case
			<lb />
			Para 370, Kuldip Singh, J. and Para 505, Punchhi, J. in Second Judges&apos; case
			<lb />
			Paras 39, 41 Chandrachud, J.; 50-52 Bhagwati, J.; 103, 115 Krishna Iyer, J.,
			<lb />
			Page 994
			<lb />
			proposing transfer of judges and making appointment of
			<lb />
			judges for short period which itself was perceived to be
			<lb />
			interference with the independence of judiciary and was
			<lb />
			challenged in First Judges&apos; case. As already mentioned, the
			<lb />
			majority held that primacy in such matters rested with the
			<lb />
			Central Government 805 . The said view was subject matter of
			<lb />
			severe criticism.
			<lb />
			Eminent constitutional expert Seervai
			<lb />
			commented that the Executive was not qualified to assess the
			<lb />
			merits or demerits of a candidate. Initiation of a proposal by
			<lb />
			the Executive was against the intention of the framers of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. Political, Executive or Legislative pressure should
			<lb />
			not enter into the appointment of a judge 806 .
			<lb />
			The Law
			<lb />
			Commission headed by Justice D.A. Desai in its 121 st Report
			<lb />
			also criticised the system where the Executive had overriding
			<lb />
			powers in the matter of appointment of judges. He stated that
			<lb />
			power to appoint and transfer judges of superior courts by the
			<lb />
			Executive affects independence of judiciary and is not
			<lb />
			conducive to its healthy growth. He recommended a Judicial
			<lb />
			Commission to check the arbitrariness on the part of the
			<lb />
			Executive in such appointments and transfers 807 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19.12
			<lb />
			The interpretation in the Second Judge&apos;s case
			<lb />
			was in the above historical background. In the context of
			<lb />
			Para 30 -First Judges&apos; case
			<lb />
			Seervai, 4 th Edition, Constitutional Law of India -Paras 25.350, 25.353 and 25.354
			<lb />
			Para 7.5 and 7.8 -121 st Report of the Law Commission
			<lb />
			working of the Indian Constitution, the dominant role of the
			<lb />
			Executive in appointment of judges adversely affected the
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary. The judiciary is assigned important
			<lb />
			role for upholding the rule of law and democracy.
			<lb />
			Its
			<lb />
			independence and its power of judicial review are part of basic
			<lb />
			structure. Primacy of judiciary in appointment of judges is part
			<lb />
			of basic structure. In this background question is whether the
			<lb />
			new scheme retains the said primacy of judiciary in
			<lb />
			appointment of judges.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19.13
			<lb />
			Under the new scheme, the Law Minister has been
			<lb />
			given role equal to the CJI. Right from the commencement of
			<lb />
			the Constitution, this role of the Law Minister was never
			<lb />
			envisaged while initiating the process and finalizing it. Law
			<lb />
			Minister, in participatory scheme, could at best suggest a
			<lb />
			name or give his comments on the names proposed but the
			<lb />
			proposal could and was always initiated by the CJI. At the
			<lb />
			stage of initiation, if equal authority is conferred, this will erode
			<lb />
			the primacy of judiciary as declared by this Court
			<lb />
			authoritatively. Any deviation in the past was always adversely
			<lb />
			commented upon and held to be undesirable amounting to
			<lb />
			interference with the independence of judiciary 808 . Other two
			<lb />
			persons to be nominated by a Committee which also has
			<lb />
			predominant political voice to be placed at par with the CJI in
			<lb />
			initiating and finalizing a proposal destroys the original scheme
			<lb />
			beyond its identity. Any suggestion before initiation of a name
			<lb />
			or feedback even after initiation may be useful and may not
			<lb />
			affect independence of judiciary but equal participation by the
			<lb />
			Law Minister and two outsiders in final decision for initiation or
			<lb />
			appointment can be detrimental to the independence of
			<lb />
			judiciary. It cannot be wished away by presuming that the Law
			<lb />
			Minister and the two distributors will not be influenced by any
			<lb />
			extraneous consideration. Such a presumption will be contrary
			<lb />
			to the acknowledged factual experience. It will also be against
			<lb />
			the concept of separation of judiciary from the Executive.
			<lb />
			More over this will be contrary to the basic intention of the
			<lb />
			Constitution makers. The amendment is not an insignificant
			<lb />
			amendment and is not within the basic framework of the
			<lb />
			working of the Constitution. The very premise and object of
			<lb />
			the amendment as reflected in the Statement of Objects and
			<lb />
			Reasons and the stand of the Union of India in its pleadings
			<lb />
			and during the course of arguments is that the primacy of
			<lb />
			judiciary was evolved by erroneous interpretation which is
			<lb />
			sought to be corrected. It is stated that the primacy of judiciary
			<lb />
			was undemocratic and denied the Executive a meaningful role.
			<lb />
			These reasons are untenable for reasons already discussed.
			<lb />
			As regards the plea of transparency and accountability, the
			<lb />
			same has to be achieved without compromising independence
			<lb />
			of judiciary. If on the perceived plea of transparency and
			<lb />
			accountability, the independence of judiciary is sought to be
			<lb />
			adversely affected by the Amendment, this will cause severe
			<lb />
			damage to the functioning of the Constitution. The primacy of
			<lb />
			judiciary, as already noticed, is integral to the independence of
			<lb />
			judiciary, separation of powers, federalism and democracy,
			<lb />
			rule of law and supremacy of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			amendment does away with the primacy of even unanimous
			<lb />
			opinion of the judicial members as such opinion is not enough
			<lb />
			to finalise an appointment. While Shri Venugopal has rightly
			<lb />
			stated in his alternative submission that primacy of judiciary is
			<lb />
			part of judicial independence and if Executive has
			<lb />
			pre-dominant voice, it could subvert independence of judiciary,
			<lb />
			his submission that the situation could be retrieved by giving
			<lb />
			the suggested interpretation cannot be accepted.
			<lb />
			Such
			<lb />
			interpretation is not warranted by the text of the amendment
			<lb />
			or by the principles of interpretation. It is difficult to hold that
			<lb />
			primacy of judiciary is still retained as a wrong proposal can
			<lb />
			still be stalled by any two members, including two judges. The
			<lb />
			primacy of judiciary as always understood in binding judicial
			<lb />
			precedents comprises of initiation of name and taking a final
			<lb />
			call 809 . These two core features constitute identity of the
			<lb />
			primacy of judiciary. Subject to these two features, any
			<lb />
			amendment could have been made and if these two features
			<lb />
			are compromised, the basic identity of the Constitution can be
			<lb />
			held to have been altered or damaged.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19.14
			<lb />
			There can be no doubt about the propositions
			<lb />
			forcefully canvassed by the respondents that the legislative
			<lb />
			wisdom of the choice of the Parliament was not open to
			<lb />
			question and that possibility of abuse of power could not affect
			<lb />
			the existence and exercise of power but these submissions
			<lb />
			cannot ignore the limitation of basic features. Examining
			<lb />
			whether basic feature was sought to be altered, is different
			<lb />
			from questioning the wisdom of the Parliament. It is testing
			<lb />
			the power of Parliament conferred by the Constitution.
			<lb />
			Similarly determining whether the new mechanism complied
			<lb />
			with the framework of the Constitution is different from the
			<lb />
			issue of possibility of abuse. In the present case, question is of
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary which implies having judges not
			<lb />
			influenced by any political consideration as per the intention of
			<lb />
			framers of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			Even assuming the best of
			<lb />
			intention, can the power of judicial review by the constitutional
			<lb />
			courts be subjected to scrutiny by any &apos;eminent persons&apos; on
			<lb />
			the ground that working of the judiciary was perceived to be
			<lb />
			unsatisfactory. Obviously it will be clear interference with
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary 810 .
			<lb />
			Same way, constitutionally
			<lb />
			conferred judicial primacy in appointment of judges cannot be
			<lb />
			whittled down or sought to be controlled by those who are not
			<lb />
			given or allowed to take over such functions. Even granting
			<lb />
			the best of intentions, the Parliament could not act beyond the
			<lb />
			authority conferred on it by the Constitution. Thus, taking
			<lb />
			away primacy of judiciary or conferring such primacy on a
			<lb />
			body which is not at par with the said concept is certainly not a
			<lb />
			choice available with the Parliament. As already mentioned,
			<lb />
			the concept of primacy of judiciary comprises of initiating the
			<lb />
			proposal and taking a final decision in case any adverse feed
			<lb />
			back is received after the proposal is initiated. This concept of
			<lb />
			primacy is compromised if the judiciary is unable to initiate a
			<lb />
			proposal in the first instance or if such proposal can be
			<lb />
			effectively rejected.
			<lb />
			The impact thereof being that the
			<lb />
			appointment of judges could be made under the influence of
			<lb />
			the Executive represented by the Law Minister or the
			<lb />
			non-judge members in whose appointment the pre-dominant
			<lb />
			voice is not of the judiciary. The impact of such appointments
			<lb />
			will be that the judges appointed will owe their appointments
			<lb />
			to the Executive which may be destructive of the public
			<lb />
			confidence and impartiality of judiciary and adversely affect
			<lb />
			the role of the judiciary as an important impartial
			<lb />
			constitutional organ. As already noted, the role of the judiciary
			<lb />
			is to define and regulate working of other constitutional
			<lb />
			authorities within the scope of roles assigned to them 811 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19.15 If the amendment had merely provided for advisory or
			<lb />
			recommendatory role to the Law Minister or the non-judicial
			<lb />
			members with the professed object of transparency and
			<lb />
			accountability, the situation may have been different. It may
			<lb />
			not have, in that case, interfered with the primacy of the
			<lb />
			judiciary in appointment of judges which is the mandate of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
			Such power cannot be justified under the
			<lb />
			doctrine of wisdom of Parliament nor on the principles of trust
			<lb />
			once such power is in violation of principle of primacy of
			<lb />
			judiciary in appointment of judges. No individual instance
			<lb />
			either of working of the Executive or Legislature or the existing
			<lb />
			system of appointment of judges need be discussed as the
			<lb />
			issue involved here is of interpretation of the Constitution and
			<lb />
			not of success or failure of any individual or persons. As
			<lb />
			already mentioned, the shortcomings in working of every
			<lb />
			institution may need to be removed by constant efforts
			<lb />
			constitutionally permissible but cannot justify the altering of
			<lb />
			the framework of the Constitution or the same being damaged.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			20. Reference may now be made to the submission of
			<lb />
			learned counsel for the respondents that in many countries
			<lb />
			without primacy of judiciary in appointment of judges,
			<lb />
			independent judiciary is functioning and thus unfettered
			<lb />
			judicial primacy was inconsistent with the international trend.
			<lb />
			Particular mention has been made of 15 countries, namely,
			<lb />
			Kenya, Pakistan, South Africa, UK, Israel, France, Italy, Nigeria,
			<lb />
			Sri Lanka, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Bangladesh,
			<lb />
			Germany and United States.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			20.1 The submission of learned Attorney General in relation
			<lb />
			to judicial appointments in the said 15 countries is as
			<lb />
			follows :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;a.
			<lb />
			9 countries conduct appointment of
			<lb />
			judges through either judicial appointment
			<lb />
			commissions (Kenya, Pakistan, South Africa and
			<lb />
			UK), committees (Israel) or councils (France, Italy,
			<lb />
			Nigeria and Sir Lanka); 4 countries appoint judges
			<lb />
			through a direct order of the Governor General
			<lb />
			(Australia, Canada, New Zealand) or the President
			<lb />
			(Bangladesh), where applicable; 1 (Germany)
			<lb />
			follows a multi-stage process of nomination by the
			<lb />
			Minister of Justice, confirmation by Parliamentary
			<lb />
			Committees and final appointment by the
			<lb />
			President; and 1 (United States) follows a process
			<lb />
			of nomination by the President (executive) and
			<lb />
			confirmation by the Senate (legislature).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			b. In all 15 countries, the executive is the final or
			<lb />
			determinative appointing authority. Out of the 9
			<lb />
			countries with commissions, in 2 countries (South
			<lb />
			Africa and Sri Lanka) the executive has absolute
			<lb />
			majority in comparison with members of other
			<lb />
			groups (judiciary, legislature and independent
			<lb />
			persons). In 4 countries (France, Israel, Kenya
			<lb />
			and UK) there is a balanced representation of
			<lb />
			various stakeholders, including the executive.
			<lb />
			Out of 3 countries where the number of judges
			<lb />
			are in a majority (Italy, Nigeria and Pakistan), in 2
			<lb />
			countries (Nigeria and Pakistan) the decision of
			<lb />
			the commission is subject to the vote of a
			<lb />
			parliamentary committee/Senate, while in 1
			<lb />
			(Italy), the President of the Republic is the final
			<lb />
			appointing authority and the chairman of the
			<lb />
			judicial appointment body. In 5 of the countries
			<lb />
			without commissions (Canada, Australia, New
			<lb />
			Zealand, Bangladesh and United States of
			<lb />
			America), the decision is taken by the Executive
			<lb />
			without any formal process of consultation with
			<lb />
			the judiciary, while in 1 (Germany), the
			<lb />
			appointment process is conducted by the
			<lb />
			Parliament, and later confirmed by the President.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			c. In 8 countries (France, Israel, Italy, Kenya,
			<lb />
			Nigeria, Pakistan, South Africa and UK) with
			<lb />
			bodies for judicial appointments, independent
			<lb />
			members have a mandated role in the selection
			<lb />
			process through representation on the said
			<lb />
			bodies.
			<lb />
			In 4 countries where independent
			<lb />
			members do not play a formal role in the
			<lb />
			appointment process (Canada, USA, Australia and
			<lb />
			New Zealand), the appointing authority (body or
			<lb />
			person) consults independent members at various
			<lb />
			stages of the appointment process for their
			<lb />
			feedback on the selection or recommendation of a
			<lb />
			prospective
			<lb />
			candidate.
			<lb />
			In
			<lb />
			3
			<lb />
			countries
			<lb />
			(Bangladesh, Germany and Sri Lanka) no
			<lb />
			documented
			<lb />
			process
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			consultation
			<lb />
			with
			<lb />
			independent members is provided for.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			20.2 Learned counsel for the respondents also referred to
			<lb />
			criticism of the collegium system by some jurists including the
			<lb />
			eminent jurist Shri Nariman, appearing in the present case for
			<lb />
			the petitioners.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			20.3 On the other hand, Shri Nariman opposed the above
			<lb />
			submissions and referred to decisions of this Court particularly
			<lb />
			Kesavananda Bharti case, Indira Gandhi case and
			<lb />
			Minerva Mills case, where the Constitution amendments
			<lb />
			were struck down. He also referred to expert studies including
			<lb />
			reports of the 14 th and 121 st Law Commissions and the National
			<lb />
			Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution
			<lb />
			(NCRWC), headed by Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah (retired CJI),
			<lb />
			wherein it was observed that independence of judiciary was
			<lb />
			basic feature of the Constitution and composition of a National
			<lb />
			Commission was required to be consistent with the concept of
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary. Method of appointment of judges
			<lb />
			could not be altered in such a way as may impinge upon the
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary.
			<lb />
			Composition of a Judicial
			<lb />
			Commission has to uphold the primacy of judiciary. 812
			<lb />
			20.4 Shri Nariman also submitted that the impugned
			<lb />
			amendment was introduced in response to decisions of this
			<lb />
			Court affecting certain legislators. He submitted that
			<lb />
			independent functioning of the
			<lb />
			judiciary often comes in
			<lb />
			conflict with the Executive and the Legislature but mandate of
			<lb />
			the Constitution of upholding the independence of judiciary
			<lb />
			was necessary to inspire faith of citizens in impartial justice
			<lb />
			and to uphold the constitutional values like the Rule of law and
			<lb />
			the Democracy, by upholding protection of fundamental rights
			<lb />
			even against the State. He particularly made reference to the
			<lb />
			history of proposed Forty-Fifth Amendment vide Bill 88 of 1978
			<lb />
			to provide in Article 368 that an Amendment compromising the
			<lb />
			independence of judiciary could be made by approval by
			<lb />
			majority at a referendum. The same was brought about by the
			<lb />
			Janta Government led by leaders who were arrested during
			<lb />
			emergency. It was not approved for want of majority in Rajya
			<lb />
			Sabha. He also referred to decisions of this Court Lily Thomas
			<lb />
			vs. Union of India 813 and Chief Election Commissioner
			<lb />
			vs. Jan Chaukidar 814 holding that a member of a Legislature
			<lb />
			will stand qualified on conviction and that a person confined in
			<lb />
			jail could not contest an election and efforts to undo such
			<lb />
			decisions.
			<lb />
			He also referred to the treatise, Constitutional
			<lb />
			Law of India by Seervai,
			<lb />
			4 th Edition, to the effect
			<lb />
			that the decision of First Judges&apos; case put the judicial
			<lb />
			independence at the mercy of the Executive 815 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			20.5
			<lb />
			He also gave a personal note, in response to reliance
			<lb />
			on behalf of the respondents on his own biography &quot;Before
			<lb />
			Memory Fades&quot; as follows:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;I have been, and I continue to be, a supporter of
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			&quot;Judicial-Appointment-Commission-system&quot;
			<lb />
			and so are my clients whom I represent (this is so
			<lb />
			stated in the Writ Petition at page 26 to 31, and
			<lb />
			44 to 45). BUT I am definitely opposed to a
			<lb />
			pretence of a Judicial Appointments Commission -
			<lb />
			which in reality is not judicial, only partly or quasi
			<lb />
			judicial. The &quot;Judicial Appointments Commission
			<lb />
			system&quot; (so called) as embodied in the 99 th
			<lb />
			Constitutional Amendment, 2014 and along with
			<lb />
			the NJAC Act, 2014, is opposed BECAUSE is not in
			<lb />
			accordance with and does not conform to the
			<lb />
			Beijing Principles on Independence of the Judiciary
			<lb />
			(by which we in India are governed).
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			principles were formulated after long deliberation
			<lb />
			by Heads of the Judiciary in the LAWASIA region
			<lb />
			(including India&apos;s Chief Justice) -who are all
			<lb />
			signatories to the Beijing Principle. Principles
			<lb />
			No.15 reads as follows:-
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;15. In some societies, the appointment
			<lb />
			of judges, by, with the consent of, or
			<lb />
			after consultation with a Judicial Services
			<lb />
			Commission has been seen as a means
			<lb />
			of ensuring that those chosen judges are
			<lb />
			appropriate for the purpose. Where a
			<lb />
			Judicial Services Commission is adopted,
			<lb />
			it should include representatives of the
			<lb />
			higher Judiciary and the independent
			<lb />
			legal profession as a means of ensuring
			<lb />
			that judicial competence, integrity and
			<lb />
			independence are maintained.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Note -NOT OUTSIDERS, not representatives of the
			<lb />
			EXECUTIVE: because this is not helpful in the
			<lb />
			interests of maintaining the INDEPENDENCE OF THE
			<lb />
			JUDICIARY. Text of Beijing Principles are
			<lb />
			annexed as Exhibit-II.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			The then Law Minister had stated in Parliament,
			<lb />
			when these measures were first introduced, that he
			<lb />
			had consulted named persons including myself -
			<lb />
			and as to what I said is accurately recorded in the
			<lb />
			Minutes of the Meeting prepared by the office of
			<lb />
			the Law Minister. This is what the minutes record:
			<lb />
			-
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Constitutional Expert and Senior
			<lb />
			Advocate, Shri Fali Nariman stated that it
			<lb />
			is
			<lb />
			important
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			remember
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			independence of the judiciary and the
			<lb />
			separation of powers.
			<lb />
			The basic
			<lb />
			structure doctrine as laid down by the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in the Keshavananda
			<lb />
			Bharti case could not be violated and any
			<lb />
			proposal for appointment of judges must
			<lb />
			be in conformity with the basic structure.
			<lb />
			He felt that the Government should
			<lb />
			consider following the model of the
			<lb />
			Appointments Commission as suggested
			<lb />
			by the Justice Venkatchaliah Commission
			<lb />
			that gave dominance to the judiciary in
			<lb />
			the appointment process. He stated that
			<lb />
			composition of the Commission is the
			<lb />
			basic issue, and a Commission with
			<lb />
			non-Judge domination would not be
			<lb />
			viable in India.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			…………………..&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			21. As already mentioned, the Constitution of India has its
			<lb />
			own background and personality 816 .
			<lb />
			Models of other
			<lb />
			countries could not be blindly followed so as to damage the
			<lb />
			identity and personality of the Indian Constitution. The
			<lb />
			Judicial Commissions referred to by learned Attorney General
			<lb />
			do not show the trend of reducing the pre-existing role of
			<lb />
			judiciary. In fact, the trend is for reducing the pre-existing role
			<lb />
			of the Executive. In the impugned amendment it is the
			<lb />
			reverse.
			<lb />
			Thus, the contention of working of other
			<lb />
			Constitutions or setting up of judicial Commissions with
			<lb />
			varying compositions in other countries does not justify the
			<lb />
			impugned amendment which is contrary to the basic
			<lb />
			structure of the Indian Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			22. There is also no merit in the contention that in the
			<lb />
			present case mere alteration in a constitutional provision
			<lb />
			does not amount to damage of a basic feature. It is not a
			<lb />
			case of simple amendment to iron out creases. Its impact
			<lb />
			clearly affects the independence of judiciary. As already
			<lb />
			mentioned, appointment of judges has always been
			<lb />
			considered in the scheme of the working of the Indian
			<lb />
			Constitution to be integral to the independence of judiciary.
			<lb />
			It is for this reason that primacy in appointment of judges has
			<lb />
			always been intended to be of the judiciary. Pre-dominant
			<lb />
			role of the Executive is not permissible.
			<lb />
			Such primacy
			<lb />
			comprises of initiating the proposal by the judiciary and final
			<lb />
			word being normally with the CJI (in representative capacity).
			<lb />
			This scheme is beyond the power of amendment available to
			<lb />
			the Parliament.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			22.1 In the new scheme, the Chief Justices of the High Courts
			<lb />
			have not been provided any constitutional say. The Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of the High Court is in a better position to initially
			<lb />
			assess the merit of a candidate for appointment as judge of
			<lb />
			the High Court.
			<lb />
			The constitutional amendment does not
			<lb />
			provide for any role to the Chief Minister of the State. This
			<lb />
			may affect the quality of the candidate selected and thereby
			<lb />
			the independence of judiciary. The statutory provision in the
			<lb />
			NJAC Act will be gone into separately.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			22.2 The contention of learned Attorney General that the
			<lb />
			amendment was justified to uphold the principles of checks
			<lb />
			and balances and transparency which were equally important
			<lb />
			constitutional values cannot be accepted. Even assuming that
			<lb />
			there is a scope for improvement in the working of the
			<lb />
			collegium system, it cannot be held that under the existing
			<lb />
			system there is no transparency or checks and balances. The
			<lb />
			procedure laid down in memoranda issued by the Central
			<lb />
			Government has been noted in the earlier part of this opinion.
			<lb />
			All proceedings in initiating a proposal are in writing and are
			<lb />
			forwarded to the constitutional functionaries.
			<lb />
			The Chief
			<lb />
			Minister, the Governor, the Law Minister, the PM and the
			<lb />
			President have opportunity to give their views in the matter of
			<lb />
			appointment of Chief Justices and Judges of High Courts apart
			<lb />
			from judges and non-judges involved in the process. The Law
			<lb />
			Minister, the PM and the President also have opportunity to
			<lb />
			give their comment on appointment of CJI and the Judges of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court. There is also an opportunity to suggest
			<lb />
			names before initiation of proposal. There is no bar to an
			<lb />
			expert feedback from the civil society through the
			<lb />
			constitutional functionaries involved.
			<lb />
			Thus, there is
			<lb />
			transparency as well as checks and balances.
			<lb />
			These
			<lb />
			considerations do not justify interference with the final
			<lb />
			initiation of proposal by the judiciary or in taking a final view in
			<lb />
			the matter by the judiciary, consistent with the mandate of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			22.3 Learned Attorney General sought to compare the existing
			<lb />
			provision for veto by two members of collegium in
			<lb />
			appointment of Supreme Court Judges as per Third Judges&apos;
			<lb />
			case to justify veto under Section 6 (6).
			<lb />
			As already
			<lb />
			mentioned, the role of the Law Minister and the non-judge
			<lb />
			members cannot be placed at par with the Chief Justice and
			<lb />
			Judges of the Supreme Court. They cannot be compared for
			<lb />
			obvious reasons. The veto power with the Law Minister or with
			<lb />
			a non-judge members, as against a Supreme Court Judge who
			<lb />
			is the member of the collegium, may involve interference with
			<lb />
			the independence of judiciary.
			<lb />
			Similarly, requirement of
			<lb />
			special majority in any other ordinary situation was not
			<lb />
			comparable with the scheme of appointment of judges which is
			<lb />
			sui generis. Similarly, the plea of giving vital inputs does not
			<lb />
			justify participation of the non-judge members with the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice and the Judges in discharging their functions of
			<lb />
			initiating a proposal or taking a final view. Though, formal act
			<lb />
			of appointment of judges may be an executive function, there
			<lb />
			is a unique judicial element in the process of appointment of
			<lb />
			judges of constitutional courts. The criticism against perceived
			<lb />
			short comings in the working of the collegium also does not
			<lb />
			justify the impugned provisions. As already observed, there
			<lb />
			may be criticism even against discharging of judicial functions
			<lb />
			by the aggrieved parties or otherwise. But that does not
			<lb />
			justify interference with the judicial decisions 817 . Needless to
			<lb />
			say that criticism can be against the working of any system
			<lb />
			but the systems can be changed only as per the Constitution.
			<lb />
			Efforts to improve all systems have to be continuously made.
			<lb />
			Conclusion:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			22.4 I would conclude that the new scheme damages the
			<lb />
			basic feature of the Constitution under which primacy in
			<lb />
			appointment of judges has to be with the judiciary. Under the
			<lb />
			new scheme such primacy has been given a go-bye. Thus
			<lb />
			the impugned amendment cannot be sustained.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			F.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Validity of the NJAC Act
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			23. In view of my conclusion about the amendment being
			<lb />
			beyond the competence of the Parliament, I do not consider it
			<lb />
			necessary to discuss the validity of the NJAC Act in great
			<lb />
			detail as the said Act cannot survive once the amendment is
			<lb />
			struck down. However, consistent with my earlier view that
			<lb />
			primacy of judiciary in appointment of judges cannot be
			<lb />
			compromised and on that ground not only Section 2 of the
			<lb />
			Amendment dispensing with the mandatory consultation with
			<lb />
			the judiciary as contemplated under the unamended
			<lb />
			provisions, Section 3 conferring power on the NJAC (under
			<lb />
			Article 124B) and providing for composition of the
			<lb />
			Commission under Article 124A giving a role to the Law
			<lb />
			Minister and two eminent persons equal to the CJI in
			<lb />
			recommending appointments as CJI, Judges of Supreme
			<lb />
			Court, Chief Justices and other Judges of the High Courts and
			<lb />
			recommending transfer of Chief Justices and Judges of the
			<lb />
			High Courts are unconstitutional but also Article 124C giving
			<lb />
			power to the Parliament to regulate the procedure and to lay
			<lb />
			down the manner of selection was also unconstitutional, the
			<lb />
			impugned Act has to be struck down. It goes far beyond the
			<lb />
			procedural aspects. In Section 5 (2) &apos;suitability criteria&apos; is left
			<lb />
			to be worked out by regulations. Second proviso to Section 5
			<lb />
			(2) and Section 6 (6) give veto to two members of the
			<lb />
			Commission which is not contemplated by the Amendment.
			<lb />
			Section 5 (3) and Section 6 (8) provide for conditions for
			<lb />
			selection to be laid down by regulations which are not mere
			<lb />
			procedural
			<lb />
			matters.
			<lb />
			Section
			<lb />
			6
			<lb />
			authorises
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			recommendations for appointment as judges of the High
			<lb />
			Courts without the proposal being first initiated by the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of the High Court. Section
			<lb />
			6 (1) provides for
			<lb />
			recommendation for appointment of Chief Justice of a High
			<lb />
			Court on the basis of inter se seniority of High Court Judges.
			<lb />
			This may affect giving representation to as many High Courts
			<lb />
			as viable as, in inter se seniority, many judges of only one
			<lb />
			High Court may be senior most. Section 6 (2) provides for
			<lb />
			seeking nomination from Chief Justices of High Courts, but
			<lb />
			Section 6 (3) empowers the Commission itself to make
			<lb />
			recommendation for appointment as Judge of the High Court
			<lb />
			and seek comments from Chief Justice after short listing the
			<lb />
			candidates by itself.
			<lb />
			Section 8 enables the Central
			<lb />
			Government to appoint officers and employees of the
			<lb />
			Commission and to lay down their conditions of service. The
			<lb />
			Secretary of the Government is the Convenor of the
			<lb />
			Commission.
			<lb />
			Section 13 requires all regulations to be
			<lb />
			approved by the Parliament. These provisions in the Act
			<lb />
			impinge upon the independence of judiciary. Even if the
			<lb />
			doctrine of basic structure is not applied in judging the
			<lb />
			validity of a parliamentary statute, independence of judiciary
			<lb />
			and rule of law are parts of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution and absence of independence of judiciary affects
			<lb />
			the said Fundamental Rights. The NJAC Act is thus liable to
			<lb />
			be struck down.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			G.
			<lb />
			Effect of Amendment being struck down
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			24. The contention that even if Amendment is held to be
			<lb />
			void, the pre-existing system cannot be restored has no logic.
			<lb />
			In exercise of power of judicial review, a provision can be
			<lb />
			declared void in which case the legal position as it stands
			<lb />
			without such void provision can be held to prevail. It is not a
			<lb />
			situation when position has not been made clear while
			<lb />
			deciding an issue. Power of this Court to declare the effect of
			<lb />
			its order cannot be doubted nor the decisions relied upon by
			<lb />
			the respondents show otherwise. I hold that on amendment
			<lb />
			being struck down, the pre-existing system stands revived.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			H.
			<lb />
			Review of Working of the Existing System
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			25. Since the system existing prior to amendment will stand
			<lb />
			revived on the amendment being struck down and grievances
			<lb />
			have been expressed about its functioning, I am of the view
			<lb />
			that such grievances ought to be considered. It is made clear
			<lb />
			that grievances have not been expressed by the petitioners
			<lb />
			about the existence of the pre-existing system of appointment
			<lb />
			but about its functioning in practice. It has been argued that
			<lb />
			this Court can go into this aspect without re-visiting the earlier
			<lb />
			decisions of the larger Benches. I am of the view that such
			<lb />
			grievances ought to be gone into for which the matter needs
			<lb />
			to be listed for hearing.
			<lb />
			Conclusion
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			26. The impugned Amendment and the Act are struck down
			<lb />
			as unconstitutional. Pre-existing scheme of appointment of
			<lb />
			judges stands revived. The matter be listed for consideration
			<lb />
			of the surviving issue of grievances as to working of
			<lb />
			pre-existing system.

			<lb />
			The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the

			Amendment Act
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Statement of Objects and Reasons
			<lb />
			The Judges of the Supreme Court are appointed
			<lb />
			under clause (2) of article 124 and the Judges of
			<lb />
			the High Courts are appointed under clause (1) of
			<lb />
			article 217 of the Constitution, by the President.
			<lb />
			The Ad-hoc Judges and retired Judges for the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court are appointed under clause (1) of
			<lb />
			article 127 and article 128 of the Constitution
			<lb />
			respectively. The appointment of Additional Judges
			<lb />
			and Acting Judges for the High Court is made under
			<lb />
			article 224 and the appointment of retired Judges
			<lb />
			for sittings of the High Courts is made under article
			<lb />
			224A of the Constitution. The transfer of Judges
			<lb />
			from one High Court to another High Court is made
			<lb />
			by the President after consultation with the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice of India under clause (1) of article 222 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			2. The Supreme Court in the matter of Supreme
			<lb />
			Court Advocates-on-Record Association Vs. Union of
			<lb />
			India in the year 1993, and in its Advisory Opinion
			<lb />
			in the year 1998 in the Third Judges case, had
			<lb />
			interpreted clause (2) of article 124 and clause (1)
			<lb />
			of article 217 of the Constitution with respect to the
			<lb />
			meaning of &quot;consultation&quot; as &quot;concurrence&quot;.
			<lb />
			Consequently, a Memorandum of Procedure for
			<lb />
			appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court and
			<lb />
			High Courts was formulated, and is being followed
			<lb />
			for appointment.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			3. After review of the relevant constitutional
			<lb />
			provisions, the pronouncements of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court and consultations with eminent Jurists, it is
			<lb />
			felt that a broad based National Judicial
			<lb />
			Appointments Commission should be established
			<lb />
			for making recommendations for appointment of
			<lb />
			Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts. The
			<lb />
			said Commission would provide a meaningful role
			<lb />
			to the judiciary, the executive and eminent persons
			<lb />
