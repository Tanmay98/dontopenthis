			</p>
			<p>
				3.
				<lb />
				The Petitioner is a statutory body constituted by the
				<lb />
				Government of Maharashtra under the Maharashtra Slum Areas
				<lb />
				(Improvement, Clearance and Redevelopment) Act, 1971.
				<lb />
				The
				<lb />
				Respondent is a company incorporated under the provisions of the
				<lb />
				Companies Act, 1956 and for all purposes was represented, by its
				<lb />
				Chairman and Director Mr.Mukesh Mehta (for short &apos;Mr. Mehta&apos;)
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				4.
				<lb />
				The disputes between the parties concern an agreement
				<lb />
				between the parties entered in the year 2008 appointing the respondent as
				<lb />
				a Project Management Consultant (PMC), for a peculiar project
				<lb />
				concerning development of the &apos;Dharavi Slum Area&apos; in Mumbai, one of the
				<lb />
				biggest slums in Asia, at the relevant time covering an area of 151
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				4
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				hectares, about 46189 residents and approximately 12976 small and
				<lb />
				medium-sized business establishments. The details of this agreement are
				<lb />
				discussed in detail in the ensuing paragraphs.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				5.
				<lb />
				In or about 1988-89, the Government of Maharashtra, is
				<lb />
				stated to have introduced the concept of Cluster Type Re-development
				<lb />
				through people&apos;s participation. In or about 1996, the Government started
				<lb />
				undertaking various schemes in the slum areas in Mumbai, for which the
				<lb />
				Petitioner was designated as the Project Authority.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				6.
				<lb />
				In or about 2004, the Government of Maharashtra took a
				<lb />
				decision to replicate the concept of &apos;Sectoral Cluster Type Re-development
				<lb />
				in the &quot;Dharavi Area&apos;. Due to the complex nature of this re-development
				<lb />
				and the huge cost which would be incurred, it was decided to re-develop
				<lb />
				Dharavi through a process of &quot;Public Private Participation&quot; by dividing
				<lb />
				Dharavi into various sectors. For this purpose the zoning and sectors as
				<lb />
				proposed for the Dharavi Re-development plan, also came to be
				<lb />
				sanctioned by the Government of Maharashtra.
				<lb />
				It was decided that
				<lb />
				implementation of the Dharavi Re-development Project (for short &quot;DRP&quot;)
				<lb />
				would be undertaken as per the existing norms and regulations of the
				<lb />
				Cluster Rehabilitation Scheme. It was further decided that DRP would be
				<lb />
				implemented by inviting bids by a global tendering system.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				7.
				<lb />
				Mr.Mehta had offered his services to the Government of
				<lb />
				Maharashtra for preparing the DRP, which is not in dispute. In this regard
				<lb />
				the petitioner has stated that the Government of Maharashtra at the
				<lb />
				relevant time, without any formal bidding or open tender process, decided
				<lb />
				to take his services and to appoint Mr.Mukesh Mehta as an
				<lb />
				Advisor/Consultant for the DRP.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.
				<lb />
				On 4 February 2004 the Government through its Housing
				<lb />
				Department issued a Government Resolution (for short &quot;GR&quot;) stating its
				<lb />
				intention to undertake DRP at a total sanctioned cost of Rs.5600 crores
				<lb />
				and to appoint Mr.Mukesh Mehta as an Advisor/Consultant for DRP. This
				<lb />
				Government Resolution recorded that the fees and terms of reference
				<lb />
				payable to Mr.Mehta would be decided by a Committees of Secretaries
				<lb />
				(CoS) and all expenses in that regard, would be borne by the Petitioners.
				<lb />
				In pursuance of the said government resolution the petitioner started the
				<lb />
				work pertaining to the DRP with Mr.Mehta acting as an
				<lb />
				Advisor/Consultant.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.
				<lb />
				On 1 November 2008, the petitioner and the respondent
				<lb />
				entered into an agreement titled as &quot;Agreement for Project Management
				<lb />
				Consultant (PMC) Services&quot; (for short the &quot;PMC Agreement&quot;). Under the
				<lb />
				PMC Agreement, the respondent was to provide to the petitioner, its
				<lb />
				services which were listed in Appendix-A to the PMC agreement. The
				<lb />
				petitioner in turn was required to pay to the respondent the agreed fee
				<lb />
				restricted to 1% of Rs.5600 crores payable as per the Schedule of
				<lb />
				Payment (Appendix &quot;E&quot; to the PMC Agreement). Out of this 1% fee, 25%
				<lb />
				of the fee was payable to the respondent on completion of certain pre-
				<lb />
				tender activities as provided for in Appendix &quot;E&quot; to the PMC Agreement
				<lb />
				which was an amount of Rs.14 Crores. The balance 75% (Rs. 42 Crores)
				<lb />
				was payable for the post tender activities. All these payments were to be
				<lb />
				made by the petitioner to the respondent after retaining 5% of the
				<lb />
				amounts so payable as retention money towards satisfactory performance.
				<lb />
				The 5% retention amount was to be released to the respondent at the
				<lb />
				conclusion of the project that is partly upon obtaining the Completion
				<lb />
				Certificate and partly after three years from the date of Completion
				<lb />
				Certificate, as provided for in Clause 6.4 of the PMC Agreement. If the
				<lb />
				project was to progress and development activities to be undertaken in
				<lb />
				that event, the parties agreed that respondent would be paid 0.5% of the
				<lb />
				premium amount which would be received by the petitioner from the
				<lb />
				prospective developers on sale of the area. This was to be received by the
				<lb />
				respondent only after the petitioner had received the same. Hence, this
				<lb />
				part of the respondent&apos;s remuneration was linked to the financial success
				<lb />
				of the project. The respondent has described his involvement in the DRP
				<lb />
				to be &quot;his skin in the game&quot; .
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				10.
				<lb />
				The petitioner has sated that even prior to the execution of
				<lb />
				the PMC Agreement, the petitioner had paid the respondent a sum of
				<lb />
				Rs.7,22,29,600/-in respect of pre -tender activities. The petitioner had
				<lb />
				originally invited bids for the project through a &apos;Global Advertisement&apos;
				<lb />
				published in May 2007. About 101 potential bidders purchased the bid
				<lb />
				document, out of which only 26 submitted &quot;Expression of Interest&quot;, from
				<lb />
				which 19 bids were shortlisted to make a presentation. Only 14 bidders
				<lb />
				made their presentations. However, there were only 6 bidders left in the
				<lb />
				fray for DRP bidding for five Sectors of DRP. Eventually, the bidding
				<lb />
				process was cancelled on 16 th May 2011. The petitioner has stated that
				<lb />
				none of the claims which were made by the respondent in arbitral disputes
				<lb />
				pertained to the Global Advertisement of 2007. It is the petitioner&apos;s case
				<lb />
				that admittedly the project never reached the post tender stage and the
				<lb />
				respondent had not undertaken any post tender activities.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				11.
				<lb />
				In the above circumstances when everything was at a stand
				<lb />
				still the respondent being aggrieved, at such a stage of the DRP, on 26 th
				<lb />
				February 2010, invoked an arbitration interalia claiming idling charges.
				<lb />
				The disputes that had then arisen between the respondent and the
				<lb />
				petitioner were referred to an arbitration by a three member arbitral
				<lb />
				tribunal (for short &quot;First Arbitration&quot;). One of the grievances of the
				<lb />
				respondent in the First Arbitration was that the project, which was to be
				<lb />
				completed in 90 months (out of which 6 months had been allocated for
				<lb />
				pre -tender work) and as the project was still at a pre -tender stage for
				<lb />
				more than 6 years , the respondent had become entitled for idling/delay
				<lb />
				costs. In the said arbitration, the respondent raised number of claims,
				<lb />
				including a claim for idling charges in the sum of Rs.4,87,94,627/-( for
				<lb />
				idling/delay cost from 1 st April 2008 till 31 st May 2020) and for further
				<lb />
				sum of Rs.11,68,359/-(for idling/delay cost for the month of June 2020)
				<lb />
				and similarly, Rs.6,36,944/-for the period July 2020 till 1 st September
				<lb />
				2010.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				12.
				<lb />
				It so transpired that as the contract was unlikely to proceed
				<lb />
				and the project had remained at a standstill, during the pendency of the
				<lb />
				first Arbitration that is on 28 th November 2011 and 15 th June 2012
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				9
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				respectively, the petitioner submitted an alternative proposal to the
				<lb />
				Housing Department of the Government of Maharashtra for
				<lb />
				redevelopment of four out of five Sectors of Dharavi. This according to the
				<lb />
				petitioner was nothing to do with the PMC agreement entered with the
				<lb />
				respondent.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				13.
				<lb />
				The First Arbitration stood adjudicated by a majority award
				<lb />
				dated 21 st June 2012. In paragraph 5 of the said award, the Arbitral
				<lb />
				Tribunal observed that &apos;the Project is at stand still&apos;. The majority award
				<lb />
				directed the petitioner to pay to the respondent a sum of Rs.1,86,42,000/-
				<lb />
				with interest thereon as and by way of remuneration for the &quot;pre-tender
				<lb />
				activities&quot; as agreed between the parties under the PMC Agreement. The
				<lb />
				petitioner was also directed to pay entire amount retained by the
				<lb />
				petitioner under Clause 6 of the Agreement, which the petitioner was to
				<lb />
				retain as per the terms of Clause 6.4 (read with Serial No.5 of the &apos;Note&apos; to
				<lb />
				the Appendix &quot;E&quot;) of the PMC Agreement only to be paid, on the
				<lb />
				completion of the contract. All the other claims made by the respondent
				<lb />
				were rejected by the Arbitral Tribunal, including the respondent&apos;s claim in
				<lb />
				idling/delay costs. The respondent did not challenge this award.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				14.
				<lb />
				The respondent immediately after the Arbitral Tribunal
				<lb />
				delivered its award in the first arbitration, addressed a letter dated 25 th
				<lb />
				June 2012 to the petitioner, also forwarding on the same day an invoice,
				<lb />
				demanding payment of the retention amount as retained by the petitioner,
				<lb />
				in accordance with Clause 6.4 of PMC Agreement which was to be paid
				<lb />
				on completion of the contract.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				15.
				<lb />
				It is the petitioner&apos;s case that under Clause 6.4 of the PMC
				<lb />
				Agreement , it was clear that 50% of the retention amount was required to
				<lb />
				be released upon obtaining the Completion Certificate of the
				<lb />
				rehabilitation-component, renewal component, amenities, infrastructure
				<lb />
				etc., and the balance 50% of the retention amount was to be released after
				<lb />
				three years from the date of Completion Certificate, including that of
				<lb />
				infrastructure work. The petitioner asserted that demand of the retention
				<lb />
				amount by the respondent, which was payable only after completion of
				<lb />
				entire project, was ex facie contrary to the terms of PMC Agreement and
				<lb />
				in fact amounted to act of repudiation of the PMC Agreement by the
				<lb />
				respondent.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				16.
				<lb />
				Thereafter, the petitioner by its letter dated 4 th August 2012 is
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				11
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				stated to have accepted the respondent repudiation of the PMC Agreement
				<lb />
				and agreed to release to the respondent the amounts retained by the
				<lb />
				petitioner under Clause 6.4 of the PMC Agreement. By this letter, the
				<lb />
				petitioner also informed the respondent that the petitioner had taken a
				<lb />
				decision to cancel the bidding process and to allot the redevelopment of
				<lb />
				Sector 5 to the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority
				<lb />
				(for short MHADA) and that in the aforesaid circumstances, the DRP as
				<lb />
				originally envisaged which included global tendering as per the
				<lb />
				government resolution dated 4 th February 2004 had been presently
				<lb />
				stopped and was not being implemented in the original form. The
				<lb />
				petitioner accordingly, informed the respondent that without prejudice to
				<lb />
				its contention that the PMC Agreement stood repudiated and in the event
				<lb />
				the respondent was disputing its repudiation of the PMC Agreement the
				<lb />
				petitioner was terminating the PMC Agreement on account of occurrence
				<lb />
				of events which were specified in the termination clause namely Clause
				<lb />
				2.8.1 (G) of the PMC Agreement. This clause provided that the petitioner
				<lb />
				could terminate the PMC agreement NB: &quot;If the Dharavi Redevelopment
				<lb />
				Project for which the PMC is engaged is not implemented and /or stopped
				<lb />
				and abandoned by the State Government due to any change in law or
				<lb />
				litigation or for any reason whatsoever.&quot;

				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.
				<lb />
				It was the case of the Petitioner that the decision to
				<lb />
				terminate the PMC Agreement, was taken after considerable deliberation,
				<lb />
				which was undertaken for many months, at various levels of the
				<lb />
				Government and right up to the level of the Hon&apos;ble Chief Minister&apos;s
				<lb />
				Office, which was on account of the fact that the project had stopped and
				<lb />
				the respondent was demanding idling cost from the Petitioners, to which
				<lb />
				the respondent was not entitled.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				18.
				<lb />
				The petitioner&apos;s termination letter (dated 4 August 2012) was
				<lb />
				replied by the respondent by its letter dated 23 August 2012 inter alia
				<lb />
				contending that the termination of the PMC Agreement by the petitioner
				<lb />
				was malafide and based on extraneous reasons. According to the
				<lb />
				petitioner, the respondent also made several false and irresponsible
				<lb />
				allegations against various Officers of the Government of Maharashtra.
				<lb />
				The Petitioner has further stated that the respondent however did not
				<lb />
				withdraw its demand, for payment of the retention amount under clause
				<lb />
				6.4 of the PMC Agreement.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				19.
				<lb />
				On 17 September 2012 the Petitioners challenged the
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				13
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				Arbitral Award dated 21 June 2012 as passed by the arbitral tribunal in
				<lb />
				the first arbitration, by filing Arbitration Petition No. 1130 of 2012 before
				<lb />
				this Court. A learned Single Judge of this Court adjudicated the said
				<lb />
				Arbitration Petition. By an order dated 14 November 2012,the Arbitral
				<lb />
				Award dated 21 June 2012 in so far, as it pertained to the direction for
				<lb />
				payment of the retention amount referred to in clause 6.4 of the PMC
				<lb />
				Agreement, came to be set aside by the learned Single Judge. Thereafter,
				<lb />
				on 8 March 2013 the respondent again invoked arbitration to make a
				<lb />
				second reference to arbitration for adjudication of disputes interalia on a
				<lb />
				claim for damages under the PMC Agreement, being a reference leading to
				<lb />
				the impugned award. By an order dated 23 July 2013 passed in
				<lb />
				Arbitration Application No.139 of 2013 of this Court, a three-Member
				<lb />
				Arbitral Tribunal came to be constituted.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				20.
				<lb />
				On 28 November 2013 the respondent filed its statement of
				<lb />
				claim before the arbitral tribunal inter alia contending that the respondent
				<lb />
				had not repudiated the PMC Agreement and that the Petitioner had
				<lb />
				wrongly terminated the contract. The respondent accordingly, claimed
				<lb />
				damages in the sum of Rs.118.72 crores towards loss of profit due to
				<lb />
				wrongful termination of the PMC Agreement; Rs.60 crores towards loss of
				<lb />
				opportunity and good-will and Rs.25 crores compensation for stress and
				<lb />
				harassment to the claimant. The respondent made an alternative claim in
				<lb />
				the sum of Rs.30 crores towards the value of its plan, drawings, designs,
				<lb />
				concepts and other intellectual property. It was the respondent&apos;s
				<lb />
				contention that the termination was actuated by malafides as alleged
				<lb />
				against certain named Officers of the petitioners and other prominent
				<lb />
				individuals comprising the Committee of Experts appointed by the State
				<lb />
				Government. The allegations against these officers were reiterated in the
				<lb />
				affidavit of evidence of the respondent&apos;s first witness Mr.Mukesh Mehta.
				<lb />
				The petitioner has contended that all these Officers and other prominent
				<lb />
				individuals were not parties to the arbitral proceedings. In the statement
				<lb />
				of claim the respondent prayed for the following reliefs :
				<lb />
			</p>

				On behalf of the petitioner, a reply opposing the claims as

				made by the respondent, came to be filed on 24 March 2013 wherein the
				<lb />
				petitioner maintained that the respondent had repudiated the

				contract/PMC agreement, as also the termination of the PMC was legal

				and proper. It was contended that the respondent was thus not entitled for

				<lb />
				In the interim proceedings before the arbitral tribunal the
				<lb />
				petitioner had objected to the respondent making bald allegations against
				<lb />
				its officers and that too by their name when these officers were not even
				<lb />
				parties to the arbitration and as they could never be. In regard to these
				<lb />
				allegations as made against the Officers and other prominent persons, the
				<lb />
				Arbitral Tribunal upheld the petitioner&apos;s objections and directed the
				<lb />
				respondent to amend its statement of claim as well as Mr. Mehta&apos;s affidavit
				<lb />
				of evidence. Accordingly, the statement of claim came to be amended by
				<lb />
				inserting paragraph 99A. Also a fresh affidavit of evidence of Mr. Mehta
				<lb />
				dated 5 th February 2015 came to be filed. However, according to the
				<lb />
				petitioner, paragraph 99A was far from withdrawing the allegations and in
				<lb />
				fact it reiterated the allegations of mala fides against certain officers. This
				<lb />
				was again re-objected by the petitioner. According to the petitioner, it was
				<lb />
				wholly improper and unacceptable for the respondent to make such
				<lb />
				allegations as also the same could not be considered by the Arbitral
				<lb />
				Tribunal at any point of time.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				24.
				<lb />
				The respondent/claimant led evidence of three witnesses viz.,
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(i) Mr.Mukesh Mehta, Chairman of the respondent (ii) Mr. Girish Ranade
				<lb />
				of Ballal Engineering Pvt. Ltd. and (iii) Ms Gauri Shah of C.C. Chokshi &amp;
				<lb />
				Co.. These witnesses were cross-examined by the petitioner.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				25.
				<lb />
				The evidence of Mr. Girish Ranade of Ballal Engineering Pvt.
				<lb />
				Ltd. and Ms. Gauri Shah of Chokshi &amp; Co, was led to prove/support the
				<lb />
				respondent&apos;s claim for damages. According to the petitioner, Mr. Girish
				<lb />
				Ranade in fact admitted that the report made by him was incomplete
				<lb />
				inasmuch as several documents necessary to fully understand the report
				<lb />
				had not been produced being clear from his answer to question No.35 as
				<lb />
				posed to him in cross-examination. The petitioner has also stated that the
				<lb />
				report of M/s. C.C. Chokshi Advisors Pvt. Ltd. was partly based on Ballal
				<lb />
				Engineering&apos;s report, which was also incomplete inasmuch as the
				<lb />
				engagement letter was never produced. As also the first page of the report
				<lb />
				was deliberately suppressed at the relevant time and subsequently
				<lb />
				produced.
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				26.
				<lb />
				It so transpired that when the arbitral proceedings were at the
				<lb />
				fag end, on 30 th January 2016, the petitioner issued an advertisement
				<lb />
				inviting international bids for redevelopment of Sectors 1 to 4 of the
				<lb />
				Dharavi slum. This according to the petitioner was based on the
				<lb />
				fundamental change and modification of the DRP. The deadline as set out
				<lb />
				in the submission of bid was 7 th April 2016. It was the petitioner&apos;s case
				<lb />
				that this advertisement was an alternative approach of the petitioner,
				<lb />
				which was fundamentally different from the DRP in its original form as
				<lb />
				envisaged in the GR of 2004 and the PMC Agreement entered with the
				<lb />
				respondent.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				27.
				<lb />
				In the circumstances of this advertisement on DRP being
				<lb />
				issued on 30 th January 2016, the respondent on 2 nd February 2016,
				<lb />
				midway when it was closing the oral submissions, tendered in evidence
				<lb />
				the said newspaper advertisement issued/published by the petitioner in
				<lb />
				the Times of India dated 30 th January 2016 as also one of the bid
				<lb />
				document downloaded from the petitioner&apos;s website. The said
				<lb />
				advertisement and the documents in relation thereto were a matter of
				<lb />
				public record. The petitioner did not object these documents being
				<lb />
				produced by the respondent, which were accordingly taken on record and
				<lb />
				marked in evidence. Respondent&apos;s contention based on the advertisement
				<lb />
				dated 30 th January 2016 was that the DRP was alive and was being
				<lb />
				proceeded with, which proved that the case of the respondent that the
				<lb />
				petitioner has not stopped or abandoned the DRP and that such
				<lb />
				contention of the petitioner was false.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				28.
				<lb />
				Under the said advertisement, the last date for submission of
				<lb />
				the bid was 7 th April 2016. The petitioner has stated that in relation to the
				<lb />
				fresh advertisement between the period 30 th January 2016 to 30 th July
				<lb />
				2016, petitioner did not receive a single bid for even one of the four
				<lb />
				sectors, although the petitioner extended the deadline for submission of
				<lb />
				bids on five separate occasions, i.e., on 2 nd April 2016, 20 th April 2016, 6 th
				<lb />
				May 2016, 20 th May 2016 and finally on 21 st June 2016. The petitioner
				<lb />
				placed on record before the arbitral tribunal, these subsequent facts in
				<lb />
				regard to the outcome of the said tendering process. According to the
				<lb />
				petitioner, the respondent&apos;s theory that the project would be highly
				<lb />
				profitable and result in the petitioner earning premium running into
				<lb />
				thousand of crores even otherwise stood falsified. Accordingly, on 19 th
				<lb />
				August 2016, the petitioner made an application before the Arbitral
				<lb />
				Tribunal to file an additional reply to place on record the relevant
				<lb />
				additional facts which were in the public domain in regard to the outcome
				<lb />
				of the tendering process, which the respondent had sought to rely upon.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				29.
				<lb />
				On 24 th August 2016, the Arbitral Tribunal allowed the
				<lb />
				petitioner to file an additional reply to which the petitioner annexed
				<lb />
				documents to show that although the deadline for submission of bids were
				<lb />
				extended on five occasions, no bids at all were received from said project.
				<lb />
				The petitioner has contended that although the documents that were
				<lb />
				annexed to the reply inter-alia included public notices issued by the
				<lb />
				petitioner in various newspapers and which were issued pursuant to the
				<lb />
				notice inviting tenders dated 30 th January 2016 as placed on record by the
				<lb />
				respondent itself, surprisingly, the respondent refused to admit even the
				<lb />
				existence of these documents. The arbitral tribunal accordingly, required
				<lb />
				the petitioner to prove the same.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				30.
				<lb />
				The petitioner, therefore, led the evidence of three witnesses
				<lb />
				viz., Mr. Harish Varade, Mr. Mahesh Gadekar and Mr. Harshad Karade,
				<lb />
				who were examined for the limited purpose of proving three relevant
				<lb />
				facts. Firstly, that the deadline for submission of the bids were extended
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				22
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				from time to time and on five separate occasions; secondly, that the
				<lb />
				petitioner issued public notices in this regard in the newspapers and
				<lb />
				thirdly, that no bids were received for the said project even though the
				<lb />
				deadline for submission of bids were extended on five occasions.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				31.
				<lb />
				It is the petitioner&apos;s case that by virtue of evidence of these
				<lb />
				witnesses, it had clearly come on record that when the last tender was
				<lb />
				closed, there were no bids and hence there could be no question of grant
				<lb />
				of any damages based on theoretical and hypothetical probabilities and
				<lb />
				conjectures by way of expert reports as asserted by the respondent
				<lb />
				ignoring the reality, borne out by the facts that were known to all and to
				<lb />
				the world at large, that the DRP was a commercial failure and that no
				<lb />
				bidders were willing to participate in the project and pay premium that
				<lb />
				the respondent had imagined would be received by the petitioner. The
				<lb />
				petitioner&apos;s contention being that there cannot be a claim for damages on
				<lb />
				hypothesis and overlooking the reality in regard to the project on record.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				32.
				<lb />
				The Arbitral Tribunal concluded the submissions of the parties
				<lb />
				on 3 rd April 2017 as also written submissions were filed by the respondent
				<lb />
				and the petitioner on 3 rd May 2017 and 8 th May 2017 respectively.

				<lb />
				The Arbitral Tribunal published the impugned award on 15 th
				<lb />
				February 2018, whereby the Arbitral Tribunal, inter alia, rejected the
				<lb />
				petitioner&apos;s contention that the respondent had repudiated the PMC
				<lb />
				Agreement by interalia seeking payment of retention money and held that
				<lb />
				the petitioner&apos;s termination of the PMC Agreement was wrongful and not
				<lb />
				valid in law. The Arbitral Tribunal, accordingly, awarded to the respondent
				<lb />
				a sum of Rs. 86.72 crores as damages for loss of profit. The Arbitral
				<lb />
				Tribunal rejected the respondent&apos;s claims for loss of goodwill and
				<lb />
				reputation, mental harassment and anguish and its alternative claim for
				<lb />
				damages for its drawings.
				<lb />
				The Arbitral Tribunal while awarding the
				<lb />
				respondent a sum of Rs.86.72 crores as damages for loss of profit,
				<lb />
				accepted the estimate set out in the report of C.C. Chokshi Advisors Pvt.
				<lb />
				Ltd. (for short Chokshi report), that is an expected receipt of the premium
				<lb />
				of Rs. 23,271 crores which could be potentially offered by developers to
				<lb />
				the petitioner. The Arbitral Tribunal, according to the petitioner, calculated
				<lb />
				the respondent&apos;s share of this estimated premium at 0.5% of Rs.23,271
				<lb />
				crores, i.e., Rs.116 crores and added to this amount sum of Rs.42 crores as
				<lb />
				fees for post -tender work i.e., (Rs.116 crores + Rs.42 crores = Rs.158
				<lb />
				crores). The petitioner has contended that although the petitioner had
				<lb />
				disputed the respondent&apos;s entitlement to the post tender fees, the Arbitral
				<lb />
				Tribunal did not deal with this contention, but instead simply included this
				<lb />
				amount in its calculation of damages for loss of profit. The Arbitral
				<lb />
				Tribunal also deducted the respondent&apos;s potential expenses as estimated
				<lb />
				by Mr. Mehta to be Rs.71.28 crores, i.e., (Rs.158 crores -Rs.71.28 crores
				<lb />
				= Rs.86.72 crores). The relevant paragraphs of the impugned arbitral
				<lb />
				award inter alia rejecting certain claims as noted above, and granting
				<lb />
				claim of Rs.86.72 crores as damages for wrongful termination of the
				<lb />
				contract as follows:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;74. The Claimant has claimed a further sum of Rs.25 crores for
				<lb />
				harassment and mental anguish. The Claimant has relied upon
				<lb />
				correspondence and notings exchanged between different
				<lb />
				concerned Departments of the State of Maharashtra including the
				<lb />
				Respondent in this connection. He has again and again referred to
				<lb />
				the alleged malice that some Officers of the State of Maharashtra
				<lb />
				bore against him although he had been told by the Tribunal right
				<lb />
				at the beginning that any claim for personal malice will not be
				<lb />
				gone into by the Tribunal in the absence of the persons against
				<lb />
				whom such an allegation is made. We cannot go into the
				<lb />
				allegations of harassment by certain Officers of the State of
				<lb />
				Maharashtra as herein before stated. We therefore reject the claim
				<lb />
				of the Claimant for Rs.25 crores under this subhead.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				75.
				<lb />
				As we have awarded to the Claimant Rs.86.72 crores as
				<lb />
				damages for wrongful termination of the contract, we reject/ do
				<lb />
				not consider the alternative claim for damages of Rs.30 crores for
				<lb />
				drawings etc.

				<lb />
				In the premises, the Claimant is entitled to receive from the
				<lb />
				Respondent a sum or Rs.86.72 crores as damages for wrongful
				<lb />
				termination of the said contract. The Respondent shall pay interest
				<lb />
				at the rate of 9% per annum on the said amount from the date of
				<lb />
				the claim made in these proceedings till payment or realisation.
				<lb />
				Looking to the facts and circumstances of the present case, interest

				<lb />
				Mr.Khambata, learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioner in
				<lb />
				assailing the impugned award has made the following submissions:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(i)
				<lb />
				The Arbitral Tribunal&apos;s finding on the non-repudiation of the
				<lb />
				PMC Agreement by the respondent is perverse and contrary to the facts
				<lb />
				and record. In this context, it is submitted that all the circumstances and
				<lb />
				conduct of the respondent resulting into calling upon the petitioner to
				<lb />
				return the retention money forthwith which was well before obtaining
				<lb />
				completion certificate as mandated by PMC Agreement, respondent
				<lb />
				unequivocally expressed its intention to terminate the contract and did in
				<lb />
				fact do so. Respondent&apos;s demand for payment of retention amount was
				<lb />
				ex-facie contrary to the terms of PMC Agreement and constituted an act of
				<lb />
				repudiation of Contract. It is submitted that the respondent was in fact put
				<lb />
				to notice that the petitioner was treating the respondent&apos;s demand for
				<lb />
				return of retention money as repudiation of PMC Agreement.
				<lb />
				Nevertheless the respondent persisted in its demand. Respondent
				<lb />
				conscious of the fact that payment of retention amount was awarded
				<lb />
				without any such claim being made, ought to have withdrawn its demand
				<lb />
				for payment of this retention amount, as opposed to adamantly pursuing
				<lb />
				the same. It is submitted that in fact the respondent even defended its
				<lb />
				demand for retention amount even at the time of hearing of the
				<lb />
				petitioner&apos;s challenge to the award rendered in the first arbitration.
				<lb />
				Further notwithstanding the order passed by this court dated 14.11.2014
				<lb />
				by which the majority award in so far as to pay retention amount to the
				<lb />
				respondent was set aside, this amount has been paid to the respondent
				<lb />
				who has willingly accepted the same. It is thus, submitted that the
				<lb />
				respondent has thereby demonstrated clear, consistent and unequivocally
				<lb />
				expressed intention to repudiate the express terms of the PMC
				<lb />
				Agreement. It is thus, contended that the impugned award be quashed
				<lb />
				and set aside.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(ii)
				<lb />
				The Arbitral Tribunal&apos;s finding that the termination of the
				<lb />
				P.M.C. Agreement was wrongful and invalid suffers from complete non-
				<lb />
				application of mind and ignores the contractual clauses and vital evidence.
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the Petitioner terminated the P.M.C. Agreement under
				<lb />
				Clause 2.8.1(g) by its notice dated 4 August .2012 which clearly recorded
				<lb />
				in paragraph 5 that the D.R.P. as originally envisaged in the P.M.C.
				<lb />
				Agreement, through global tendering, as per G.R. dated 4 February 2004,
				<lb />
				for which the Respondent services were engaged for pre-tender and post-
				<lb />
				tender activities had stopped and were not being implemented. It is
				<lb />
				submitted that even before the Arbitral Tribunal, it was a categorical case
				<lb />
				of the petitioner and an accepted position that the D.R.P. for which the
				<lb />
				Respondent was engaged was not being implemented and/or was stopped
				<lb />
				and abandoned.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(iii)
				<lb />
				Moreover the Respondent&apos;s claim for idling charges as made
				<lb />
				in first arbitration was also premised on the Respondent&apos;s contention that
				<lb />
				the Respondent &quot;was required to keep idle his staff engaged for the
				<lb />
				project as post-tender activities were not carried out even though the
				<lb />
				period of 2 years and more had lapsed.&quot; It is submitted that in the
				<lb />
				proceedings of the present arbitration the Petitioner had categorically
				<lb />
				relied upon the observations as contained in the Majority Award dated
				<lb />
				21 st June 2012 as made in the first Arbitration, to the effect that the
				<lb />
				project was at a &apos;stand still&apos; since July 2009. The Majority Award also
				<lb />
				observed that the Respondent was carrying out pre-tender works for
				<lb />
				almost 4 ½ years from the date the PMC agreement was entered between
				<lb />
				the parties. The said Award had also recorded that the project was at
				<lb />
				&apos;stand still&apos; &quot;.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				pvr
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(iv)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the Petitioner also relied upon the
				<lb />
				submissions as made by the learned Counsel on behalf of the Respondent
				<lb />
				in the proceedings of Arbitration Petition No.1130 of 2014 filed by the
				<lb />
				Petitioner challenging Arbitral Award as made in the first Arbitration.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				v)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal in passing the
				<lb />
				impugned Award has completely ignored the contentions of the
				<lb />
				respondent raised before this Court in the challenge to the first
				<lb />
				arbitral award when the arbitral tribunal in the impugned award
				<lb />
				holds &apos;that there was no material that has been put before the
				<lb />
				Arbitral Tribunal by the Petitioner to show that the project has been
				<lb />
				abandoned or is permanently stopped.&apos; It is thus submitted that the
				<lb />
				impugned Award ignores vital evidence and suffers from non
				<lb />
				application of mind.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				vi)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the Respondent was not correct in
				<lb />
				contending that as in Arbitration Petition No.1130 of 2014 this Court had
				<lb />
				set aside the Award for grant of retention money payable to the
				<lb />
				Respondent on the basis that the project was still subsisting. Referring to
				<lb />
				paragraph 9 of this Order dated 14 th November 2014 passed by this Court
				<lb />
				it is submitted that the Award of retention money in favour of the
				<lb />
				Respondent in the first Arbitration was set aside by this Court by making
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				the following observations &quot;-------In the light of specific clause of the
				<lb />
				Contract and that there was not even a claim for refund of retention
				<lb />
				money the Arbitrators could not have awarded the payment of the
				<lb />
				retention money to the Respondent.&quot;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				vii)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal in recording findings
				<lb />
				in paragraph 28 to 30 of the impugned Award that the Petitioner&apos;s
				<lb />
				termination of P.M.C. Agreement is invalid has relied upon the Notice
				<lb />
				dated 30 th January 2016 issued by the Petitioner inviting tenders for re-
				<lb />
				development of Dharavi. The Arbitral Tribunal having held NB: &quot;In fact
				<lb />
				Notice inviting tenders goes to show that the project is alive and the State
				<lb />
				Government proposes to go ahead with the project. Clause 2.8.1 (g) is,
				<lb />
				therefore, not attracted. Termination of Contract is not valid in law.&quot;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				viii)
				<lb />
				In regard to the above findings of the Arbitral Tribunal, it is
				<lb />
				submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal has ignored a series of documents
				<lb />
				including internal notings which would demonstrate that the decision to
				<lb />
				terminate P.M.C. Agreement by the Petitioner was a result of detailed
				<lb />
				deliberation and consideration by various Government Officers right upto
				<lb />
				the level of the Principal Secretary-Housing and the final decision in that
				<lb />
				regard was taken by the Hon&apos;ble Chief Minister. It is submitted that these
				<lb />
				documents and notings bare out that the decision to terminate P.M.C.
				<lb />
				Agreement was taken, in view of the fact that the project has come to a
				<lb />
				&apos;stand still&apos; and that the Respondent had continued to make demands
				<lb />
				upon the Petitioner to pay delay/idling costs. It is submitted that the
				<lb />
				Petitioner in fact submitted chronological summary of these documents
				<lb />
				and notings at paragraph 82 to 84 of its written submissions filed before
				<lb />
				Arbitral Tribunal.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				ix)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the Petitioner&apos;s objection in regard to the
				<lb />
				impropriety and inadmissibility of the allegations made by the Respondent
				<lb />
				against various named Officers of the Petitioner was also upheld by the
				<lb />
				Arbitral Tribunal in the impugned Award. Submission of the petitioner is
				<lb />
				at that once this case of the Petitioner was accepted and these allegations
				<lb />
				of the Respondent were found to be false, the Arbitral Tribunal could not
				<lb />
				held the termination to be invalid. It is submitted that the Arbitral
				<lb />
				Tribunal has also recorded a finding that there was no material to show
				<lb />
				that termination was for ulterior motive or done with oblique or indirect
				<lb />
				object. However, having held so the Arbitral Tribunal in later part of the
				<lb />
				impugned Award while dealing with the Respondent&apos;s claim for damages
				<lb />
				contradicted itself by holding that the Petitioner created some evidence
				<lb />
				during the course of hearing by way of after though to dis-lodge the claim
				<lb />
				of the Respondent namely the Petitioner issuing an advertisement dated
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				31
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				30.01.2016 inviting global bids for D.R.P. It is, thus, submitted that the
				<lb />
				impugned Award is vitiated by internal contradictions.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				x)
				<lb />
				It is next submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal&apos;s failure to
				<lb />
				consider and take into account express terms of the Contract is contrary to
				<lb />
				the fundamental policy of Indian Law and public policy. This is being
				<lb />
				elaborated by the following submissions:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xi)
				<lb />
				By ignoring express terms of the Contract, the Arbitral
				<lb />
				Tribunal has unjustly enriched the Respondent at the cost of the Petitioner
				<lb />
				which is a Government body/State in relation to the respondent&apos;s claim as
				<lb />
				made in the context of Clause 6.1(B) of the P.M.C. Agreement, providing
				<lb />
				that &quot;P.M.C. shall additionally receive 0.5% of the total premium received
				<lb />
				by S.R.A.&quot;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xii)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that when the said Clause specifically used the
				<lb />
				words &quot;received by S.R.A&quot;. it is premised on the fact that the Respondent
				<lb />
				would be entitled to percentage of premium if and only if the Petitioner
				<lb />
				receives such premium. That by virtue of the said Clause Respondent had
				<lb />
				agreed to take part of the consideration, as percentage of total premium
				<lb />
				received conscious of a possibility that if the project was not being
				<lb />
				implemented and/or stopped or abandoned for any reason whatsoever,
				<lb />
				(Clause 2.8.1(g)). In any case if the Petitioner was not to receive any
				<lb />
				premium consequently also the Respondent would not be entitled to any
				<lb />
				premium, due to such non receipt of premium by the Petitioner. It is
				<lb />
				submitted that the Respondent in fact in the course of Arbitral proceedings
				<lb />
				repeatedly referred to this risk on its part as having &quot;skin in the game&quot;.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xiii)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal failed to consider
				<lb />
				that as per the terms of the Contract, it was sufficient for the Petitioner to
				<lb />
				demonstrate that the project was not being implemented and which was
				<lb />
				as agreed by parties in Clause 2.8.1(g). It is submitted that the
				<lb />
				Respondent was not correct in contending that on reading of Clause
				<lb />
				2.8.1(g) of the P.M.C. Agreement it was incumbent on the Petitioner to
				<lb />
				demonstrate not just that the project has been stopped &quot;but it has also
				<lb />
				been abandoned.&quot; Such contention was complete misreading of Clause
				<lb />
				2.8.1(g) which clearly afforded to the Petitioner a right of termination if
				<lb />
				the project &quot;is not implemented&quot; which was distinct from a situation of it
				<lb />
				being &quot;stopped and abandoned&quot;. The Arbitral Tribunal has clearly failed
				<lb />
				to consider admitted fact that the project was not being implemented. It is
				<lb />
				thus, submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal grossly failed to take into
				<lb />
				account express terms of the Contract in granting Respondent&apos;s claim for
				<lb />
				0.5% of the premium when the Petitioner itself had not received any
				<lb />
				premium, in a manner that no fair minded or reasonable body of persons
				<lb />
				would do. The impugned Award is, therefore, in contravention of
				<lb />
				fundamental policy of the Indian Law.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xiv)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the impugned Award is vitiated by
				<lb />
				fundamental internal contradictions. Hence, it is patently illegal and
				<lb />
				contrary to the public policy of India on the following contentions. The
				<lb />
				Arbitral Tribunal in recording a finding that the PMC agreement was not
				<lb />
				stopped and/or abandoned has referred to the advertisement published by
				<lb />
				the petitioner on 30 January 2016 inviting bids for the DRP. In this
				<lb />
				context, attention is drawn to para 30 of the arbitral award wherein the
				<lb />
				arbitral tribunal observes that &quot;…In fact, the notice inviting tenders
				<lb />
				during the pendency of these proceedings goes to show that the project is
				<lb />
				alive and the State Government proposes to go ahead with the project..&quot;.
				<lb />
				This when the Arbitral Tribunal has itself noted that it was the respondent
				<lb />
				who brought the advertisement/public notice dated 30 January 2016 on
				<lb />
				record of the Arbitral proceedings (paragraph 64 of the impugned Award)
				<lb />
				whereas the Arbitral Tribunal has shunned the very same evidence,as
				<lb />
				fabricated in context of the petitioner&apos;s defence to the respondent&apos;s claim
				<lb />
				for damages on account of its 0.5 % profit in the premium received by the
				<lb />
				Petitioner. It is submitted that also the very same evidence has been
				<lb />
				commented as a last minute attempt by the Petitioner to create some
				<lb />
				evidence during the course of hearing, by way of an after-thought to
				<lb />
				dislodge the claim of the respondents. It is thus, submitted that this
				<lb />
				evidence could not have been rejected when considering the case of the
				<lb />
				Petitioner on termination,to hold that the Petitioner&apos;s termination was
				<lb />
				wrongful. It is submitted that on such findings, the Arbitral Tribunal could
				<lb />
				not have proceeded to estimate &apos;loss of profit&apos; caused to the respondents
				<lb />
				on account of its share of the potential premium that the Petitioner could
				<lb />
				have possibly earned and on the basis of speculations and conjectures. It is
				<lb />
				submitted that in doing so, the Arbitral Tribunal has rendered the
				<lb />
				impugned award perverse and irrational, vitiated by its own
				<lb />
				contradictions, patently illegal and contrary to the Public Policy of India.
				<lb />
				To support this submission, reliance is placed on the decision of the
				<lb />
				Supreme Court in McDermott International INC vs.Burn Standard Co
				<lb />
				Ltd. 1
				<lb />
				xv)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that in any event the Arbitral Tribunal could
				<lb />
				not have ignored the fact that no bids were received by the Petitioner
				<lb />
				(despite five extensions) in determining the quantum of damages to be
				<lb />
				awarded to the respondents which was something which went to the root
				<lb />
				of the matter. For this reason, the impugned Award is rendered patently
				<lb />
				illegal and deserves to be set aside on this ground alone.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xvi)
				<lb />
				The Arbitral Tribunal has also not dealt with the five decisions
				<lb />
				cited on behalf of the Petitioner in support of the proposition that
				<lb />
				damages cannot be granted on a notional and speculative basis when
				<lb />
				actual facts are known to the Tribunal.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xvii)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the respondent has failed to provide any
				<lb />
				cogent answer to this fundamental and inherent flaw in the impugned
				<lb />
				Award. The respondent&apos;s explanation as contained in its three submissions
				<lb />
				purportedly attempting to explain these inherent contradictions is falsified
				<lb />
				by the record, namely the first contention of the respondent that there was
				<lb />
				no evidence that no bids have been received in response to the global
				<lb />
				advertisement issued in 2016. According to the Petitioner, this was plainly
				<lb />
				false as there were numerous documents on record and available in public
				<lb />
				domain, as also evidence as led on behalf of the petitioner of Mr.Harshad
				<lb />
				Karade by virtue of which, it was clearly established that no bids were
				<lb />
				received. Even in his cross-examination, Mr.Harshad Karde had stated that
				<lb />
				when last tender was closed, there were no bids received. Secondly, the
				<lb />
				respondent submitting before this Court, for the first time that the
				<lb />
				subsequent events of 2016 would have no bearing on the respondent&apos;s
				<lb />
				claim for damage on account of the fact that termination of the PMC
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				36
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				agreement took place in the year 2012. It is submitted that no such
				<lb />
				argument was canvassed by the respondents, before the arbitral Tribunal
				<lb />
				and therefore, it cannot be countenanced before this Court at this belated
				<lb />
				stage. The impugned Award also does not proceed, on this premise at all,
				<lb />
				and it is submitted and the respondents, cannot at this stage supplant the
				<lb />
				reasonings of the Arbitral Tribunal with its own. It is thus submitted that
				<lb />
				there is no basis whatsoever, for the findings as recorded, by the Arbitral
				<lb />
				Tribunal that the global advertisement and tender dated 30 January 2016
				<lb />
				was issued/created as an after-thought to dislodge the claim of the
				<lb />
				respondents in the arbitral proceedings.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(xviii)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the direct evidence on the viability of the
				<lb />
				project was that no bids were received despite five extensions. According
				<lb />
				to the petitioner, the respondent&apos;s submission ignores the vital fact that
				<lb />
				the respondent was entitled to be paid 0.5 % of the premium &apos;as received
				<lb />
				by the SRA&quot; under clause 6.1 (B)&quot; and in fact none was either received or
				<lb />
				forthcoming. Hence there could not have been any claim for damages.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xix)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the respondent&apos;s contention that there was
				<lb />
				no evidence before the Arbitral Tribunal of the bidding criteria and terms
				<lb />
				of the project advertised in 2016 and therefore, its viability could not have
				<lb />
				fairly ascertained, also was totally untenable. It is submitted, that it was
				<lb />
				an admitted position that the terms of the bids documents and the bidding
				<lb />
				criteria was to be set-up and decided by the Petitioner itself.
				<lb />
				The
				<lb />
				respondents even if it remained in the contract would not have any say in
				<lb />
				the bidding criteria. The respondent&apos;s had repeatedly stated that it had
				<lb />
				&quot;skin in the game&quot; and hence, the respondent was not entitled to associate
				<lb />
				itself and its ability to earn profit with some aspect of the project and dis-
				<lb />
				associate itself with others. It is thus, submitted that the allegation of the
				<lb />
				respondent that the petitioner lay an onerous criteria with intent to
				<lb />
				dissuade the bidders from coming forward, defied logic and common
				<lb />
				sense.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xx)
				<lb />
				The Arbitral Tribunal has passed the impugned Award
				<lb />
				contrary to the settled-law that, when direct evidence was available as to
				<lb />
				ascertain the actual damages, it was forbidden to assert damages based
				<lb />
				on hypothesis or expert estimates. In this context, it is submitted that the
				<lb />
				respondents had made a claim for damages, on the basis of hypothetical
				<lb />
				premium that might have been received from the respondents from
				<lb />
				potential developers for DRP and more particularly considering clause 6.1
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(B) of the PMC Agreement which provided that the respondents will be
				<lb />
				entitled to a part of the premium received from SRA. Thus, the
				<lb />
				respondent&apos;s remuneration was uncertain and dependent on the financial
				<lb />
				success of the project and on the basis, the Petitioner receiving premium
				<lb />
				referred by the respondents as &quot;skin in the game&quot;. It is submitted that the
				<lb />
				respondents led evidence purportedly of experts to project the likely
				<lb />
				premium that may be received by the petitioner for DRP which was totally
				<lb />
				imaginary.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxi)
				<lb />
				The Respondents during the course of the arbitral
				<lb />
				proceedings, produced public advertisement dated 30 January 2016
				<lb />
				issued by the petitioner inviting bids in respect of the DRP to contend that
				<lb />
				the project was an on-going project. The petitioner&apos;s submission is that
				<lb />
				this was responded on behalf of the petitioner without prejudice to their
				<lb />
				contention that the termination of the PMC agreement was valid firstly by
				<lb />
				producing evidence to show firstly that the dead-line for submission of the
				<lb />
				bids was extended on five separate occasions; secondly that the petitioner
				<lb />
				had issued notices in this regard and thirdly, no bids were received for the
				<lb />
				project despite five extensions which were facts in the public domain. The
				<lb />
				petitioner submits that based on these facts, the petitioner canvassed
				<lb />
				according to it, a well-settled position in law that the Arbitral Tribunal
				<lb />
				ought not to have ignored and shut its eyes to the &quot;basic realities&quot; of the
				<lb />
				case and ignored matters on record in considering award of damages on
				<lb />
				speculation, conjectures and hypothetical basis as asserted by the
				<lb />
				respondents. The principle that damages are intended to a place a
				<lb />
				contractual party as far as in the same position he would have been had
				<lb />
				the contract was to operate, no better and no worse , if he had not
				<lb />
				suffered wrong complained of and the party, cannot be a wind-fall gain
				<lb />
				and/or an unjust enrichment. It is the petitioner&apos;s submission that this
				<lb />
				well-settled position has been completely ignored by the Arbitral tribunal
				<lb />
				in award of damages. In supporting this submission, the petitioner rely on
				<lb />
				the decision of The Bwllfa and Merphyr Dare Steam Collierres (1891 LTD
				<lb />
				vs The Pontyupvidd Water Works Co-2 and in Williamson vs John I
				<lb />
				Thornycoft &amp; Co Ltd. 3 and in Golden Strait Corporation vs Nippon Yusen
				<lb />
				Knbishika Kaisha 4 .
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxii)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the respondent&apos;s response to the above
				<lb />
				arguments of the petitioner before the Arbitral tribunal was that the
				<lb />
				petitioner had led evidence of witnesses, who had no personal knowledge
				<lb />
				in the subsequent events that had transpired. Also that the judgments
				<lb />
				cited by the petitioner, were not applicable as the petitioner has not been
				<lb />
				able to prove any subsequent events. This submission of the respondent,
				<lb />
				according to the petitioner was completely contrary to the record as there
				<lb />
				was sufficient evidence on record that no bids were received in pursuance
				<lb />
				of the advertisement dated 30 January 2016. The tribunal not only dis-
				<lb />
				regarded the evidence but has committed patently illegality in recording a
				<lb />
				finding and it was last minute attempt on the part of the petitioner to
				<lb />
				issue the advertisement which was by way of an after-thought to dislodge
				<lb />
				the claim of the respondents. It is submitted that the findings of the
				<lb />
				Arbitral Tribunal in this regard, are also based on no evidence and are ex-
				<lb />
				facie perverse, to the extent that no reasonable body of persons can arrive
				<lb />
				at such findings. It is submitted that it was absurd to suggest that the
				<lb />
				petitioner which is an instrumentality of the State, would float a global
				<lb />
				advertisement inviting bids in order to create evidence to defeat the
				<lb />
				respondent&apos;s claim for damages and that too, without having an idea with
				<lb />
				respect to the outcome of such bids.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxiii)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that, in fact there would not have been a better
				<lb />
				evidence of the fact that the project was completely unviable had the PMC
				<lb />
				Agreement not being terminated, and secondly, the respondents would not
				<lb />
				have earned any premium. However, despite this, the Tribunal had held
				<lb />
				that there is no evidence oral or documentary to establish that the project
				<lb />
				was not viable or it was not abandoned for all times or no premium would
				<lb />
				have been received by the respondents in connection with the project.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxiv)
				<lb />
				It is next submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal has inexplicably
				<lb />
				rejected vital evidence available in public domain which best
				<lb />
				demonstrated the reality of the situation viz. that in fact no bids were
				<lb />
				received and the project was unviable. Instead, the Arbitral Tribunal has
				<lb />
				relied upon irrelevant and incomplete evidence.
				<lb />
				This evidence being
				<lb />
				letter dated 9 th March 2011 from OSD-DRP to the Secretary Housing
				<lb />
				department. This letter according to the petitioner in no manner
				<lb />
				amounted to an admission by the petitioner of huge premium that was
				<lb />
				expected to receive as ascertained by the respondent. It is submitted that
				<lb />
				in making such submissions, the Respondent overlooked that this letter
				<lb />
				only refers to a presentation made by third party consultation Darshaw &amp;
				<lb />
				Company Private Limited and was not petitioner&apos;s own estimation. It,
				<lb />
				therefore, could not have been treated to be admission of the petitioner.
				<lb />
				The award hence, makes a fundamental error of treating the statements in
				<lb />
				this letter as admissions by the Petitioner.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxv)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that in any event the said letter set out only
				<lb />
				estimate of gross profit which the Respondent was expected to earn.
				<lb />
				However, subsequent course of events had demonstrated that in fact DRP
				<lb />
				was unviable. No bids were received and the Petitioner received no
				<lb />
				premium whatsoever. Despite this, the Arbitral Tribunal contrary to well
				<lb />
				settled principles of law has brushed aside the stark reality as to the
				<lb />
				profitability of DRP and instead proceeded to award damages based only
				<lb />
				on estimates and conjectures.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxvi)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that in any event this letter dated 9 th March
				<lb />
				2011 only referred to estimate of gross profit (not the premium) that may
				<lb />
				be earned. It is submitted that gross profit amount by its very definition
				<lb />
				and as expressly set out in 9 th March 2011 letter itself, need not provide
				<lb />
				for either interest or tax that would be payable by the Developer and
				<lb />
				would necessarily reduce any premium that the Developer may offer.
				<lb />
				The gross profit was, therefore, no indication of the amount that any
				<lb />
				developer would have bid and premium that S.R.A. would have received.
				<lb />
				The Arbitral Tribunal, however, erroneously treated the gross profit and
				<lb />
				the premium as synonymous.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxvii)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that during the course of their argument before
				<lb />
				the arbitral tribunal , the Petitioner tendered a &apos;Note&apos; titled &quot;Brief Note on
				<lb />
				Dharavi Re-development Project&quot; clarifying that only six bids were
				<lb />
				received in 2007-2008 bid process and given that one bidder could only
				<lb />
				get one of the 5 sectors, there would be no competition in the global
				<lb />
				bidding process. This Note was totally ignored by the Arbitral Tribunal.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxviii)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the evidence on the cost estimate
				<lb />
				prepared by Ballal Engineering Private Limited (the Ballal Report) also
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				could not have been accepted by the arbitral tribunal. It is submitted that
				<lb />
				the report was based on the drawings, specifications, information and
				<lb />
				documents provided by the Respondent itself as also the supporting
				<lb />
				documentation did not form part of the arbitral record. It is thus,
				<lb />
				submitted that this Report was nothing more than summary of the
				<lb />
				detailed estimate and measurement sheet prepared, which the respondent
				<lb />
				chose not to place on record. It is submitted that the author of Ballal
				<lb />
				Report Mr.Girish Ranade (CW-2) confirmed that, &quot;there is a detailed
				<lb />
				estimate and measurement sheet prepared section-wise and that these
				<lb />
				were only summaries which were attached there&quot;. He also admitted that
				<lb />
				without the supporting documents the Ballal Report was incomplete. It is
				<lb />
				submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal has also noted in the impugned award
				<lb />
				that the Ballal Report was, &quot;merely tabulated summary of the conclusions
				<lb />
				arrived at and that consequently the petitioner could not cross examine
				<lb />
				the witness on these measurements and estimates&quot;. The Petitioner
				<lb />
				submits that however, instead of rejecting Ballal Report as incomplete, the
				<lb />
				Arbitral Tribunal had concluded that it was incumbent upon the Petitioner
				<lb />
				to call upon the Respondent to produce complete documentation in this
				<lb />
				regard, and has proceeded to award damages on the basis of such
				<lb />
				incomplete report.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxix)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that it can never be conceived that it was
				<lb />
				neither the duty or obligation of the Petitioner to ensure completeness of
				<lb />
				respondent&apos;s evidence. Such a principle would result in absurdity. Hence,
				<lb />
				reasoning of the Arbitral Tribunal in this regard, is patently illegal and
				<lb />
				perverse, so as to shock the conscience of the Court.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxx)
				<lb />
				In regard to the Chokshi report, estimating the expected
				<lb />
				premium that the petitioner might receive, it is submitted that, even this
				<lb />
				Report was based on assumptions and estimates provided by Mr.Mukesh
				<lb />
				Mehta (CW-1) including but not limited to the Ballal Report. The Chokshi
				<lb />
				Report had also clearly recorded that it was based on the information
				<lb />
				relating to the Company, furnished by the Management and information
				<lb />
				available in public domain regarding other players in the Industry. It is
				<lb />
				further submitted that the estimate provided in the Chokshi Report were
				<lb />
				based on the &apos;Working Papers&apos; and &apos;Excel Workings&apos; which formed part of
				<lb />
				the Report and yet were not placed on record by the Respondent.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxxi)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the veracity and independence of Chokshi
				<lb />
				Report was also vitiated by the evidence of Mr.Mukesh Mehta-CW 1 who
				<lb />
				in his affidavit of evidence stated he requested the said advisor to estimate
				<lb />
				reasonable premium that could have been offered by the developers to the
				<lb />
				Government of Maharashtra ranging from Rs.23,270/-Crores to
				<lb />
				Rs.29,600/-Crores. The Chokshi Report also estimated expected premium
				<lb />
				to be in the range i.e. 23,271/-to 29679 Crores. It is thus, submitted that
				<lb />
				the Arbitral Tribunal has shut its eyes to the facts and events in awarding
				<lb />
				damages to the Respondent on the basis of assumptions and conjectures,
				<lb />
				by ignoring vital evidence and taking into account irrelevant evidence.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxxii)
				<lb />
				It is next submitted that, before the Arbitral Tribunal the
				<lb />
				petitioner had categorically urged that the Respondent was not entitled to
				<lb />
				even a penny of post tender fees under PMC Agreement, since admittedly,
				<lb />
				post tender stage of project had not commenced on the date of
				<lb />
				termination of PMC Agreement and the Respondent has not carried out
				<lb />
				any post tender activities as outlined in PMC Agreement. Thus, the
				<lb />
				impugned award with respect to the claim for post tender fees of RS.42
				<lb />
				Crores was contrary to the express terms of PMC Agreement and in
				<lb />
				particular Clause 6.1(A) read with Appendix E-Part(II). It is submitted
				<lb />
				that as to how the Arbitral Tribunal could have awarded payment of any
				<lb />
				sum, let alone entire claim of Rs.42 crores, for post tender activities under
				<lb />
				PMC Agreement by unexplicably including this amount in its calculation
				<lb />
				of damages without any discussion or deliberation on this aspect.
				<lb />
				According to the petitioner, the Arbitral Tribunal has failed to apply its
				<lb />
				mind to the petitioner&apos;s contention and by not affording any reasons for
				<lb />
				awarding post-tender fees to the Respondent. The impugned award in this
				<lb />
				regard is patently contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxxiii)
				<lb />
				The Arbitral Tribunal has completely failed to consider and
				<lb />
				deal with the said several of the petitioner&apos;s arguments and submissions
				<lb />
				and provide reasons for rejecting or not accepting the same. To this extent
				<lb />
				the impugned award is unreasoned and in violation of principles of
				<lb />
				natural justice. This, according to the petitioner also demonstrates non
				<lb />
				application of mind on the part of Arbitral Tribunal and makes the
				<lb />
				impugned award an unreasoned award.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxxiv)
				<lb />
				Lastly it is submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal has failed to
				<lb />
				consider several important submissions made by the petitioner on several
				<lb />
				documents on record and in ignoring these contentions it can be said that,
				<lb />
				the Arbitral Tribunal has rendered an award ignoring vital and
				<lb />
				uncontroverted evidence to arrive at findings which are ex-facie perverse.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxxv)
				<lb />
				In supporting the above contentions Mr.Khambata, learned
				<lb />
				Senior Counsel for the petitioner has relied on the decisions of the
				<lb />
				Supreme Court in Associate Builders Versus Delhi Development Authority 5
				<lb />
				and the decision of the learned Single Judge in Fermenta Biotech Ltd.
				<lb />
				Versus K.R.Patel. 6
				<lb />
				Submissions on Behalf of the Respondent
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				35.
				<lb />
				On behalf of the respondents, Mr.Jagtiani learned senior
				<lb />
				counsel would make the following submissions :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(i)
				<lb />
				None of the grounds as urged on behalf of the petitioner
				<lb />
				warrant any interference under any of the limited grounds falling within
				<lb />
				Section 34 of the ACA. It is submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal has
				<lb />
				recorded findings on appreciating the documentary and oral evidence and
				<lb />
				has correctly come to a conclusion to award the damages as granted, in
				<lb />
				favour of the respondents.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(ii)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the termination of the PMC Agreement
				<lb />
				by the petitioner was illegal. There was no fault of the respondents which
				<lb />
				could have made the petitioner to terminate the PMC agreement by
				<lb />
				invoking clause 2.8.1 (g) of the PMC Agreement. This much less alleging
				<lb />
				on the ground that the respondent&apos;s demand of retention fees in
				<lb />
				pursuance of the first award and by claiming such amounts, would have
				<lb />
				an effect of a deemed repudiation of the contract. It is submitted that the
				<lb />
				Arbitral Tribunal in para nos. 22 to 26 of the award, has appropriately
				<lb />
				held that the respondents by demanding the retention fees, would not
				<lb />
				constitute repudiation of the PMC Agreement.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(iii)
				<lb />
				In regard to clause 2.8.1 (g) it is submitted that the pre-
				<lb />
				condition to termination was that the project &quot; not implemented and/or
				<lb />
				stopped and abandoned &quot;. According to the respondent, the Tribunal has
				<lb />
				interpreted this clause to mean that a permanent stoppage or non-
				<lb />
				implementation of the project and not a mere temporary break in the
				<lb />
				project. This is a reasonable and probable interpretation as made, by the
				<lb />
				Arbitral Tribunal to reach to conclusion that the termination is illegal. It is
				<lb />
				submitted that this is more so, for the reason that in the termination
				<lb />
				notice dated 4 August 2012 the petitioner itself stated that the project has
				<lb />
				only &quot;presently been stopped and is not being implemented&quot; .
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(iv)
				<lb />
				The respondents had led ample evidence before the Arbitral
				<lb />
				Tribunal to demonstrate, that the project was alive and kicking. Also that
				<lb />
				the DRP Officers had continued the work full time and DRP had never
				<lb />
				been cancelled. This was also clearly recognized by the Principal Secretary
				<lb />
				to the Hon&apos;ble Chief Minister, in internal note date 8 February, 2012. It is
				<lb />
				thus, submitted that after evidence was led by the respondent and when
				<lb />
				the Tribunal was ready to hear the submissions of the parties, the
				<lb />
				petitioner issued an advertisement dated 30 January 2016 followed by
				<lb />
				three or four successive extensions inviting bids in respect of same DRP as
				<lb />
				originally notified, in the G.R.dated 4 February 2004. These acts on the
				<lb />
				part of the petitioner falsified the contention that the project was
				<lb />
				permanently stopped and/or abandoned making clause 2.8.1 (g) of the
				<lb />
				contract in-applicable to justify the termination of the PMC Agreement.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(v)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that once the termination was established to
				<lb />
				be illegal, the consequence had to follow namely that the respondent be
				<lb />
				compensated by way of damages for loss of profit that the respondents
				<lb />
				was reasonably expected to make, had the PMC Agreement was to be
				<lb />
				implemented in its course.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(vi)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the petitioner&apos;s reading of clause 6.1 (b)
				<lb />
				which states that &quot; PMC shall additionally receive 0.5 % of the total a
				<lb />
				premium received by the SRA &quot; is mis-placed and cannot be invoked in a
				<lb />
				situation, when the termination of the contract by the petitioner was
				<lb />
				illegal. The petitioner&apos;s contention that unless the petitioner received the
				<lb />
				premium, the respondent was not entitled to be paid at the rate of 0.5 %
				<lb />
				of such premium, and that as no premium was received, the respondent
				<lb />
				was not entitled for such damages, is a fallacious argument. This, for the
				<lb />
				reason that non-receipt of the premium is a situation, that was brought
				<lb />
				about by the petitioner&apos;s own illegal conduct of wrongful termination of
				<lb />
				the PMC agreement. If such an argument is to be accepted, it would
				<lb />
				amount to adding a premium to an illegality and breach as perpetrated by
				<lb />
				the petitioner on the respondents.
				<lb />
				In this situation, damages to be
				<lb />
				awarded by way of loss of profit were required to be calculated albeit
				<lb />
				hypothetically as if the contract was allowed to run its full course.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(vii)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the respondent on evidence has
				<lb />
				established the loss of profit. In this context, it is submitted that the
				<lb />
				evidence of two expert witnesses was led
				<lb />
				by the respondents to
				<lb />
				determine loss of profit namely of Mr.Girish Ranade of Ballal Engineering,
				<lb />
				who calculated the cost of construction of the project, and secondly, of
				<lb />
				Ms.Gauri Shah of C.Chokshi who calculated a reasonable premium that
				<lb />
				would be earned by the petitioner. The Arbitral Tribunal on appreciation,
				<lb />
				of their testimony, accepted their evidence while observing that the
				<lb />
				petitioner had refrained from leading any evidence to either controvert or
				<lb />
				vary or substitute the conclusions of the respondent&apos;s witnesses. It is
				<lb />
				submitted that as regards, the respondent&apos;s witness Mr.Girish Ranade, his
				<lb />
				calculations were based on plans, specifications as contained in the tender
				<lb />
				document, which were prepared by the SRA itself and therefore, the
				<lb />
				material on the basis of which, Ballal Engineering had concluded the cost
				<lb />
				of project, were of the nature which emanated from the petitioner&apos;s
				<lb />
				documents and were fully within the petitioner&apos;s special knowledge and
				<lb />
				record. It is submitted that Mr.Girish Ranade&apos;s covering letter to the
				<lb />
				report in fact, specifically refers to the exact building within DRP and
				<lb />
				therefore, his calculations were not done on any hypothetical basis but, on
				<lb />
				the very same compensation as projected.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(viii)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the evidence of Ms.Gauri Shah gives an
				<lb />
				estimate of the reasonable premium that would be earned by the SRA
				<lb />
				which were also based on assumptions largely contained in the tender
				<lb />
				documents and based on recognized principles of valuation. Ms.Gauri
				<lb />
				Shah in her testimony has justified every assumption around which her
				<lb />
				calculations and projections were based. In this regard, it is submitted
				<lb />
				that she provided for a bandwidth ranging approximately Rs.23,000 crores
				<lb />
				to Rs.29,000 crores and the arbitral tribunal after adopting a conservative
				<lb />
				and a cautious approach, chose to accept a lowest figure of Rs.23,000/-
				<lb />
				crores as the basis for awarding damages.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(ix)
				<lb />
				It is next submitted that this is a case, where adverse
				<lb />
				inference was required to be drawn against the SRA and as rightly
				<lb />
				undertaken, in the impugned Arbitral Award. It is submitted that the
				<lb />
				disputes in arbitration revolved around as to whether the project had
				<lb />
				been permanently stopped and abandoned; what was the actual cost of
				<lb />
				the rehabilitation and saleable component of the project and what would
				<lb />
				be the reasonable expected premium had the PMC Agreement had been
				<lb />
				allowed to run its course. It is submitted that on each of these issues, the
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				petitioner had not only the domain knowledge but, also information and
				<lb />
				data in the form of drawings and specifications that would assist the
				<lb />
				Tribunal. in arriving at its decision. The facts pertaining to all these issues
				<lb />
				were within the special knowledge of the petitioner. It is submitted that
				<lb />
				notwithstanding this situation, the petitioner deliberately, chose not to
				<lb />
				lead any evidence and stop their witnesses to the testimony of cross-
				<lb />
				examination by the respondents so as to test the petitioner&apos;s defence and
				<lb />
				elicit the truth. It is submitted that it was petitioner&apos;s burden to prove the
				<lb />
				situation, the facts, which were within the special knowledge was on the
				<lb />
				petitioner, in accordance with sections 106 and 114 of the Evidence Act.
				<lb />
				The Arbitral Tribunal has in fact, severely commented on this aspect, has
				<lb />
				also considered the case laws on the subject, to the effect that adverse
				<lb />
				inference is required to be drawn against a party who could but, chose
				<lb />
				not to lead cogent evidence on the aspect within their knowledge and
				<lb />
				asserted the test of burden of proof.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(x)
				<lb />
				The statement of claim as filed by the respondents, was based
				<lb />
				on illegal termination of the contract in 2012 i.e. much prior to the said
				<lb />
				advertisement dated 30 January 2016 and hence, no reliance was placed
				<lb />
				upon such an advertisement and substantiate and establish the illegal
				<lb />
				termination. It is submitted that, when facts of the advertisement was
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				53
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				drawn to the attention of the Tribunal, an additional reason was provided
				<lb />
				to hold that the termination was illegal, as it demonstrated that the
				<lb />
				project was alive falsifying the assertion, that the project had been
				<lb />
				permanently stopped and abandoned. Being an additional piece of
				<lb />
				evidence, the Tribunal considered the same, concluded that the
				<lb />
				termination was illegal and did not satisfy the requirement of clause 2.8.1
				<lb />
				(g).
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(xi)
				<lb />
				The contention of the petitioner that as no bids were
				<lb />
				received, pursuant to the advertisement dated 30 January 2016 it was
				<lb />
				conclusively established that the project was un-viable and therefore,
				<lb />
				respondent&apos;s claim for loss of profit as awarded, was illegal and against
				<lb />
				the evidence brought on record is misconceived.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(xii)
				<lb />
				The petitioner&apos;s contention that the Arbitral Tribunal having
				<lb />
				admitted the advertisement in evidence and coming to a conclusion that
				<lb />
				the project was alive, cannot be a contradiction as the Tribunal has
				<lb />
				accepted that the advertisement proved that the project was alive, and as
				<lb />
				no bids were received, it necessarily had an impact on the question of loss
				<lb />
				of profit claimed by the respondent. This has been effectively dealt by the
				<lb />
				Arbitral Tribunal in paras 56 to 70 in as much as the Tribunal has found
				<lb />
				no casual connection, between non-receipt of bids and the advertisement
				<lb />
				dated 30 January 2016 by holding that non-receipt of bids could still be
				<lb />
				contradicted to the tender documents, which have been dis-similar to the
				<lb />
				ones prevalent in 2012 when the respondent was in-charge and six
				<lb />
				bidders had actually continued to show interest. This was partly
				<lb />
				acknowledged in the letter dated 9 March 2011. It is submitted that the
				<lb />
				witnesses who were examined on behalf of the petitioner, were also
				<lb />
				ignorant of the whole project and the tender documents and therefore,
				<lb />
				could not assign any reasons as to why no bids were received from the
				<lb />
				prospective bidders, may be for the cause that the tender conditions were
				<lb />
				not attractive for a sector. The Arbitral Tribunal has also noticed that no
				<lb />
				Senior Officer of the petitioner, with knowledge of the tender documents,
				<lb />
				offered himself for cross-examination and to testify the reasons, why no
				<lb />
				bids were received. The Tribunal therefore, correctly found that it was not
				<lb />
				sufficient for the petitioner to contend, that as no bids were received the
				<lb />
				project had in any manner come to a standstill. The Tribunal also was
				<lb />
				correct in its observation that the event of 2016 could not be understood
				<lb />
				in self-contained term, for that would be taking a restricted myophic view
				<lb />
				of the case and non-receipt of the bids in 2016, might be contracted on a
				<lb />
				situation that prevailed in 2012 when six bidders were short-listed for the
				<lb />
				project. There is thus no contradiction at all, in the various observations as
				<lb />
				made by the Tribunal.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(xiii)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the petitioner had miserably failed to
				<lb />
				show that the project was non-viable and unprofitable while admitting
				<lb />
				that the project was still an on-going endeavour as originally
				<lb />
				conceptualized
				<lb />
				by the respondents. It is submitted that the Arbitral
				<lb />
				Tribunal has been conservative for all the losses while turning down all
				<lb />
				other claims. It is submitted that there were no contradictions whatsoever
				<lb />
				in the impugned Award and the same is not in any manner, patently
				<lb />
				illegal.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xiv)
				<lb />
				It is next submitted that only the petitioner was competent to
				<lb />
				appraise the Arbitral Tribunal of whether the project had been
				<lb />
				permanently stopped and abandoned. However, the petitioner desisted
				<lb />
				from doing so until the issue was conclusively established against the
				<lb />
				petitioner by reference to advertisement dated 30.1.2016 as placed on
				<lb />
				record by the respondent which proved that DRP was alive.
				<lb />
				It is
				<lb />
				submitted that inference to be drawn from such conduct of the petitioner
				<lb />
				clearly establish respondent&apos;s case of illegal termination of contract by the
				<lb />
				petitioner and beyond any doubt inciting the Respondent to recover
				<lb />
				damages for loss and profit.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xv)
				<lb />
				In so far as to what was the actual cost of rehabilitation and
				<lb />
				saleable components of the project, it is submitted that the Ballal&apos;s
				<lb />
				estimate of cost was based upon the material gathered from record of the
				<lb />
				petitioner and particularly tendered documents. Thus every valid notion
				<lb />
				as to what was the project cost was within the special knowledge of SRA
				<lb />
				which by withholding (by not offering any witness for cross examination)
				<lb />
				makes
				<lb />
				the cross examination of Mr. Girish Ranade, hollow and
				<lb />
				inadequate in trying to dis-approve his testimony. In fact, there was no
				<lb />
				attempt by the petitioner while cross examining Girish Ranade to suggest
				<lb />
				alternate estimate of cost by leading evidence to that effect.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xvi)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that as to what would be reasonable expected
				<lb />
				premium had the PMC Agreement been allowed to run its course was
				<lb />
				appropriately considered by the Arbitral Tribunal in making the impugned
				<lb />
				award.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xvii)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the petitioner could have reasonably
				<lb />
				undertaken an exercise of estimating the premium when the &quot;would be
				<lb />
				developers&quot;, bidding in the project would pay on successful bid.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xviii)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that only on that basis that tendered document
				<lb />
				would contain pre-requisites of eligibility in inviting bids. This was also
				<lb />
				evident in the light of differing bidding requirements of different Sectors,
				<lb />
				in 2016 tenders. Reference in that regard is made to Clause 2.1.18(B) of
				<lb />
				the tender documents for Sector 1 to 4 as submitted by the respondent. It
				<lb />
				is further submitted that Ms. Gauri Shah had based her valuation on
				<lb />
				internationally accepted principles and assumptions which have been
				<lb />
				tested but unshaken in detail and ineffective cross examination. Also
				<lb />
				failure on the part of the petitioner to lead its own evidence, could be the
				<lb />
				only method by which Ms.Gauri Shah&apos;s valuation could be questioned. In
				<lb />
				the absence of the petitioner leading any evidence, Gauri Shah&apos;s testimony
				<lb />
				was required to be accepted in its totality.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xix)
				<lb />
				It is next submitted that an adverse inference in the context of
				<lb />
				petitioner&apos;s letter dated 9 th March 2011 was necessary to be drawn. It is
				<lb />
				submitted that this letter of the petitioner destroyed all the defence that
				<lb />
				the SRA had, to the claim of respondent in the letter dated 9 th March
				<lb />
				2011. This letter was obtained by the respondent under Right to
				<lb />
				Information Act. This letter demonstrated that this letter was internal
				<lb />
				communication from OSD-DRP to the Secretary Housing department to
				<lb />
				appoint MHADA as developer for Sector 5 of DRP by cancelling the then
				<lb />
				existing process and to some how find an excuse to terminate the services
				<lb />
				of the respondent as Project Management Consultant. It is submitted that
				<lb />
				contents of the said letter stands completely established for following
				<lb />
				reasons;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				a) Petitioner ought to have led evidence if it wanted to
				<lb />
				disassociate or water down effect of the said letter, it was only
				<lb />
				petitioner who was in position to explain the context in which
				<lb />
				admissions contained in said letter were made. If this was so,
				<lb />
				the question of project being profitable and that too to the
				<lb />
				extent of 31156 crores become a conclusive effect.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				b) The purport of the said letter being to terminate respondent
				<lb />
				services and to appoint MHADA as developer in respect of Sector
				<lb />
				5, both being achieved, the petitioner was constructively
				<lb />
				stopped from contending that the letter should be understood in
				<lb />
				any other manner except as what it actually stated.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				c) The contents of this letter met the testimony of Ms.Gauri
				<lb />
				Shah and Mr.Ranade unassailable and in fact completely
				<lb />
				corroborated their statements and showed that same were not
				<lb />
				only extremely reasonable but conservative as well.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				d)
				<lb />
				That a reference of this letter was seen in the
				<lb />
				appointment letter dated 21 st May 2011 of MHADA for Sector 5,
				<lb />
				thereby ratifying pre-eminence accorded to this documentary
				<lb />
				evidence.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				e) The said letter also afforded an insight as to why SRA chose
				<lb />
				not to examine any witness of its own as if this was to happen.
				<lb />
				These witnesses could have confirmed the case of the
				<lb />
				respondent on all material aspects of the case namely illegal
				<lb />
				termination and estimated loss and profit which would follow
				<lb />
				on such termination.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				(xx)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that it was not open for the petitioner to give
				<lb />
				any other meaning to the said letter dated 9 th March 2011 before this
				<lb />
				Court in the present proceedings for the reason that the SRA had chosen
				<lb />
				not to examine any witness in this regard and thus, before this Court now
				<lb />
				was precluded from giving a spin or interpretation of its own to the
				<lb />
				contents of said letter dated 9 th March 2011.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				(xxi)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that in any case, such letter dated 9 th March
				<lb />
				2011, was written primarily to get rid of respondent and to appoint
				<lb />
				MHADA as a Project Management Consultant. As both objectives were
				<lb />
				achieved, all other contents of the letter must be read as understood by
				<lb />
				the respondent and in no other manner.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				xxii)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that Rs.31,156 crore was in fact indicative of
				<lb />
				premium and the gross profits the figure of which was arrived by taking
				<lb />
				profit at 62,313 crores and by presuming that the developer would have
				<lb />
				share of 50% of 62, 313 crore as indicated in the said letter.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				(xxiii)
				<lb />
				It is further submitted that the petitioner&apos;s contention that
				<lb />
				those bidders who left each one of whom would have got one sector and
				<lb />
				thereby competition was avoided, was an erroneous interpretation which
				<lb />
				could not have been accepted in the absence of any evidence through such
				<lb />
				witnesses who authored the letter. It could well be that all bidders would
				<lb />
				bid for a single sector, which when awarded the remaining unsuccessful
				<lb />
				bidders would bid for the remaining available sectors.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				(xxiv)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that there was conundrum faced by the
				<lb />
				petitioner, it is submitted that at the virtual fag end of the arbitral
				<lb />
				proceedings that is before oral submissions, advertisement dated 30 th
				<lb />
				January 2016 was issued which unequivocally demonstrated that DRP was
				<lb />
				a subsisting and ongoing project under the same G.R. dated 4 th February
				<lb />
				2004. This, according to the respondents nailed the petitioner&apos;s lie that
				<lb />
				the project had been permanent stopped and abandoned so as to attract
				<lb />
				termination of Clause 2.8.1(g).
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxv)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that the petitioner was allowed to file reply to
				<lb />
				explain the said advertisement.
				<lb />
				Pursuant thereto on 24.8.2016, the
				<lb />
				petitioner intended to show that though fresh global tenders were floated
				<lb />
				in respect of DRP, same failed to attract any bids and thereby
				<lb />
				demonstrating that the project was unviable and unprofitable.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxvi)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that in the additional affidavit-in-reply dated
				<lb />
				19.8.2016, the petitioner stated that no bidders were attracted and
				<lb />
				showed interest in the project, no final bid materialized. To prove these
				<lb />
				aspects, SRA chose to lead the evidence of 3 lower ranked officers who in
				<lb />
				their cross examination pleaded total ignorance of any of the above facts
				<lb />
				as was evident from various answers to pointed questions put to them in
				<lb />
				cross-examination. To support these contentions, reference is made to
				<lb />
				cross examination of RW 1 (Mr.Harish Varade), question Nos.4 to 12, 14,
				<lb />
				20 to 26 and of the cross examination of RW 2 (MrM.R.Gadekar) to
				<lb />
				question Nos.1 to 9, 16, 27 to 29 and to the cross examination of RW 3
				<lb />
				(Mr.Harshad Karade) to question Nos. 6 to 20. It is thus, submitted that
				<lb />
				these 3 witnesses were offered for cross examination despite the fact that
				<lb />
				Mr. R.B.Sankhe, Mr. S.K. Joshi and Mr. S.B.Satam who were authors of
				<lb />
				advertisement
				<lb />
				dated
				<lb />
				30 th
				<lb />
				January
				<lb />
				2016
				<lb />
				and
				<lb />
				who
				<lb />
				were
				<lb />
				attending/participating in arbitral proceedings on regular basis, were
				<lb />
				deliberately not offered for cross-examination. It is submitted that
				<lb />
				obviously said 3 persons possessed all requisite knowledge relating to the
				<lb />
				contents of additional affidavit-in-reply but were shielded, as it were, from
				<lb />
				being exposed to cross-examination by respondent/claimant.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxvii)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that in any event even assuming that no bids
				<lb />
				were proved to have been received pursuant to the advertisement dated
				<lb />
				30 th January 2016, the circumstance could have had no bearing on the
				<lb />
				facts and situation that had obtained in 2012, when the PMC agreement
				<lb />
				was illegally terminated. In this context, it is submitted that under
				<lb />
				respondent&apos;s appointment (pre-termination) admitted position was that
				<lb />
				there were six bidders whose interest in developing one of the sectors of
				<lb />
				DRP remained intact for almost 4 years, ever since the tenders were first
				<lb />
				floated in 2007.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(xxviii)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that even non-receipt of bid did not
				<lb />
				prove that the project was unviable as there can be numerous reasons why
				<lb />
				no bids can be received, which can be for the reasons of there being
				<lb />
				onerous tender conditions for e.g. one of the conditions may be
				<lb />
				demanding a hefty earnest money deposit as qualifying for the contract
				<lb />
				which the developer may not find reasonable or affordable or stipulating
				<lb />
				that SRA terminated development agreement in an arbitrary or one sided
				<lb />
				manner. Such condition would certainly inhibit or deter an otherwise
				<lb />
				bidder from consummating the transaction with the petitioner/SRA.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(xxix)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that if the petitioner wanted to prove that the
				<lb />
				project was unviable then the petitioner should have led cogent evidence
				<lb />
				to demonstrate that cost of the project exceeds sales receipts which they
				<lb />
				did not do.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(xxx)
				<lb />
				It is submitted that when asked directly by the Arbitral
				<lb />
				Tribunal, the petitioner desisted from saying that project was unviable. As
				<lb />
				clearly commented by the Tribunal in paragraph 56 to 70 of the award as
				<lb />
				also conclusion arrived at was that the petitioner/SRA miserably failed to
				<lb />
				establish unviability or lack of potential profitability of the project. Thus,
				<lb />
				the advertisement dated 30 th January 2016, nailed the lie that the project
				<lb />
				was permanently stopped and abandoned and therefore, makes the
				<lb />
				termination wholly illegal vis-a-vis Clause 2.8.1(g). Also, failure to offer
				<lb />
				knowledgeable witness to substantiate contents of additional affidavit
				<lb />
				brought about a situation that contents of additional affidavit unproved
				<lb />
				and unacceptable.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				xxxi)
				<lb />
				It is next submitted that contention of the petitioner that
				<lb />
				there is internal contradiction in the award is untenable. It is submitted
				<lb />
				that the said contention of the petitioner was fallacious for several
				<lb />
				reasons. Firstly, it is submitted that the Tribunal independent of the
				<lb />
				advertisement dated 30 th January 2016 has held that, on interpretation of
				<lb />
				termination Claus 2.8.1(g) of the PMC Agreement the termination does
				<lb />
				not meet with the requirement of the said Clause of PMC Agreement. Also,
				<lb />
				termination notice dated 4.8.2012 also stated that the project was
				<lb />
				&quot;presently not implemented or stopped or abandoned&quot;. Whereas, on
				<lb />
				interpretation of Clause 2.8.1(g) the Arbitral Tribunal has held that only a
				<lb />
				permanent stoppage and abandonment would entitle SRA to terminate
				<lb />
				PMC Agreement. It is submitted that thus, the Arbitral Tribunal has held
				<lb />
				termination to be illegal on its own terms and observed in paragraphs 27,
				<lb />
				28 and 30 of the impugned award.
				<lb />
				It is thus, submitted that
				<lb />
				interpretation of Clause 2.8.1 (g) as made by the Arbitral Tribunal was bot
				<lb />
				reasonable, correct and probable interpretation.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(xxxii)
				<lb />
				In opposing the Petitioner&apos;s contention on repudiation, on
				<lb />
				behalf of the respondents, reliance is placed on : (1) Freeth and Anr
				<lb />
				v.Burr 7 ; (2) Sweet v.Maxwell 8 and (3) Woodar V. Wimpey 9)
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				In regard to the proposition on loss of profit, reliance is placed on the
				<lb />
				decision in Union of India vs Vaman Prestresssing Co.Ltd and Anr 10 ,
				<lb />
				K.K.Co-operative Group Housing Society Ltd vs Goel Assoc iaes 11 , Nobel et

				Reasons
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				36.
				<lb />
				To appreciate the contentions, at the outset it would be
				<lb />
				necessary to note some undisputed facts.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				37.
				<lb />
				Dharavi being one of the biggest slum pockets in Asia and
				<lb />
				located in a central area in Mumbai being spread over in an area of about
				<lb />
				174 Ha of land, the Government of Maharashtra in or about 2004 desired
				<lb />
				re-development of Dharavi for economic upliftment of persons who are
				<lb />
				occupying these slum areas. There cannot be two opinions of the public
				<lb />
				need felt by the State Government to undertake this herculean task to
				<lb />
				rehabilitate those suffering in these slums.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				38.
				<lb />
				Accordingly, on 4 February 2004, the Government of
				<lb />
				Maharashtra in its Housing department issued a Government Resolution
				<lb />
				inter-alia notifying its decision for re-development of Dharavi. Some of
				<lb />
				the salient features for this re-development were that the re-development
				<lb />
				would be undertaken through public-private participation by dividing
				<lb />
				Dharavi into 9 Sectors, with expected expenditure of RS.5600 crores as
				<lb />
				sanctioned. Zoning and Sectors as proposed in the Dharavi re-
				<lb />
				development plan were sanctioned. A Committee of Secretaries was
				<lb />
				empowered to modify the extent of Sectors and number of Sectors to be
				<lb />
				proposed under Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP). The
				<lb />
				implementation of DRP was to be as per the existing norms and
				<lb />
				regulations of a Slum Rehabilitation Scheme, under Slum Rehabilitation
				<lb />
				Authority/Petitioner. The developers were to submit plans for
				<lb />
				development of individual sectors and the sectoral development was to be
				<lb />
				carried out in phases. The DRP was to be published through global
				<lb />
				tendering system. Bids received were to be scrutinized by the
				<lb />
				SRA/petitioner and submitted to the Committee of Secretaries (CoS) for a
				<lb />
				final decision. Scrutiny of bidders was to be done by the SRA/petitioner
				<lb />
				which would be put forth before the Committee as recorded in paragraph
				<lb />
				3 of the said Government Resolution. After sanction from the COS to the
				<lb />
				proposal of developers for individual sectorial development,
				<lb />
				SRA/petitioner was to take further action. The Urban Development
				<lb />
				Department ( in short &quot;UDD&quot; ) of the Government of Maharashtra was to
				<lb />
				complete the formalities of declaration of SRA/petitioner as a Special
				<lb />
				Planning Authority for Dharavi. Condition of obtaining consent from 70%
				<lb />
				slum dwellers by development was relaxed to 60% in order to expedite
				<lb />
				implementation of DRP. Consumption of FSI upto 4% was sanctioned only
				<lb />
				for Dharavi area. Sanction was granted to the utilization/availing of any
				<lb />
				FSI generated beyond 4.00 under Dharavi re-development as slum TDR.
				<lb />
				The Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay was to plan in detail about
				<lb />
				basic infrastructure facilities. The Urban Development Department of the
				<lb />
				Government of Maharashtra, was to follow up with the Central
				<lb />
				Government for the funds required for infrastructure facilities. According
				<lb />
				to the plan, construction was to first commence on the Government of
				<lb />
				Maharashtra and Municipal Corporation for Greater Mumbai land. The
				<lb />
				Government of India was to be requested to give NOC on their land.
				<lb />
				Acquisition of private lands was to be initiated under MHADA Act 1971.
				<lb />
				Officer on special duty (I.A.S.) was to be appointed for the project. All
				<lb />
				expenses of this Officer were to be borne by the SRA. It is important to
				<lb />
				note Clause 16 of this Government Resolution which makes a reference to
				<lb />
				the Chairman of the Respondent Mr. Mukesh Mehta which reads as
				<lb />
				under:
				<lb />

				<lb />
				apart from the proceeding, the concept of Dharavi

				meetings at Delhi, Mr. Mukesh Mehta is hereby appointed as
				<lb />
				Advisor/Consultant for Dharavi re-development. As regards
				<lb />
				fees and terms of reference, same will be decided by the
				<lb />
				Committee of Secretaries and expenses will be borne by the

				SRA.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				39.
				<lb />
				The aforesaid Government Resolution which is of the year
				<lb />
				2004, is the first pointer to the role of Mr. Mukesh Mehta in the DRP so
				<lb />
				contemplated, who was appointed as an Advisor/Consultant. It is
				<lb />
				required to be noted that at the time of issuance of above Government
				<lb />
				Resolution, there is nothing to infer that, Respondent -M.M. Project
				<lb />
				Consultants Private Limited had any direct privity either with the
				<lb />
				Government of Maharashtra or with the petitioner.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				40.
				<lb />
				In pursuance of the recognition of Mr.Mukesh Mehta as an
				<lb />
				Advisor/Consultant for the DRP to be undertaken by the Petitioner, a
				<lb />
				formal Agreement namely the &quot;PMC Agreement&quot; dated 1.11.2008 came to
				<lb />
				be entered between the petitioner through its &apos;Officer on Special Duty
				<lb />
				(OSD)&apos; and the Respondent M/s M.M. Project Consultant Private Limited,
				<lb />
				through its Chairman Mr. Mukesh Mehta who was authorized by the
				<lb />
				Resolution of Board of Directors dated 10 th October 2008 to execute the
				<lb />
				said Agreement on behalf of the Respondent.

				<lb />
				nature of the findings as recorded by the arbitral tribunal. Also

				Mr.Khambata, learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioner has raised
				<lb />
				categorical contentions that the impugned award ignores various clauses

				of the PMC agreement and/or there is non application of mind to the
				<lb />

				<lb />
				Considering the submissions as advanced on behalf of the
				<lb />
				parties in the context of the legality of the impugned award as assailed by
				<lb />
				the Petitioner, the adjudication of this petition would involve examining
				<lb />
				the impugned award and the findings as recorded therein on the following
				<lb />
				points:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				(i)
				<lb />
				As to whether the Respondent repudiated the PMC agreement ?
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				(ii) As to whether the termination of the contract/PMC agreement by
				<lb />
				the petitioner was legal and valid ?
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				(iii) Whether the arbitral tribunal is correct in law and facts in awarding
				<lb />
				damages ?
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				43.
				<lb />
				The discussion on the above points is as under :-
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				(i) Whether the Respondent repudiated the PMC agreement.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				44.
				<lb />
				To appreciate the concept of repudiation of a contract, a
				<lb />
				useful reference can be made to the Halsbury&apos;s Laws of England, 5 th
				<lb />
				Edition, Vol.22 which would explain &apos;repudiation&apos; as under:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				560.
				<lb />
				Repudiation and anticipatory breach. Instead of merely
				<lb />
				failing to provide due performance at the stipulated time, one party may
				<lb />
				put himself in breach by evincing an intention, by words or conduct, of
				<lb />
				repudiating his obligations under the contract in some essential respect. It
				<lb />
				has been said that repudiation is a serious matter, not to be lightly found or
				<lb />
				inferred. Such repudiation may occur at the time fixed for performance or
				<lb />
				before that time, in the latter case it is known as &apos;anticipatory breach&apos;.
				<lb />
				Repudiation will give the innocent party (B) the right to treat the
				<lb />
				contract as discharged and claim damages. It may be express or implied.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				561. Repudiation must go to the root of the contract. Not every refusal
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				by A to perform a part of the contract amounts to a repudiation which
				<lb />
				entitles the other party (B) to treat the contract as at an end; there must be
				<lb />
				a refusal to perform something which goes to the root or essence of the
				<lb />
				contract. Thus it is not just any delay in breach of contract which amounts
				<lb />
				to a repudiation, but only such delay as would frustrate the adventure.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				The question whether the refusal to perform part of the contract amounts
				<lb />
				to a repudiation of the whole contract depends on the construction of the
				<lb />
				contract and the circumstances of the case. The test is the same for both
				<lb />
				repudiation and anticipatory breach.
				<lb />
				If the agreement is an entire
				<lb />
				contract, the test is applied to repudiation of any part of it.
				<lb />
				If the
				<lb />
				agreement is construed as a series of separate contracts, prima facie no
				<lb />
				breach of one contract can be a repudiation of the others; whereas, if the
				<lb />
				contract is divisible, the question is whether repudiation of a divisible part
				<lb />
				shows an intention to repudiate the contract as a whole.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				562.
				<lb />
				Express and implied repudiation. Repudiation may be an
				<lb />
				express renunciation of contractual obligations by one party (A). This will
				<lb />
				be so whether A absolutely refuses to perform his side of the bargain or
				<lb />
				unambiguously asserts that he will be unable to do so. However, it is more
				<lb />
				commonly implied from failure to render due performance or, in cases of
				<lb />
				anticipatory breach, by the party in default putting himself in such a
				<lb />
				position that he will apparently be unable to perform when the time comes.
				<lb />
				A party (B) seeking to rely on repudiation implied from conduct must show
				<lb />
				that the party in default has so conducted himself as to lead a reasonable
				<lb />
				person to believe that he will not perform or will be unable to perform at
				<lb />
				the stipulated time; as where A refuses to perform unless B complies with
				<lb />
				requirements not contained in the contract.
				<lb />
				The fact that a breach is
				<lb />
				deliberate is not of itself sufficient but it is a factor which may taken into
				<lb />
				account as evidence of an intention no longer to be bound by the contract;
				<lb />
				not will words and conduct which do not amount to a renunciation of the
				<lb />
				contract.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				565.
				<lb />
				Rights of innocent party in case of repudiatory breach: in
				<lb />
				general. A distinction must be drawn according to whether or not
				<lb />
				performance of any promise was due before the repudiatory breach
				<lb />
				occurred; since in no case does the breach of contract terminate that
				<lb />
				contract ab initio. Rights which have already accrued before termination
				<lb />
				remain unaffected. Thus the innocent party (B) remains entitled to
				<lb />
				damages in respect of prior breaches by A3, and may recover in restitution
				<lb />
				any money he has paid A where there has been a total failure of
				<lb />
				consideration, or as regards any benefit conferred. At common law, A as
				<lb />
				the party in breach is entitled to damages in respect of any prior breach by
				<lb />
				B6, though he will not be able to recover any forfeitable deposit unless
				<lb />
				there has been a total failure of consideration, but equity may grant some
				<lb />
				relief against forfeiture.
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				A repudiatory breach of contract by A will not of itself have the effect of
				<lb />
				discharging the contract de futuro. Rather, it has the effect of giving the
				<lb />
				innocent party (B) a prima facie right to elect whether he will treat the
				<lb />
				contract as at an end or as still on foot as regards future obligations in it.
				<lb />
				The contract does not come to an end and therefore, in assessing damages,
				<lb />
				the court will have to have regard to its terms, including those obligations
				<lb />
				due to be performed subsequently and any exemption clause or liquidated
				<lb />
				damages clause. Disputes arising from the contract continue to be
				<lb />
				governed by any arbitration clause.&quot;.. … ..
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				566.
				<lb />
				Rights of innocent party in case of repudiatory breach: effect
				<lb />
				of termination. If the innocent party (B) can and does elect to terminate
				<lb />
				following a repudiatory breach by the other party (A), all the primary
				<lb />
				obligations of the parties under the contract which have not yet been
				<lb />
				performed are terminated. This termination does not prejudice the rights of
				<lb />
				the party so electing to claim damages (B) from the party in repudiatory
				<lb />
				breach (A) for any loss sustained in consequence of the non-performance by
				<lb />
				A of his primary obligations under the contract, future as well as past. Nor
				<lb />
				does the termination deprive the party in repudiatory breach (A) of the
				<lb />
				right to claim, or to set off, damages for any past non-performance by the
				<lb />
				other party (B) of that other party&apos;s own primary obligations, due to be
				<lb />
				performed before the contract was terminated. Thus the innocent party (B)
				<lb />
				is released from further liability to perform (subject perhaps to any express
				<lb />
				contrary provisions of the contract); and, for the &apos;primary&apos; obligation of the
				<lb />
				defaulting party to perform, there is substituted by operation of law a
				<lb />
				&apos;secondary&apos; obligation to pay damages for the loss resulting from failure to
				<lb />
				perform the primary obligation. However, prior liabilities remain: where a
				<lb />
				creditor accepts his debtor&apos;s default as terminating the contract, this does
				<lb />
				not release a guarantor who remains liable for moneys payable by the
				<lb />
				debtor after the date of discharge. Neither does the termination affect
				<lb />
				unpaid sums due before that time, but payments falling due before
				<lb />
				termination may be recoverable on some other ground, for example failure
				<lb />
				of consideration.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				A party to a contract thus either expressly or by implication can take
				<lb />
				a position that the other party to the contract would not be performing its
				<lb />
				obligation under the contract and that the contract accordingly would
				<lb />
				come to an end.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				45.
				<lb />
				In this context, the contractual background as pointed out by
				<lb />
				Mr. Khambatta, is required to be noted to appreciate as to whether the
				<lb />
				arbitral award is oblivious to and/or unmindful of the contractual
				<lb />
				conditions. As seen from the PMC agreement the role of the respondent
				<lb />
				as a Project Management Consultant (PMC) was specified in Appendix-A
				<lb />
				to the PMC Agreement which was divided into &apos;pre-tender&apos; activities and
				<lb />
				&apos;post-tender activities&apos;. The work of the respondent was in regard to the
				<lb />
				preparation of certain plans, survey maps, plans for existing land used and
				<lb />
				preparation of complete proposal alongwith layout/building plan with
				<lb />
				details of land for proposed transit camp and preparation of detail draft
				<lb />
				with report for sector-wise layout plan which were contained in Items 1 to
				<lb />
				7 under the head pre-tender activities in Appendix -A. The other items
				<lb />
				namely from item 8 to item 28, mostly provided for the respondent &apos;to
				<lb />
				assist&apos; the petitioner in several activities. Similarly under the head post-
				<lb />
				tender activities, which contain items 1 to 39, again majority of activities
				<lb />
				were &apos;to assist&apos; the SRA under DRP. In short as urged by Mr. Khambatta
				<lb />
				learned senior counsel for the petitioner, activities of the respondent
				<lb />
				under the PMC agreement were defined with quite certainty , relevant for
				<lb />
				the payment of the percentage of fees as fixed and specified in the last
				<lb />
				columns of the relevant appendix.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				46.
				<lb />
				For all the pre-tender and post-tender activities it was agreed
				<lb />
				between the parties that the total (outer limit) of the
				<lb />
				remuneration/payment to be made to the respondent was as agreed in
				<lb />
				Clause 6. It is significant that the basis for respondent&apos;s fees was the
				<lb />
				project cost which was notified four years prior to PMC Agreement being
				<lb />
				entered namely as referred to in paragraph (1) of the Government
				<lb />
				Resolution dated 4 th February 2004, declared to be Rs.5600 crores and the
				<lb />
				same was included in the PMC agreement. This is clearly seen from Clause
				<lb />
				6.1 (A) when it says NB &quot;PMC shall be restricted to 1% of Rs.5600 crores
				<lb />
				only, as described hereunder.&quot;. Accordingly, following was to be the
				<lb />
				respondent&apos;s remuneration as per Clause 6.1.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				i)
				<lb />
				25% of 1% of Rs.5600 crores i.e. 14
				<lb />
				crores
				<lb />
				towards
				<lb />
				pre-tender activities as per break up of
				<lb />
				percentage fees as set
				<lb />
				out in Appendix-E of the PMC
				<lb />
				Agreement [ Clause 6.1(A)(i) ].
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				ii)
				<lb />
				Balance 75% of 1% of Rs.5600 crores i.e. an amount of Rs.42
				<lb />
				crores toward post-tender activities as per break up of percentage
				<lb />
				fees as set out in Appendix -E [ Clause 6.1 (A)(ii) ].
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				iii) Additional entitlement to receive 0.5% of the total premium
				<lb />
				received by the petitioner/SRA to be released to the respondent
				<lb />
				within 30 days from submission of bill by the respondent [ Clause
				<lb />
				6.1(B) ].
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				47.
				<lb />
				It is not in dispute that the entire 25% of the 1% i.e. amount
				<lb />
				of Rs.14 crores towards pre-tender activities has been received by the
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				respondent. As to what was the position taken by the Respondent qua the
				<lb />
				fees/amounts to be received/paid to the Respondent by the Petitioner
				<lb />
				under the contract interaila after the first award is very crucial, to consider
				<lb />
				the Petitioner&apos;s contention on repudiation.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				48.
				<lb />
				After the award was pronounced in the first Arbitration on
				<lb />
				21 st June 2012, the respondent by its letter dated 25 th June 2012 raised
				<lb />
				an invoice of the same date, demanding from the petitioner, payment of
				<lb />
				retention amount which was being retained by the petitioner in
				<lb />
				accordance with Clause 6.4 of the PMC Agreement, which the petitioner
				<lb />
				was actually required to pay to the respondent only on completion of the
				<lb />
				project. The petitioner accordingly, urged before the Arbitral Tribunal that
				<lb />
				once the respondent demanded the retention amount which as per Clause
				<lb />
				6.4 was payable on completion of the project, such act on the part of the
				<lb />
				respondent, was an act of repudiation of PMC Agreement. It was urged
				<lb />
				that once the respondent repudiated the Contract, the respondent could
				<lb />
				not have claimed damages to be put in a better position than the
				<lb />
				respondent stood at the time of repudiation. The Petitioner had urged that
				<lb />
				the act of repudiation of the contract by the Respondent stood
				<lb />
				compounded by the Respondent&apos;s further confirmation of the position
				<lb />
				taken by it. This by pointing out that the Petitioner had felt aggrieved by
				<lb />
				the award of Arbitral Tribunal passed in first Arbitration before this Court,
				<lb />
				and succeeded in its challenge, in as much as the award partly came to be
				<lb />
				set aside. However in the Course of the said proceedings before this Court,
				<lb />
				the Respondent&apos;s justified its demand of the retention money as seen from
				<lb />
				what this Court recorded in its Order dated 14 th November 2014 in
				<lb />
				Arbitration No.1130 of 2012. Paragraph 8 of the said order is required to
				<lb />
				be noted which reads thus:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;8.Mr.Jagtiani, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
				<lb />
				Respondent, however, referred to the following three documents,
				<lb />
				namely, Internal Note of Housing Department dated 19-9-2010,
				<lb />
				Housing Department Resolution dated 26 February 2010 and the
				<lb />
				Petitioner&apos;s letter dated 14 th March 2012 addressed to the
				<lb />
				Respondent.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				Mr. Jagtiani also referred to the following
				<lb />
				circumstances namely,
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				i) there were no disputes between the parties that the
				<lb />
				Respondent was entitled to payment of Rs.14 crores for pre-tender
				<lb />
				activities.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				ii) there was admittedly no deficiency of service on the part of the
				<lb />
				respondent.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				iii)that the project has been suspended by the petitioner over
				<lb />
				which the Respondent had no control.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				iv) the project was modified by the Government and the
				<lb />
				Respondent had no say over the modifications and
				<lb />
				v) that the tender activities were abandoned by the Petitioner and
				<lb />
				MHADA was appointed as a Developer for the project.&quot;
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				49.
				<lb />
				It needs to be observed that issue before this Court in the
				<lb />
				earlier Arbitration Petition, which challenged the arbitral award as
				<lb />
				rendered in the first Arbitration, was not as to whether the PMC
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				84
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				agreement stood repudiated on the Respondent demanding retention
				<lb />
				amount and thus, necessarily the issue on repudiation of contract could
				<lb />
				have been validly urged by the petitioner in the present second
				<lb />
				Arbitration.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				50.
				<lb />
				Form the above contentions of the Respondents as raised
				<lb />
				before this Court, two important facets were evident on record, firstly, that
				<lb />
				it was the respondent&apos;s own contention that project was suspended by the
				<lb />
				Petitioner and the tender activities were abandoned by the petitioner, and
				<lb />
				that MHADA was appointed as developer for the said project; Secondly,
				<lb />
				the respondent having acquiesced to this factual/contractual position, the
				<lb />
				Respondent still maintained that it was entitled to the retention amount as
				<lb />
				awarded by arbitral tribunal.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				51.
				<lb />
				It is on the above backdrop and on sufficiently clear
				<lb />
				circumstances, as prevailing and understood between the parties that the
				<lb />
				contract had come to a stand still, the Respondent demanded the retention
				<lb />
				amount post the arbitral award. The Respondent also justified its
				<lb />
				demand.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				52.
				<lb />
				On the above conspectus as contended by Mr.Khambata, it
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				was legitimate and natural for the petitioner to terminate the Contract
				<lb />
				which the petitioner did by its termination notice dated 4 th August 2012.
				<lb />
				In the termination notice the petitioner inter-alia recorded that Expression
				<lb />
				of Interest (EOI) which were called on 31 st May 2007 by issuing global
				<lb />
				advertisements, under which only six bidders were left in the fray for five
				<lb />
				sectors,hence no competition remained in the global bidding process. It
				<lb />
				was recorded that therefore a decision was taken on 16 th May 2011 to
				<lb />
				cancel bidding process. It was also recorded that on 21 st May 2011 a
				<lb />
				decision was taken to allot redevelopment of Sector 5 to MHADA and that
				<lb />
				further on 28 th November 2011 and 15 th June 2012 DRP-SRA submitted
				<lb />
				alternative proposals to the State Government for re-development of
				<lb />
				Sector 3 and Sectors 1 to 4 respectively, which were based on the concept
				<lb />
				of cluster development. In paragraph 6 of the termination letter, it was
				<lb />
				recorded that the respondent demanding retention amount was an act of
				<lb />
				respondent repudiating the Contract. Relevant paragraphs of termination
				<lb />
				letter are crucial and are required to be extracted and reads thus;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				6.
				<lb />
				You had made various claims outside the provisions of the
				<lb />
				captioned agreement giving rise to dispute between the parties.
				<lb />
				Hence, it was decided to go in for arbitration as provided in the
				<lb />
				captioned agreement for resolution of various disputes. In the
				<lb />
				arbitration proceedings an award dated 21 st June 2012 has been
				<lb />
				made by which we have interalia been directed to pay you, certain
				<lb />
				amounts that had been retained by us, while making payments to
				<lb />
				you, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. You have
				<lb />
				thereafter addressed to us a letter dated 25 th June 2012 enclosing
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				various invoices, interalia calling upon us to pay you the retained
				<lb />
				amounts. The demand by you for payment of amounts retained
				<lb />
				as per Clause 6.4 of the Agreement is contrary to the terms and
				<lb />
				conditions of the Agreement and makes it clear that you are
				<lb />
				treating the Agreement as having come to an end and/or are in
				<lb />
				any event, repudiating the same.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				53.
				<lb />
				In my opinion there is much substance in the contentions as
				<lb />
				raised by the petitioner that the Respondent had clearly repudiated the
				<lb />
				contract, which is clear from aforesaid material/evidence on record.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				54.
				<lb />
				The Respondent&apos;s intention to repudiate the contract could
				<lb />
				also be clearly gathered from the respondent&apos;s reply to the termination
				<lb />
				letter being its Advocate&apos;s letter dated 23 August 2012. What is pertinent
				<lb />
				to be seen is that, in regard to the contention of the petitioner on
				<lb />
				repudiation, the Respondents justified its demand for release of the
				<lb />
				retention amount, despite the first arbitral award to that effect being set
				<lb />
				aside by this Court, in Arbitration Petition No. 1130 of 2012. The
				<lb />
				following Statement of the respondents, in the said letter dated 23 August
				<lb />
				2012 addressed to the petitioner is required to be noted and which reads
				<lb />
				thus :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;
				<lb />
				As stated hereinabove there is no cause made out by you in
				<lb />
				your letter under reply and as such your invocation of Clause 2.8.1
				<lb />
				(g) of the PMC Agreement is wholly untenable. Our client
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				confirms and reiterates the invoices sent to you with its letter
				<lb />
				dated 25 June 2012, and submits that submission of invoices
				<lb />
				pursuant to the arbitration Award by no stretch of imagination
				<lb />
				could mean that our client allegedly wants to terminate/repudiate
				<lb />
				the PMC Agreement. In fact his plea to convene a CoS meeting to
				<lb />
				resolve the issues has fallen on deaf ears. &quot;
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				55.
				<lb />
				It is, on this background, the Petitioner interalia in para 5.10
				<lb />
				and para 8 in its reply to the Statement of claim raised a specific
				<lb />
				contention that the PMC Agreement stood repudiated by the Respondents,
				<lb />
				and in case, if the Respondent was to dispute the repudiation, the
				<lb />
				Petitioner terminated the PMC agreement on the occurrence of the
				<lb />
				circumstances as specified in clause 2.8.1 (g) of the PMC Agreement,
				<lb />
				namely on the ground that the DRP was not being implemented and/or
				<lb />
				was stopped and abandoned. The respondent over and above this
				<lb />
				accepted the retention amount.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				56.
				<lb />
				This being the evidentiary position on record of the arbitral
				<lb />
				tribunal, as what what has been held in the impugned award in this
				<lb />
				context is required to be noted. In paragraph 24 of the impugned Award
				<lb />
				the arbitral tribunal records as under :-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				24: &quot; It is the contention of the respondents that since the claimant
				<lb />
				has repudiated the contract by recovering the retention money in
				<lb />
				contravention of the terms of clause 6, of the said agreement, the
				<lb />
				respondent is entitled to terminate the said agreement. In our
				<lb />
				view, this contention cannot be accepted. The earlier arbitral
				<lb />
				tribunal passed an order for release of the retention money
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				although the claimant had not made any claim in that regard in the
				<lb />
				arbitration proceedings. For this reason the High Court has set
				<lb />
				aside this part of the award. If in the meantime ie; before the
				<lb />
				award in this respect was set aside, in view of the award, if the
				<lb />
				claimant has sought to realise the amount awarded, this cannot be
				<lb />
				treated as a repudiation of the contract. The demand has been
				<lb />
				made in view of the award and not because the claimant wants you
				<lb />
				reported the contract or go against the contract&quot;
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				57.
				<lb />
				The above observation of the Arbitral Tribunal in my opinion,
				<lb />
				completely overlooks the clear evidence on record. This for two-fold
				<lb />
				reasons. Firstly, the Respondents not only by its letter dated 25 June 2012
				<lb />
				which was addressed to the Petitioner, immediately after the Arbitral
				<lb />
				Tribunal rendered the first Award, demanded the retention amount which
				<lb />
				was admittedly payable after the completion of the contract but also
				<lb />
				maintained the said demand even in the Respondent&apos;s reply dated 23
				<lb />
				August 2012 to the termination notice. The Respondent hence justified the
				<lb />
				said demand inter alia recording that the Respondents confirmed and
				<lb />
				reiterated the invoices sent to the Petitioner along with letter dated 25
				<lb />
				June 2012 which in my opinion would certainly amount to repudiation.
				<lb />
				Only a person who foresees that the contract is not on foot and that
				<lb />
				nothing further would be required to be done by him, would like to jump
				<lb />
				the contractual conditions to seek a benefit what it would be entitled at
				<lb />
				the end of the contract. This is what has exactly happened with the
				<lb />
				respondents by demanding the retention amount which would have been
				<lb />
				entitled only at the end of the contract.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				58.
				<lb />
				Secondly this is not the only reason, the fact of repudiation as
				<lb />
				pointed out by Mr. Khambatta was also clear from the position the
				<lb />
				respondent took before this Court, which in no case could have been
				<lb />
				overlooked by the arbitral tribunal. Before this Court in the proceedings of
				<lb />
				the Arbitration Petition (Arbitration Petition No.1130 of 2012 ) the
				<lb />
				Respondent asserted that the contract is at a stand-still, that the tender
				<lb />
				activities were abandoned by the Petitioner and MHADA was appointed as
				<lb />
				a developer for the project. Such assertion of the Respondent was logical
				<lb />
				to the Respondent demanding the retention amount. This admitted factual
				<lb />
				position as emerged from the record was necessarily required to be
				<lb />
				considered by the Arbitral Tribunal in rendering a finding, on the issue of
				<lb />
				repudiation as forcefully urged by Mr. Khambatta learned senior counsel
				<lb />
				for the Petitioner. Thus the aforesaid finding as recorded by the arbitral
				<lb />
				tribunal is without application of mind to the clear evidence on record
				<lb />
				and/or a finding contrary to the record has been arrived at by the arbitral
				<lb />
				tribunal, in holding that there is no repudiation of the contract at the
				<lb />
				hands of the respondent. The petitioner in my opinion would be correct in
				<lb />
				asserting a perversity on this count.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				59.
				<lb />
				Further, the Respondent was aware of the contractual position
				<lb />
				in which the parties stood and more particularly, as to what was the
				<lb />
				agreed in clause 6.4 of the PMC agreement namely that the retention
				<lb />
				money was to be released in two installments which was firstly 50% of the
				<lb />
				completion certificate being received and 50% to be released after three
				<lb />
				years from the date of the completion certificate. When the Respondents
				<lb />
				demanded the payments which were surely due to it, only on the
				<lb />
				completion of the contract, this certainly brought about a legal
				<lb />
				consequence of the Respondents accepting that the contract is not
				<lb />
				required to be performed any further which would be nothing but a
				<lb />
				position of repudiation of the contract.
				<lb />
				There can be no other
				<lb />
				consequence one can prudently gather. In my opinion, when the arbitral
				<lb />
				award in the first arbitration, granted retention amount to the respondents
				<lb />
				(although not prayed for) and in pursuance thereto, a demand being
				<lb />
				raised by the respondent for the said amount, a legal consequence was
				<lb />
				brought about and which would flow from such demand qua the contract,
				<lb />
				namely the respondent accepting that the contract is not to be performed
				<lb />
				any further, that is repudiating the contract. Any other meaning to be
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				91
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				attributed to such a conduct of the respondent would amount to observing
				<lb />
				something contrary to clause 6.4 or putting the parties in a position
				<lb />
				contrary to the said contractual condition. The arbitral tribunal could not
				<lb />
				have discarded this overwhelming evidence on record to record by
				<lb />
				assigning an unacceptable and cryptic reasoning as set out in the
				<lb />
				impugned award namely that as Respondent had demanded the retention
				<lb />
				money, in pursuance of the Award it would not amount to repudiation.
				<lb />
				This reasoning for the above reasons on the face of the record amounts to
				<lb />
				a perversity.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				60.
				<lb />
				In this context a useful reference can be made to the
				<lb />
				observations of Jackson, J. in P. Narasimha Mudali and others versus Potti
				<lb />
				Narayansami Chetty and others 16 as to what is the consequence if a party
				<lb />
				to a contract repudiates the contract and the principle of waiver and
				<lb />
				estoppel, which is synonymous and akin to acquiescence . The following
				<lb />
				observations on the principle of law in my opinion are squarely applicable
				<lb />
				in the present facts:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;3.
				<lb />
				The point taken in this appeal is that the contract was
				<lb />
				never cancelled and the appellants rely for this position upon Frost
				<lb />
				v. Knight 26 L.T. 77 : 20 W.R. 471, where there it is laid down at
				<lb />
				page 122, that if one party to a contract repudiates it, the promisee
				<lb />
				may treat the repudiation as inoperative, and at the end of the
				<lb />
				period of the contract, treat the other party as responsible for all
				<lb />
				the consequences of non-performance, thereby, keeping the
				<lb />
				contract alive, or, on the other hand, he may treat the repudiation
				<lb />
				as a wrongful putting an end to the contract, and may at once
				<lb />
				bring his action as on a breach of it. The Chetty firm evidently
				<lb />
				adopted the latter alternative when it brought Original Suit No.27
				<lb />
				of 1919. But relying upon a passage in the plaint of that suit, the
				<lb />
				appellants would have it that the Chettys availed themselves of
				<lb />
				both alternatives. They sued upon the breach of the contract, and
				<lb />
				in the same breath kept it open, because, in paragraph 11 of their
				<lb />
				plaint there is a statement that they were still entitled to deliver
				<lb />
				the rest of the bales. The short answer to this is that they had no
				<lb />
				right to make any such reservation. Frost v. Knight L.R.,7 Ex.3 is
				<lb />
				recognised authority prescribing the remedies open to a promisee
				<lb />
				and he cannot both sue upon the breach and also keep the contract
				<lb />
				open.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				4.
				<lb />
				The appellants then proceed to argue that, if so much must
				<lb />
				be conceded, the Chetty firm closed the first portion of the
				<lb />
				contract, but re-opened a new contract by their 11 th paragraph.
				<lb />
				This plea can have no force unless the Mudaly firm can show its
				<lb />
				acceptance of this fresh tender, and so far from accepting it, that
				<lb />
				firm in its written statement utterly repudiated the 11 th paragraph,
				<lb />
				as false (Ex. III, paragraph II). Therefore, there was no fresh
				<lb />
				contract between the parties.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				5.
				<lb />
				Apart from contesting this plea of the plaintiffs, the
				<lb />
				respondents have a good case as set forth in paragraph 8 of their
				<lb />
				written statement by way of waiver and estoppel. A party cannot
				<lb />
				repudiate a contract, wait a year, and then suddenly insist upon its
				<lb />
				performance. The question turns upon whether his conduct gives
				<lb />
				rise to an implication of abandonment of Pearl Mill Co. v. Ivry
				<lb />
				Tannery Co. (919), I.K.B. 78 at p.83. Delay coupled with
				<lb />
				repudiation does give rise to such an implication.
				<lb />
				&quot;Where one party by acts and conduct evinces an intention
				<lb />
				no longer to be bound by the contract, the other party will be
				<lb />
				justified in regarding himself to be emancipated: &quot;Halsbury&apos;s Laws
				<lb />
				of England, Vol.VII para.865.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				61.
				<lb />
				Mr.Jagtiani, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent has
				<lb />
				supported the findings of the arbitral tribunal as rendered in paragraphs
				<lb />
				22 to 26 on repudiation to submit that there could not be any repudiation
				<lb />
				in the respondents demanding retention fee as granted to the respondents
				<lb />
				in the first arbitration. It is his submission that this would never constitute
				<lb />
				repudiation as observed by the arbitral tribunal. Mr.Jagtiani in support of
				<lb />
				his submission that there is no repudiation in the facts of the present case,
				<lb />
				has relied on the decisions as noted above which are being discussed
				<lb />
				hereafter.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				62.
				<lb />
				In Freeth and Anr Vs. Burr 17 the court was dealing with a
				<lb />
				dispute concerning a contract between the parties to sell to the plaintiff
				<lb />
				250 tonns pig-iron at 56s per ton, half to be delivered in two weeks,
				<lb />
				remainder in four weeks and payment was to be made in cash 14 days
				<lb />
				after delivery of each parcel. The delivery of first 125 tonns was not
				<lb />
				completed for merely six months. The plaintiff refused to pay for the first
				<lb />
				parcel, claiming right to set off the loss, they had sustained for being
				<lb />
				obliged to procure other iron consequent of the defendant&apos;s default, but
				<lb />
				they still urged the delivery of the second parcel. The defendants treating
				<lb />
				their refusal to pay as a breach and abandonment of the contract by the
				<lb />
				plaintiff, declined to deliver any more. There was no suggestion of
				<lb />
				inability on the part of the plaintiff to pay and the price of the first parcel
				<lb />
				was ultimately paid. It is in this context the court held that mere refusal to
				<lb />
				pay for the first parcel, need not under the circumstances, warrant the
				<lb />
				defendant in treating the contract as abandoned, and refusing to deliver
				<lb />
				the remainder the plaintiff was entitled to damages for the breach. The
				<lb />
				facts are in complete variance to the facts in hand. In the present case
				<lb />
				there was a complete intention on the part of the Respondent to hold out
				<lb />
				that further obligations under the contract need not be performed and on
				<lb />
				this assumption the Respondent hit the dead-end of the contractual path
				<lb />
				by demanding the retention money. The respondent was clear that the
				<lb />
				contract would not be performed when the respondent demanded
				<lb />
				payment of the retention money. Subsequent to this clear representation
				<lb />
				as made by the respondent, the petitioner terminated the contract also
				<lb />
				referring to the repudiation of the same by the respondent. Thus a clear
				<lb />
				position was taken by the respondents of the contract being not on foot.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				63.
				<lb />
				In Sweet V. Maxwell 18 there was a dispute between the
				<lb />
				landlord and tenant under an assignment of lease. The Court held that
				<lb />
				there was no repudiation. In my opinion, the decision is not surely
				<lb />
				applicable in the facts of the present case.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				64.
				<lb />
				Woodar V. Wimpey 19 was a case before the House of Lords
				<lb />
				arising out of a contract to buy certain land. The Wanders were sent a
				<lb />
				notice purporting to rescind a contract invoking condition E(a)(iii) on the
				<lb />
				ground that the Secretary of State for Environment had commenced the
				<lb />
				procedure for compulsory acquisition of the part of land. The Wanders
				<lb />
				brought an action against the purchaser for declaration that the condition
				<lb />
				gave them no right to rescind the contract. In defence the purchaser
				<lb />
				contended that on a true construction of the contract condition, the
				<lb />
				notice of recission was valid. The trial court held that the purchaser was
				<lb />
				not entitled to invoke the condition and by doing so they have wrongfully
				<lb />
				repudiated the contract and they were accordingly liable for damages. The
				<lb />
				Court of appeal had affirmed this decision, however varying the amount of
				<lb />
				damages. While allowing the appeal the House of Lords held that in the
				<lb />
				facts of the case a party who took action relying on the terms of contract
				<lb />
				in question and not manifesting by his conduct an ulterior intention to
				<lb />
				abandon, it was not to be treated as repudiating it. The whole
				<lb />
				circumstances must be looked at. It is in this context the House of Lords
				<lb />
				discussed the decisions on repudiation of a contract, observing that the
				<lb />
				real matter for consideration was whether an act or conduct of one to do
				<lb />
				or do not amounts to an intention to abandon and altogether refuse
				<lb />
				performance of the contract. In referring to the decision in Heyman Vs.
				<lb />
				Darwins Ltd. (1942) A.C. 56, Lord Write has been quoted to observe as
				<lb />
				under:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;........ But perhaps the commonest application of the word
				<lb />
				&quot;repudiation&quot; is to what is often called the anticipatory breach of a
				<lb />
				contract where a party by word or conduct evinces an intention no
				<lb />
				longer to be bound and the other party accepts the repudiation
				<lb />
				and rescinds the contract. In such case if the repudiation is
				<lb />
				wrongful and the rescission is rightful, the contract is ended by the
				<lb />
				rescission but only as far as concerns future performance. It
				<lb />
				remains alive for the award of damages for the breach it
				<lb />
				constitutes the repudiation.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				65.
				<lb />
				In the present case as noted above the respondent by its
				<lb />
				eminent conduct evinced a clear intention that it is no longer required to
				<lb />
				perform its obligation under the contract and accordingly demanded the
				<lb />
				retention money contrary to the terms of the contract. The petitioner also
				<lb />
				recognized this and paid the retention amount which was accepted by the
				<lb />
				respondent. Thus, the principle echoed by this decision, in fact would
				<lb />
				assist the petitioner.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(ii) As to whether the termination of the PMC agreement by the petitioner
				<lb />
				was legal and valid ?
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				66.
				<lb />
				At the outset it needs to be observed that the Arbitral Tribunal
				<lb />
				primarily on the advertisement dated 30 January 2016 issued by the
				<lb />
				petitioner, inviting tenders by way of international bidding, which was
				<lb />
				issued after about 4 years of the termination of the PMC Agreement, has
				<lb />
				held that the
				<lb />
				project (DRP) was an ongoing project, hence the
				<lb />
				termination of the PMC agreement by the Petitioner invoking clause
				<lb />
				2.8.1(g) of the PMC agreement was illegal. As noted above the
				<lb />
				termination of the PMC agreement by the Petitioner was by invoking
				<lb />
				clause 2.8.1(g) under which the parties agreed that the Petitioner could
				<lb />
				terminate the agreement for the reason that the DRP was not being
				<lb />
				implemented and/or stopped and abandoned by the State Government
				<lb />
				due to any change in law or litigation or for any reason whatsoever.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				67.
				<lb />
				On this count the reasoning as set out by the Arbitral Tribunal
				<lb />
				in paragraphs 28, 29, 30 and 35 of the impugned award is required to be
				<lb />
				seen, which reads thus:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				28.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				According to the Respondent this means that the DRP for
				<lb />
				which PMC was engaged was stopped or abandoned. This
				<lb />
				contention must be rejected. Clause 2.8.1(g) deals with a
				<lb />
				situation where the DRP is not implemented, and/or &apos;stopped and
				<lb />
				abandoned&apos;. The word &quot;stopped&quot; has to be read in conjunction
				<lb />
				with &quot;abandoned&quot;. It refers to permanent stoppage and not a
				<lb />
				temporary halt. All the situations described in clause 2.8.1(g) are
				<lb />
				situations where the project comes to an end. It is also necessary
				<lb />
				to bear in mind the nature of the present project. It was a mega
				<lb />
				project to rehabilitate a population of 2-3 lakhs plus build
				<lb />
				additional housing which cuold be sold in the market to recover
				<lb />
				the cost of this massive rehabilitation and earn profit for the
				<lb />
				developer. The project was expected to span several years. The
				<lb />
				contract does not provide any time frame for completion of the
				<lb />
				project. It also allows for alterations in the DRP. A mere delay,
				<lb />
				and that too on the part of the Respondent, can not be considered
				<lb />
				as permanent stoppage or abandonment of the entire project.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				29.
				<lb />
				The Respondent has nowhere stated that it does not
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				98
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				propose to redevelop Dharavi or that it does not propose to invite
				<lb />
				tenders for DRP. In fact during the pendency of the arbitration
				<lb />
				proceedings before this Tribunal, the Respondent issued a notice
				<lb />
				inviting tenders for DRP which notice is dated 30 th January 2016.
				<lb />
				And this necessitated evidence being led by the Respondent in
				<lb />
				support of pleas which were raised by way of amendment. The
				<lb />
				Claimant has been appointed as management consultant for the
				<lb />
				project. No material has been put before us by the Respondent to
				<lb />
				show that the project has been abandoned or is permanently
				<lb />
				stopped.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				30.
				<lb />
				The said sub-clause does not deal with a situation
				<lb />
				where the State for its own reasons has delayed the project or
				<lb />
				wants to vary the project. There is no prohibition in the
				<lb />
				agreement against changes being made in the project. In fact, the
				<lb />
				notice inviting tenders during the pendency of these proceedings
				<lb />
				goes to show that the project is alive and the State Government
				<lb />
				proposes to go ahead with the project. Clause 2.8.1(g) is therefore
				<lb />
				not attracted. The termination of the contract is not valid in law.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				35.
				<lb />
				In the present case, the Respondent has taken a
				<lb />
				view that the long delay in commencing post-tender activities and/
				<lb />
				or changes which the Respondent wished to make in the DRP
				<lb />
				amounted to abandonment of the project by the Respondent or its
				<lb />
				stoppage. The view was not justified in law. But it cannot be
				<lb />
				viewed as mala-fide termination or termination for an ulterior
				<lb />
				motive on the part of the Respondent. In fact the Claimant has
				<lb />
				throughout insisted on malafides against him on the part of named
				<lb />
				persons. It was only at the stage of submissions that the Claimant
				<lb />
				raised a plea of mala fides in law. In our view the material before
				<lb />
				us is not adequate to arrive at the conclusion of mala fides in law
				<lb />
				on the part of the Respondent in terminating the contract. The
				<lb />
				termination, however, by the Respondent&apos;s letter of 4 th August
				<lb />
				2012 is wrongful as stated herein before.
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				68.
				<lb />
				Mr.Jagtiani, learned Senior Counsel for the respondents has
				<lb />
				supported the above reasons to submit that the tribunal has rightly
				<lb />
				interpreted the termination clause to mean a permanent stoppage or non
				<lb />
				implementation of the project and not a mere temporary break in the
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				99
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				project which is a reasonable and probable interpretation. It is his
				<lb />
				submission that even in the letter dated 4 August 2012 the petitioner itself
				<lb />
				has stated that the project has presently being stopped and is not being
				<lb />
				implemented. He submits that, also there was sufficient evidence before
				<lb />
				the tribunal to demonstrate that the project was alive and kicking. He
				<lb />
				submits that the project was alive, was also clear from the advertisement
				<lb />
				dated 30 January 2016 issued by the respondents which was at the fag
				<lb />
				end of the arbitral proceedings which clearly went to show that the project
				<lb />
				was not permanently stopped or not being implemented and/or
				<lb />
				abandoned.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				69.
				<lb />
				Having perused the record, I am not persuaded to accept the
				<lb />
				submissions of Mr.Jagtiani. This more particularly considering the
				<lb />
				overwhelming evidence which, in my opinion, was completely discarded
				<lb />
				by the arbitral tribunal. The reasons in that regard are being discussed
				<lb />
				hereafter.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>

				<lb />
				The petitioner terminated PMC Agreement vide termination
				<lb />
				letter dated 4 th August 2012, invoking Clause 2.8.1(g) of the PMC
				<lb />
				agreement. It is clearly seen from the record that there were number of
				<lb />
				reasons and sufficiently to the knowledge of the Respondent that the DRP
				<lb />
				in the nature it was conceived, relevant to the PMC Agreement, was not
				<lb />
				being implemented and/or stopped nay abandoned. Mr. Khambata has
				<lb />
				taken me through the the several clauses of the PMC agreement which are
				<lb />
				relevant to the issue of termination. Mr. Khambata has contended that it
				<lb />
				was an admitted position on record that the petitioner despite all efforts
				<lb />
				could not award the contract to any bidder. This was to the knowledge of
				<lb />
				the Respondent at all material times. He submitted that thus a clear
				<lb />
				situation was brought about that the contract could not be awarded to any
				<lb />
				of the bidders and hence there was no question of the DRP moving
				<lb />
				forward for any post-tender activities much less for construction to be
				<lb />
				undertaken. Mr.Khambata also has submitted that for the many
				<lb />
				intervening years the respondent had accepted this position as also
				<lb />
				invoked the first arbitration unsuccessfully demanding idling charges,
				<lb />
				further litigating as if the contract had fallen to the ground.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				71.
				<lb />
				When no bidder could be awarded the contract in the year
				<lb />
				2008 or even for that matter going by the Respondents own case no bids
				<lb />
				were received even in 2016, was something which was not in control of
				<lb />
				the Petitioner as rightly contended by Mr.Khambata.
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				72.
				<lb />
				The circumstances which were brought about not only in the
				<lb />
				year 2007 but also in the year 2016 that no bids being received were
				<lb />
				significant circumstances relevant to the clear wordings of the termination
				<lb />
				clause as agreed between the parties. It was necessary for the tribunal to
				<lb />
				attribute meaning to all the words of such a widely worded termination
				<lb />
				clause. Certainly, the circumstances which prevailed for about five years
				<lb />
				cannot be said to be of any temporary character which would keep the
				<lb />
				contract alive and capable of being performed at a future date. In fact, it
				<lb />
				can be observed that the circumstances were so sweeping and
				<lb />
				fundamental that even the respondent acknowledged the circumstances,
				<lb />
				to be as good as that the contract being dead. This is clearly established on
				<lb />
				the facts as explicitly staring from the evidence, which has been
				<lb />
				completely ignored and overlooked by the Arbitral Tribunal. These
				<lb />
				circumstances obviously led to a consequence of the petitioner rightly
				<lb />
				invoking termination clause as contained in Clause 2.8.1(g) inevitably
				<lb />
				terminating the contract. Surely, the circumstances were not such which
				<lb />
				can be classified to be an action on the part of the petitioner to have
				<lb />
				breached the contract. This apart, as noted above, the respondent itself
				<lb />
				undoubtedly had repudiated the contract by demanding the retention
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				102
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				amount. Thus, there was a clear situation of impossibility of performance
				<lb />
				of the contract and not a deliberate or intentional failure or refusal on the
				<lb />
				part of the petitioner to perform its obligations. The evidence on record
				<lb />
				clearly indicated that the contract had ceased to remain on foot.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				73.
				<lb />
				Hence there is much substance in the contention as urged on
				<lb />
				behalf of the petitioner that the impugned award is totally oblivious of not
				<lb />
				only the contractual provisions but also the clear evidentiary position on
				<lb />
				record. Considering the peculiarity of contract and anticipating that there
				<lb />
				was no likelihood on the part of the petitioner and /or the parties to fulfill
				<lb />
				their receptive obligations under the PMC Agreement in the given
				<lb />
				situation that despite efforts no bids could be received and fianlised being
				<lb />
				a situation beyond the control of any of the parties it could not have been
				<lb />
				said that there was a breach of Agreement.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				74.
				<lb />
				Moreover what was writ large was that the respondent being
				<lb />
				well aware of the fact that the DRP was not being implemented and/or
				<lb />
				was stopped, was also quite clear from its own assertion before this Court
				<lb />
				in the proceedings of Arbitration Petition No.1130 of 2012 as noted in the
				<lb />
				order passed by this Court on the said petition, as extracted above, when
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				the Respondent as a matter of record asserted firstly that the project has
				<lb />
				been suspended by the petitioner over which the Respondent had no
				<lb />
				control; secondly that the project was modified by the Government and
				<lb />
				the Respondent had no say over the modifications; and thirdly that the
				<lb />
				tender activities were abandoned by the Petitioner and MHADA was
				<lb />
				appointed as a Developer for the project.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				75.
				<lb />
				This apart, also from the correspondence between the parties
				<lb />
				as entered prior to the termination of the PMC agreement it was a clear
				<lb />
				position on record that the DRP relevant to the PMC Agreement was not
				<lb />
				being implemented. The record was replete with evidence indicating that
				<lb />
				the Petitioner was intending to undertake development of Dharavi by
				<lb />
				adopting new methodology namely of having a development as per the
				<lb />
				provisions of Development Control Regulations No.33(9)(A) and 33(10)
				<lb />
				(A) and for which the State Government at the highest level had accorded
				<lb />
				approval. This was for some of the sectors. The respondent in no manner
				<lb />
				was involved in the pre-tender activities or had any role in such
				<lb />
				development as proposed. There was no material on record to relate the
				<lb />
				respondent to these steps being taken by the petitioner under the
				<lb />
				advertisement dated 30 January 2016. Thus as rightly urged on behalf of
				<lb />
				the petitioner this evidentiary position was sufficient to indicate that the
				<lb />
				DRP for which the Respondent was appointed was stopped or abandoned
				<lb />
				as also urged by the petitioner before the arbitral tribunal.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				76.
				<lb />
				It was hence a clear position on record as urged on behalf of
				<lb />
				the Petitioner, that what was envisaged under Government Resolution
				<lb />
				dated 4 th February 2004 and the consequent exercise undertaken by the
				<lb />
				petitioner of inviting EOI on 31 st May 2007, having failed to materialize,
				<lb />
				despite serious efforts taken for almost four years, ultimately a decision
				<lb />
				was taken on 16 th May 2011 to cancel the bidding process and a further
				<lb />
				decision was taken on 21 st May 2011 to undertake re-development of
				<lb />
				some of the sectors as clear from the petitioner&apos;s communications dated
				<lb />
				28 th November 2011 and 15 th June 2012 whereby the petitioner had
				<lb />
				submitted an alternative proposal to the State Government for
				<lb />
				redevelopment of some of the Sectors (Sector 3 and Sectors 1 to 4
				<lb />
				respectively) on the model of cluster development. It is also quite clear
				<lb />
				that the Respondent was aware of all these developments. If this was to be
				<lb />
				the evidence on the record of the arbitral tribunal, it could not have been
				<lb />
				held by the arbitral tribunal that the action of the petitioner in invoking
				<lb />
				Clause 2.8.1 (g) to terminate the contract was illegal. It is a settled
				<lb />
				105
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				principle of law that every clause in a contract would be required to be
				<lb />
				attributed its due meaning so as to gather the intention of the parties in
				<lb />
				providing such clause. A contractual clause cannot be rendered
				<lb />
				meaningless more particularly when there were overwhelming
				<lb />
				circumstances fitting into the termination clause, echoing that the contract
				<lb />
				had come to a standstill or was not being implemented or stopped.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				77.
				<lb />
				In my opinion, the petitioner would thus be correct in its
				<lb />
				contention that the Respondent was sufficiently aware and had acquiesced
				<lb />
				to the position that DRP relevant to PMC Agreement was abandoned by
				<lb />
				the petitioner and that the parties would not be required to perform their
				<lb />
				obligations under the Contract. This was also clear from Respondent&apos;s
				<lb />
				reply to the termination notice viz. respondent&apos;s letter dated 23 rd August
				<lb />
				2012. What the Respondent did was not only to make unsubstantiated
				<lb />
				allegations against the Officers of the Petitioner, which were subsequently
				<lb />
				not pressed and/or withdrawn by the respondent in the Arbitration
				<lb />
				proceedings. However following statements in regard to the conduct of
				<lb />
				the respondent showing its acquiescence to the DRP in its original form
				<lb />
				being not proceeded, are required to be noted as contained in the said
				<lb />
				letter which reads thus:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;10. Our client and Mr.Mehta genuinely though that the loss of
				<lb />
				years (years taken for executing the PMC Agreement -4.5 years )
				<lb />
				would not continue and you would take your responsibilities
				<lb />
				seriously and you would perform the PMC Agreement effectively.
				<lb />
				However, the then OSD-DRP (Mr.Chatterjee) in order to wreak
				<lb />
				vengeance against Mr. Mehta decided to sabotage the DRP.
				<lb />
				Mr.Chatterjee was given the project on the platter which he has
				<lb />
				tried his utmost to destroy on the pretext of having better options.
				<lb />
				After 4 years he is unable to come up with any better alternative
				<lb />
				plan. The OSD-DRP (Mr.Chatterjee) who had assumed the office
				<lb />
				in or around July 2008 worked incessantly since to get the DRP
				<lb />
				scrapped. Initially the then OSD-DRP (Mr.Chatterjee) decided to
				<lb />
				relook the entire project even though the same was approved and
				<lb />
				re-approved by the GoM. On or around 23 rd June 2009, the CoS
				<lb />
				approved the Standardized Master Plan (&quot;SMP&quot;) and advised to
				<lb />
				issue financial bids by 20 th July 2009. .............&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				12.
				<lb />
				...................... &quot;Now our client has been informed in the
				<lb />
				letter under reply that you purportedly on 28 th November 2011
				<lb />
				and 15 th June 2012 submitted the allegedly alternative proposals
				<lb />
				to the GoM for development of rest of the Sectors. Our client
				<lb />
				states that the strategy and design including the concept of
				<lb />
				development of Dharavi was of Mr.Mehta, and any so called
				<lb />
				alternate plans are nothing more than a mere camouflage of
				<lb />
				Mr.Mehta&apos;s original plans. Any such attempt on your part will not
				<lb />
				and can not take away the credit from our client and Mr.Mehta.
				<lb />
				You are estopped in light of your conduct from in anyway using
				<lb />
				the concept and design of our client (Mr.Mehta)for the
				<lb />
				development of Dharavi without proper authorization from our
				<lb />
				client and Mr. Mehta. Needless to say that if any attempt is made
				<lb />
				to use the plans created by our client (Mr.Mehta) for the DRP
				<lb />
				without adequate compensation to our client (Mr.Mehta) then you
				<lb />
				the former and present OSD-DRP (Mr.Gavai and Mr. Biswas) and
				<lb />
				the present Principal Secretary Housing will be personally liable
				<lb />
				for any loss that may be caused to our client (Mr.Mehta) and will
				<lb />
				also be guilty of plagiarizing Mr. Mehta&apos;s concept, design and plan
				<lb />
				for DRP.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				78.
				<lb />
				The above facts would clearly show that, a situation
				<lb />
				sufficiently to be recognised in law was created, in regard to the
				<lb />
				respondent accepting that the PMC Agreement would not be performed.
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				107
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				Moreover this conduct on the part of the respondent was admittedly,
				<lb />
				congruent and consistent to its earlier conduct namely the respondent
				<lb />
				claiming retention amount as granted to it, by the arbitral award passed
				<lb />
				in the first Arbitration.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				79.
				<lb />
				From the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal as contained in the above
				<lb />
				quoted paragraphs of the impugned award, it is instantly seen that each
				<lb />
				one of them are on an erroneous assumption contrary to the evidence on
				<lb />
				record. They are also wholly against the plain meaning which can be
				<lb />
				attributed to the termination clause (clause 2.8.1(g)) as invoked by the
				<lb />
				petitioner to terminate the contract in the circumstances as borne out by
				<lb />
				the evidence on record. The termination clause in my opinion was quite
				<lb />
				plain, simple and of a nature very unlikely to create any confusion or
				<lb />
				ambiguity in its following words:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;2.1.8(g) : If the Dharavi Redevelopment Project for
				<lb />
				which the PMC is engaged is not implemented and/or
				<lb />
				stopped and abandoned by the State Government due to
				<lb />
				any change in law or litigation or for any reason
				<lb />
				whatsoever.&quot;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				80.
				<lb />
				It needs to be observed and as rightly asserted by the
				<lb />
				Petitioner before the arbitral tribunal that there was a clear change in the
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				108
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				circumstances, for the Petitioner to issue the advertisement on 30 January
				<lb />
				2016. This was done by the petitioner in the public interest, almost four
				<lb />
				years after the termination of the PMC agreement. There was no bar for
				<lb />
				the Petitioner to do so. This would have also not affected in any manner
				<lb />
				the prior act of the petitioner, terminating the PMC agreement. It is
				<lb />
				extremely surprising, as to how the Arbitral Tribunal could record that
				<lb />
				there was no material placed before the arbitral tribunal to show that the
				<lb />
				project has been abandoned or permanently stopped. Such observation
				<lb />
				being made primarily on the basis of advertisement dated 30 th January
				<lb />
				2016, would certainly amount to the arbitral tribunal turning a blind eye
				<lb />
				to the ample and overflowing evidence on record, of the project as
				<lb />
				relevant to the PMC agreement being stopped. It would also amount to
				<lb />
				the arbitral tribunal recording a finding contrary to the evidence on
				<lb />
				record.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				81.
				<lb />
				In any event the arbitral tribunal could not have overlooked
				<lb />
				the material contents of the termination clause which also provided for
				<lb />
				&apos;any other reason&apos; as one of the contents of clause 2.8.1(g) which should
				<lb />
				have been interpreted as a prudent body would interpret, namely on the
				<lb />
				first principles, as to how a contractual clause would be understood by
				<lb />
				the parties in a commercial sense. What is gravely missed by the arbitral
				<lb />
				tribunal and in respect of which abundant material/evidence was placed
				<lb />
				on record of the arbitral proceeding was that the advertisement dated 30 th
				<lb />
				January 2016 was not issued in context of the development of Dharavi as
				<lb />
				envisaged and relevant to the Government Resolution dated 4 th February
				<lb />
				2004 and consequent agreement entered with respondent namely PMC
				<lb />
				Agreement dated 1 st November 2008. It was also not the case of the
				<lb />
				Respondent that the nature and the scope of the published advertisement
				<lb />
				issued in the year 2007 namely E.O.I. and fresh advertisement/tenders
				<lb />
				issued on 30 th January 2016 were identical. There was no pre-tender
				<lb />
				activity undertaken from the Respondent qua this advertisement. These
				<lb />
				plentiful and material considerations which were over-pouring from the
				<lb />
				evidence on record are completely bypassed and /or not looked at by the
				<lb />
				arbitral tribunal. It was thus, ex-facie perverse for the Arbitral Tribunal to
				<lb />
				record a finding of the DRP of 2007 to be alive. The petitioner would be
				<lb />
				correct in its contention that the Arbitral Tribunal has completely
				<lb />
				discarded, over-looked and/or has failed to consider the material evidence
				<lb />
				on record in this regard. The contention of the respondent as accepted by
				<lb />
				the arbitral tribunal also leads to a patent absurdity in as much as it would
				<lb />
				bring about a consequence that the respondent would forever and/or in
				<lb />
				perpetuity, for any kind of DRP to be undertaken by the petitioner would
				<lb />
				continue to be the PMC. Surely this was neither the intention of the
				<lb />
				parties as gathered from the PMC agreement. Hence, the findings of the
				<lb />
				Arbitral Tribunal to conclude that DRP was alive, is contrary to the
				<lb />
				evidence on record.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				82.
				<lb />
				As noted above the arbitral tribunal has rendered a finding on
				<lb />
				termination to be invalid, contrary to multitude of evidence on record.
				<lb />
				The respondent had in fact acquiesced in the DRP as conceived for the
				<lb />
				PMC agreement, having stopped and or abandoned. The findings of the
				<lb />
				arbitral tribunal on this count are thus recorded wholly without
				<lb />
				application of mind to these glaring aspects as depicted by the evidence on
				<lb />
				record, amounting to an apparent perversity. Although it would be in the
				<lb />
				domain of the arbitral tribunal to interpret the contractual clauses and
				<lb />
				appreciate the evidence, it has to be a reasonable and prudent
				<lb />
				interpretation and appreciation of evidence and not something which is
				<lb />
				impossible to be conceived by any reasonable standards leading to an
				<lb />
				absurdity. What the arbitral tribunal has done is to have a selective and a
				<lb />
				non-holistic approach in consideration of the evidence on record in
				<lb />
				determining on the legality of the termination. The non-consideration of
				<lb />
				the substantive material has resulted in the arbitral tribunal trading on the
				<lb />
				path of conjectures, arbitrariness and absurdity.
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				83.
				<lb />
				I am not persuaded to accept Mr Jagtani&apos;s contention that the
				<lb />
				tribunal would be correct in its observation in interpreting clause 2.8.1 (g)
				<lb />
				to mean that it can only be a permanent stoppage or non-implementation
				<lb />
				of the project, and a mere temporary break in the project would not
				<lb />
				suffice and justify the petitioner invoking the said clause to terminate the
				<lb />
				contract. It is also his submission that this is a reasonable and possible
				<lb />
				interpretation of the contractual clause by the arbitral tribunal. I do not
				<lb />
				agree. As rightly contended by Mr.Khambatta the arbitral tribunal reading
				<lb />
				a temporary stoppage (when it is not), the arbitral tribunal has read
				<lb />
				something into the termination clause which is not provided for by the
				<lb />
				parties. In my opinion the arbitral tribunal has attributed an impossible
				<lb />
				meaning to the said termination clause, it is surely not a possible
				<lb />
				interpretation. Moreover such interpretation does violence to the plain
				<lb />
				reading of the termination clause leading to an absurdity. In my opinion
				<lb />
				the arbitral tribunal has made an interpretation which would wholly
				<lb />
				change the meaning of the termination clause as to what the parties had
				<lb />
				agreed and in fact supplants and/or has re-written the contractual clause.
				<lb />
				It is certainly a perverse interpretation of the termination clause by the
				<lb />
				arbitral tribunal.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				84.
				<lb />
				It is well settled that if an interpretation of the contract by an
				<lb />
				arbitral tribunal is not a possible interpretation, the arbitral award on the
				<lb />
				foundation of such perverse interpretation would be held to be patently
				<lb />
				illegal. In a recent judgment of the Supreme Court in South East Asia and
				<lb />
				Marine Engineering and Constructions Limited (SEAMEC Limited) Civil
				<lb />
				Appeal No.673 of 2012 decided on 11 th May 2020.), Justice Ramanna
				<lb />
				speaking for the Bench observed thus:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;28. In this context, the interpretation of clause 23 of the contract
				<lb />
				by the Arbitral Tribunal, to provide a wide interpretation cannot be
				<lb />
				accepted, as the thumb rule of interpretation is that the document
				<lb />
				forming a written contract should be read as a whole and so far as
				<lb />
				possible as mutually explanatory. In the case at hand, the basic
				<lb />
				rule was ignored by the tribunal while interpreting the clause.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				31.
				<lb />
				The interpretation of the Arbitral Tribunal to expand the
				<lb />
				meaning of clause 23 to include change in the rate of HSD is not
				<lb />
				possible interpretation of this contract, as the appellant did not
				<lb />
				introduce any evidence which proves the same.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				32.
				<lb />
				The other contractual terms also suggest that the
				<lb />
				interpretation of the clause, as suggested by the Arbitral Tribunal,
				<lb />
				is perverse. For instance, Item 1 of List II (Consumables) of Exhibit
				<lb />
				C (Consolidated Statement of Equipment and Services Furnished
				<lb />
				by Contractor or Operator for the Onshore Rig Operation),
				<lb />
				indicates that fuel would be supplied by the contractor, at his
				<lb />
				expense. The existence of such a clause shows that the
				<lb />
				interpretation of the contract by the Arbitral Tribunal is not a
				<lb />
				possible interpretation of the contract.&quot;
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				85.
				<lb />
				As a sequel to the above discussion it is quite clear that the
				<lb />
				Petitioner had lawfully terminated the PMC agreement, there was no
				<lb />
				scope on the record of the arbitral tribunal, for the Arbitral Tribunal to
				<lb />
				hold that the termination of the PMC agreement by the petitioner was in
				<lb />
				any manner illegal.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(iii) Whether the arbitral tribunal is correct in law and facts in
				<lb />
				awarding the damages?
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				86.
				<lb />
				Notwithstanding the above discussion that the respondent
				<lb />
				repudiated the PMC agreement and further that the termination of the
				<lb />
				agreement at the hands of the petitioner was legal, for the sake of
				<lb />
				completeness the challenge to the decision of the arbitral tribunal to
				<lb />
				award damages, is also being considered. It was argued on behalf of the
				<lb />
				petitioner that the arbitral tribunal was ex-facie not justified considering
				<lb />
				the evidence on record and the legal principles to award damages.
				<lb />
				According to the petitioners the impugned award on this count also
				<lb />
				deserves to be set aside on the ground of patent illegality.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				87.
				<lb />
				Mr.Jagtiani, learned Senior Counsel for the respondents has
				<lb />
				supported the findings of the arbitral tribunal in awarding damages. He
				<lb />
				submits that the obvious consequence of illegal termination would result
				<lb />
				into entitlement of the respondents for damages. He has submitted that
				<lb />
				originally under Clause 6 and sub-clauses thereunder as noted above, the
				<lb />
				respondent was entitled to the fees for the post tender activities as also
				<lb />
				additionally received an amount of 0.5% of the total premium received by
				<lb />
				the SRA. It is his submission that as rightly held by the tribunal in the
				<lb />
				context of the damages, it was not necessary that the premium should
				<lb />
				have been actually received by the petitioner. This for the reason that
				<lb />
				there was an illegal termination of the contract and therefore, it was
				<lb />
				logical that a reasonable estimate is required to be arrived at. It is
				<lb />
				submitted that there was sufficient evidence of the expert witnesses which
				<lb />
				established loss of profit to the respondent. It is submitted that an adverse
				<lb />
				inference was required to be drawn against the petitioner in respect of the
				<lb />
				issue in regard to the stoppage of the work, the actual cost of
				<lb />
				rehabilitation and saleable components of the project and the reasonable
				<lb />
				expected premium to be received, if the PMC agreement was allowed to
				<lb />
				run its course, as the same was within the domain, knowledge and
				<lb />
				information of the petitioner. He has submitted that in this situation the
				<lb />
				petitioner had chosen not to lead any evidence as also the cross
				<lb />
				examination by the respondent of any such witnesses was prevented. It is
				<lb />
				thus submitted that the tribunal has rightly commented on this approach
				<lb />
				of the petitioner in paragraphs 56 to 70 of the impugned award. It is
				<lb />
				submitted that the estimates of the actual cost of rehabilitation and
				<lb />
				saleable components of the project as placed on record of the arbitral
				<lb />
				tribunal by the expert witnesses was sufficient for the tribunal to award
				<lb />
				damages in the absence of any challenge to such evidence. It is further
				<lb />
				submitted that even the petitioner in the letter dated 9 March 2011 as
				<lb />
				obtained by the respondent under the Right to Information Act, being
				<lb />
				internal communication from OSD, DRP to the Secretary, Housing
				<lb />
				Department, proposing to appoint MHADA as a developer for Sector 5 of
				<lb />
				DRP, has clearly referred that the estimated premium to be received by the
				<lb />
				petitioner would be Rs.31156 crores which was about 8000 crores more
				<lb />
				than the amount estimated by the tribunal in awarding damages to the
				<lb />
				respondent. It is submitted that an adverse inference was required to be
				<lb />
				drawn even on this letter of SRA to the State Government. It is submitted
				<lb />
				that the evidence on behalf of the petitioner was no evidence to dislodge
				<lb />
				the respondent&apos;s case on damages.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				88.
				<lb />
				In my opinion, the material on record however would not
				<lb />
				persuade me to accept the above submissions of Mr.Jagtiani as being
				<lb />
				discussed in the following paragraphs.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				89.
				<lb />
				It is again required to be noted that the award of damages by
				<lb />
				the Arbitral Tribunal is, on the premise that the termination of the PMC
				<lb />
				agreement by the petitioner was unlawful. This is clear from the
				<lb />
				observations of the tribunal in discussing the issue on damages, as
				<lb />
				recorded, in para nos. 66 to 70 of the impugned award. The arbitral
				<lb />
				tribunal has observed as under :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				66.
				<lb />
				&quot;If the Respondent had stopped or abandoned the DRP as
				<lb />
				alleged by it in its notice of termination to the Claimant, why was
				<lb />
				the said advertisement published in newspapers on 30 th January
				<lb />
				2016 inviting bids for the DRP ? The witnesses examined by the
				<lb />
				Respondent are not in a position to state whether the DRP
				<lb />
				proposed under the said advertisement was similar to the DRP
				<lb />
				originally advertised which had then attracted initially a large
				<lb />
				number of bidders. If the
				<lb />
				project advertised is different in
				<lb />
				material respects from the DRP originally proposed, non-receipt of
				<lb />
				bids for the project containing different conditions cannot be
				<lb />
				looked at to establish that the original DRP was unviable or would
				<lb />
				not have attracted any bids. If the project for which bids were
				<lb />
				invited in January 2016 was similar in substantial respects to the
				<lb />
				original DRP, notice of termination is clearly bad in law,
				<lb />
				since
				<lb />
				the project has not been stopped or abandoned.&quot;
				<lb />
				&quot;67. Assuming that the advertisement is in respect of the same
				<lb />
				DRP or substantially the same DRP, non-receipt of bids now may or
				<lb />
				may not be indicative of the viability of implementing construction
				<lb />
				of saleable portion of the said project which would
				<lb />
				finance/reimburse the developer for the cost incurred for the
				<lb />
				rehabilitation portion of the said project. Moreover, under the said
				<lb />
				contract the DRP could have been suitably modified, if, after so
				<lb />
				many years, the original DRP was sought to be implemented. To
				<lb />
				conclude that no premium would have been fetched for the
				<lb />
				saleable portion of the said project amounts to saying that the
				<lb />
				project cannot be implemented at all because the cost of
				<lb />
				rehabilitation of slum dwellers in rehabilitation buildings cannot
				<lb />
				be recovered and no profit can be earned at all by the developer
				<lb />
				by developing the saleable buildings by utilizing the FSI available
				<lb />
				to the developer for such redevelopment or the profit would not
				<lb />
				cover the cost of rehabilitation.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				&quot;68. The Respondent has desisted from saying that the entire
				<lb />
				project is unviable. The advertisement in question on the contrary
				<lb />
				suggests that the Respondent still considers that the project is
				<lb />
				viable. It is also somewhat surprising that at the concluding stage
				<lb />
				of the present arbitration proceedings, an advertisement was
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				suddenly issued by the Respondent inviting tenders for the said
				<lb />
				project.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				&quot;69. In our considered view, the last minute attempt was nothing
				<lb />
				but an attempt on the part of the Respondent to create some
				<lb />
				evidence during the course of hearing by way of an after-thought
				<lb />
				to dislodge the claim of the Claimant. No permission was sought
				<lb />
				from the Tribunal to float this global tender, when the matter was
				<lb />
				subjudice before the arbitral tribunal. No material is produced to
				<lb />
				justify the invitation for global tenders during the course of the
				<lb />
				arbitration. No material is produced to show as to when and why
				<lb />
				the decision to float global tenders was taken ; or who were parties
				<lb />
				to the said decision. Not a single responsible officer of the
				<lb />
				Respondent stepped into the witness box to throw light on the
				<lb />
				questions raised herein. Had a responsible officer of the
				<lb />
				Respondent stepped into the witness box, the Claimant would have
				<lb />
				got an opportunity to cross-examine the witness to challenge the
				<lb />
				evidence sought to be created during the course of the hearing by
				<lb />
				way of an after-thought.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				&quot;70.
				<lb />
				The witnesses, who were examined were junior officers
				<lb />
				having absolutely no personal knowledge in relation to the
				<lb />
				questions raised herein. In our considered view the Respondent
				<lb />
				has not succeeded in showing that the project was completely
				<lb />
				unviable and that SRA would not have earned any premium from
				<lb />
				the developers as contemplated.&quot;
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				90.
				<lb />
				In my opinion and as rightly contended on behalf of the
				<lb />
				Petitioner the arbitral tribunal in reaching to the above conclusion, has
				<lb />
				completely discarded the substantive evidence on record, namely that the
				<lb />
				respondent was not in a position to substantiate, as to what was being
				<lb />
				advertised, on 30 January 2016 was not under the scheme as envisaged in
				<lb />
				the year 2007 for which &apos;expression of interest&apos; were invited and the
				<lb />
				bidding process was required to be aborted, as far back as in 2011, as
				<lb />
				noted above. To my mind, one would be totally at a loss, to discern as to
				<lb />
				how the arbitral tribunal could accept the respondent&apos;s case of the 2007
				<lb />
				DRP being continued by the Petitioner by issuing advertisement on 30
				<lb />
				January 2016, so as to conclude that the DRP relevant to the PMC
				<lb />
				agreement was alive, when the evidence was otherwise. Even the
				<lb />
				Respondent had accepted the dead end of the road of the 2007-DRP as
				<lb />
				recorded by this Court in the previous litigation as arising from the first
				<lb />
				award.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				91.
				<lb />
				Further, the observations of the arbitral tribunal in paragraph
				<lb />
				69 of the impugned award to the effect &quot;In our considered view, the last
				<lb />
				minute attempt was nothing but an attempt on the part of the Respondent
				<lb />
				to create some evidence during the course of hearing by way of an after-
				<lb />
				thought to dislodge the claim of the Claimant...&quot; are beyond
				<lb />
				comprehension. It is an observation based on no evidence. It is difficult to
				<lb />
				accept a reasonable body of persons and that too an arbitral tribunal being
				<lb />
				well aware of the parameters of the adjudication before it, making such
				<lb />
				observations on a public body like the Petitioner, that issuing the
				<lb />
				advertisement dated 30 January 2016 was a last minute attempt on the
				<lb />
				part of the petitioner to create evidence to dislodge the claim of the
				<lb />
				respondent. Observations as serious as these could not have been made so
				<lb />
				lightly against a public body, unless there was overwhelming material to
				<lb />
				support such observation, when in fact there was none. In fact there is an
				<lb />
				apparent contradiction in the arbitral tribunal making such observation in
				<lb />
				as much as in paragraph 35 of the impugned award the arbitral tribunal
				<lb />
				rejected the Respondent&apos;s case of malafides in law as also malafides of its
				<lb />
				officers. Further it is on the basis of this advertisement the arbitral tribunal
				<lb />
				comes to a conclusion that the DRP is still alive and has proceeded to
				<lb />
				award damages and on the other hand observes that the advertisement
				<lb />
				was an afterthought to create some evidence on the part of the petitioner
				<lb />
				to dislodge the respondent&apos;s claim. The paradox is apparent and fatal to
				<lb />
				the legality of the award.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				92.
				<lb />
				This apart, the arbitral tribunal completely lost sight and
				<lb />
				ignored its jurisdiction when the observations were made in the in the
				<lb />
				same paragraph to the effect &quot;..... No permission was sought from the
				<lb />
				Tribunal to float this global tender, when the matter was subjudice before
				<lb />
				the arbitral tribunal.&quot; I am so astonished as to how such observation could
				<lb />
				be made by the arbitral tribunal when the role of the arbitral tribunal was
				<lb />
				merely of an adjudicatory authority qua the contractual rights of the
				<lb />
				parties, and when surely it did not wield any other jurisdiction much less a
				<lb />
				substantive jurisdiction vested in the Court of law. This is another facet of
				<lb />
				the perversity of the findings of the arbitral tribunal, on which is based the
				<lb />
				super structure, leading to the award of damages.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				93.
				<lb />
				Now coming to the actual claim as made by the Respondent.
				<lb />
				Respondent claimed damages firstly for loss of profit or in the alternative
				<lb />
				compensation for plans and drawings; secondly for loss of opportunity and
				<lb />
				goodwill; and thirdly for harassment and mental anguish. The later two
				<lb />
				claims were rejected hence no discussion is called for on these two claims.
				<lb />
				As noted above the claim for loss of profit has been granted by the arbitral
				<lb />
				tribunal.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				94.
				<lb />
				The claim for damages for loss of profit was made based on
				<lb />
				Clause 6 of the Contract as under:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				(i)
				<lb />
				Claim for post tender activities being 75% of 1% of Rs.5600 crores
				<lb />
				being an amount of Rs.42 crores as per clause 6.1(A)(ii) of the PMC
				<lb />
				Agreement. and;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				(ii) Claim for for an amount of 0.5% being the additional entitlement
				<lb />
				in the total premium &apos;to be received&apos; by the petitioner as per Clause 6.1(B)
				<lb />
				of the PMC Agreement if the DRP was to proceed , quantified by the
				<lb />
				respondent at Rs.148 crores.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				95.
				<lb />
				Thus these claims for an amount of Rs.42 crores and Rs.148
				<lb />
				crores were made by the respondents on a presumption/estimate that
				<lb />
				these were the amounts which would have been received by the
				<lb />
				respondent if the contract was to progress. The respondent, however,
				<lb />
				deducted the projected cost for manpower and administrative expenses,
				<lb />
				which according to it was to be incurred amounting to Rs.71.28 crores
				<lb />
				and deducting this amount, made a claim for a sum of Rs.118.72 crores
				<lb />
				that is Rs.42 crores plus Rs.148 crores minus Rs.78.28 crores.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				96.
				<lb />
				In support of these claims, the respondents examined two
				<lb />
				witnesses namely Mr.Girish Ranade (C.W.2), founder and Director of
				<lb />
				M/s.Ballal Engineering Pvt. Ltd. and Ms Gauri Shah (C.W.3), Chartered
				<lb />
				Accountant and Director of C.C. Chokshi Advisors Pvt. Ltd., a company
				<lb />
				engaged in providing financial advisory services.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				97.
				<lb />
				Both M/s.Ballal Engineering Pvt.Ltd. And M/s.C.C.Chokshi
				<lb />
				Advisors Pvt.Ltd. had prepared their estimates of loss of profit to the
				<lb />
				respondents on the basis of the material provided by the respondents/
				<lb />
				claimants. This is an admitted position. It is also an admitted position on
				<lb />
				record that the complete report of M/s.Ballal Engineering Pvt.Ltd was not
				<lb />
				on record of the arbitral tribunal, as the measurement sheets and
				<lb />
				estimates which accompanied this report was not produced by the
				<lb />
				respondent. Thus, concededly the petitioner could not cross examine the
				<lb />
				witnesses on these measurements and estimates. However, despite this
				<lb />
				basic lack of material, the tribunal has proceeded to accept this report on
				<lb />
				the following reasoning in paragraph 49:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;49. These reports have been challenged by the Respondent on
				<lb />
				the ground that these reports are incomplete because the
				<lb />
				measurement sheets and estimates have not been produced. The
				<lb />
				Respondent had taken inspection of these reports. They, however,
				<lb />
				did not ask for the measurement sheets and estimates. As far as the
				<lb />
				witness is concerned, he has clearly set out in his reports that these
				<lb />
				measurement sheets and estimates accompanied his report and the
				<lb />
				final conclusions which he has set out are based on these
				<lb />
				measurements and estimates. In our view, the reports cannot be
				<lb />
				discarded as hypothetical simply because these measurement sheets
				<lb />
				and estimates which accompanied that report have not been
				<lb />
				produced by the Claimant. It is true that the respondent could not
				<lb />
				cross examine the witness on these measurements and estimates. At
				<lb />
				the same time, these measurements and estimates have also not
				<lb />
				been called for by the respondent. The witness has answered
				<lb />
				questions put to him in cross-examination in a forthright manner.
				<lb />
				He is not in any way connected with the claimant. These reports
				<lb />
				cannot be discarded. The figures set out by him have not been
				<lb />
				questioned on merit. No material evidences is led by the respondent
				<lb />
				to dislodge or to rebut the expert evidence tendered by the
				<lb />
				Claimant.&quot;
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				98.
				<lb />
				Similarly in respect of the report submitted of C.C. Chokshi
				<lb />
				Advisors Pvt. Ltd. Ms.Gauri Shah (C.W.3) director led evidence. It is clear
				<lb />
				that the entire analysis in respect of the report was on the basis of the
				<lb />
				information furnished by the respondent and gathered by the said concern
				<lb />
				from Public domain on the basis of which the respondent made a claim of
				<lb />
				Rs.148 crores. The relevant observations of the tribunal, in this regard
				<lb />
				can be found in paragraphs 50 and 51 of the impugned award which reads
				<lb />
				thus:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				50.
				<lb />
				The claimant also relies upon a report from financial consultant
				<lb />
				Messrs. C.C. Chokshi Advisors Private Ltd. The claimant has led the
				<lb />
				evidence of a Director of C.C. Chokshi Advisors Private Ltd. Ms. Gauri
				<lb />
				Shah, (RW-3) who is a Chartered Accountant. She has deposed to a
				<lb />
				report issued by the said firm relating to estimation of reasonable
				<lb />
				premium that could have been offered by the developers who would
				<lb />
				have participated in the DRP, to that Government of Maharashtra based
				<lb />
				on the profitability in implementing the DRP as per the tender
				<lb />
				documents. She has prepared the report and has been authorized by her
				<lb />
				firm of financial advisors to give evidence in this matter. The report is at
				<lb />
				Exhibit 93 at page 578 to 594 of Claimant&apos;s Compilation volume 2. The
				<lb />
				report states that the claimant company had requested the said firm to
				<lb />
				estimate a reasonable premium that could have been offered by the
				<lb />
				developers to the government based on their profitability vide volume 6
				<lb />
				of the commercial part of the tender documents. The report states that
				<lb />
				the analysis was undertaken on the basis of information relating to the
				<lb />
				company furnished to the firm by the management of the company and
				<lb />
				information available in public domain regarding other players in the
				<lb />
				industry. The following particulars are given in the report relating to the
				<lb />
				information given by the claimant company:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				1.
				<lb />
				A presentation on the Dharavi project made by the
				<lb />
				claimant.
				<lb />
			</item>

				2. Tender documents for the project
				<lb />
				3. Feasibility study conducted by Ballal Engineering Private
				<lb />
				Limited of the said project
				<lb />
				4. Financial viability study done by the company of the said
				<lb />
				project
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				5. Financials (top-level view)
				<lb />

				6. Assumptions

				9. Final, and set of deviations (CSD)
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				51.
				<lb />
				The report states that the firm estimates that the developer may
				<lb />
				potentially offer premium in the range of 35%-40% of the profits of the
				<lb />
				project. This is based on the sale price of the free sale portion of the
				<lb />
				project. The total cost in crores for the rehab portion, residential free
				<lb />
				sale, commercial free sale, infrastructure development, Greenway, and
				<lb />
				various other heads including premium and administrative overheads
				<lb />
				has been estimated at Rs.82,513 crores. The total cost without premium
				<lb />
				is estimated at Rs.59,243 crores. The premium (35%) per square foot
				<lb />
				based on total built-up area of 4,31,40,584 sq.ft. Based on the sale price
				<lb />
				of Rs.17,500 per square foot has been estimated at Rs.23,271 crores
				<lb />
				while premium at 40% based on the estimated sale price of Rs.17,500 is
				<lb />
				estimated at Rs.26,596 crores. At the sale price of Rs.19.500 per square
				<lb />
				foot the premium as 35% of profit before taxes comes to Rs.25,969
				<lb />
				crores and the premium as 40% of the profit comes to Rs.29,679 crores
				<lb />
				(cf. Page 15 of the report). Based on this estimate the claimant has
				<lb />
				calculated expected premium to the government/SRA as Rs.29,600
				<lb />
				crores (40% of the profits on the basis of sale price of Rs.19,500). The
				<lb />
				share of the claimant as 0.5% comes to Rs.148 crores. The claimant has
				<lb />
				adopted this figure which is the highest figure estimated in the said
				<lb />
				report.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				99.
				<lb />
				The petitioner urged before the arbitral tribunal that the
				<lb />
				report of C.C.Chokshi Advisors Pvt. Ltd. is also required to be totally
				<lb />
				discarded as it contains hypothetical estimates of the premium to be
				<lb />
				received. This was being urged firstly contending that there was no post
				<lb />
				tender work undertaken by the respondents. The work itself would have
				<lb />
				taken several years and the contract itself provided for a period of seven
				<lb />
				years, hence, it was not possible to have a reasonable estimate as to what
				<lb />
				would be the market price of the saleable portion after a time lapse of
				<lb />
				seven years. It was further urged that C.C. Chokshi Advisors Pvt. Ltd. had
				<lb />
				taken into consideration the calculation as per the report of M/s.Ballal
				<lb />
				Engineering Pvt. Ltd., which could not have been relied, in the absence of
				<lb />
				supporting material namely calculation and measurement sheets which
				<lb />
				were not before the arbitral tribunal. In short, the contention of the
				<lb />
				petitioner in assailing this report was that damages could not have been
				<lb />
				awarded on the basis of hypothesis. It was also contended that the
				<lb />
				respondents could not have been put in a better position than what if the
				<lb />
				contract was carried. The petitioner accordingly contended that the
				<lb />
				respondent had totally failed to prove any case on damages. The arbitral
				<lb />
				tribunal however accepted Chokshi&apos;s report which was in turn based on
				<lb />
				Ballal&apos;s report on a very peculiar reasoning namely that the respondents
				<lb />
				ought to have produced material to displace these reports. This reasoning
				<lb />
				can be found in paragraphs 55, 56, 60 and 61 of the Award which read
				<lb />
				thus:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				55.
				<lb />
				In our view, the Chokshi report cannot be rejected on the
				<lb />
				ground that it has relied upon the Ballal report for calculating the
				<lb />
				area available in respect of saleable portion and rehabilitation
				<lb />
				portion. As set out hereinabove, the calculations in the Ballal report
				<lb />
				cannot be rejected simply because detailed documentation which
				<lb />
				supported the calculations has not been produced. The respondent
				<lb />
				did not ask for it. Nor did the respondent produced any alternative
				<lb />
				figures which according to it were valid.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				56.
				<lb />
				Another important circumstance is not entering into the
				<lb />
				witness box by any officer of the respondent conversant with the
				<lb />
				project. No responsible officer appeared on behalf of the respondent
				<lb />
				to depose in relation to the stopping of the project, or the viability of
				<lb />
				the project or any relevant aspect of it including the expected
				<lb />
				premium, if any, from the saleable portion of the project.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				... ... ... ....
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				60.
				<lb />
				A claim of this nature for loss of profit is bound to be in a
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				sense hypothetical because there cannot be any material about the
				<lb />
				future profit which is lost. This has to be estimated on the basis of
				<lb />
				the available relevant material. In the present case the estimate is
				<lb />
				based on the terms of payment under the contract in question. The
				<lb />
				area which was covered by the DRP is known. The area available for
				<lb />
				rehabilitation of existing slum dwellers and the corresponding
				<lb />
				saleable area available to the developer on the basis of the
				<lb />
				rehabilitation area is also governed by the Development Control
				<lb />
				Rules framed by the respondent and is known. On the basis, if the
				<lb />
				saleable area is ascertained, and the market price anticipated for
				<lb />
				such saleable area is determined on the basis of prevailing market
				<lb />
				rates with an increase in percentage which the experts in the area
				<lb />
				anticipate, it cannot be considered unreasonable looking to the very
				<lb />
				nature of the project and the number of years over which it was to be
				<lb />
				executed.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				61.
				<lb />
				The respondent has, however, pointed out that the sale price
				<lb />
				would be affected by the fact that a very large area for residential
				<lb />
				and commercial purposes would suddenly become available in the
				<lb />
				market. This would result in a decrease in prices. This is accepted by
				<lb />
				Gauri Shah (see question and answer 148 in cross-examination).
				<lb />
				The increase, however, in the residential and commercial premises
				<lb />
				would be spread over the years. Nevertheless there may be some
				<lb />
				impact on price on a large number of such premises coming into the
				<lb />
				market. We would therefore prefer to accept the lowest estimate
				<lb />
				given in the Chokshi report in respect of the premium for the
				<lb />
				saleable portion. If we take the sale price at Rs.17,500 per square
				<lb />
				foot, the premium earned per square foot at the rate of 35% comes
				<lb />
				to Rs.23,271 crores. The claimant&apos;s share of 0.5% of this premium
				<lb />
				comes to Rs.116 crores. Therefore the amount payable to the
				<lb />
				claimant for his share of premium can be taken as Rs.116 crores
				<lb />
				instead of Rs.148 crores as claimed.&quot;
				<lb />
				(emphais supplied)
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				100.
				<lb />
				On a reading of the above findings of the arbitral tribunal, to
				<lb />
				my mind the petitioner is correct in contending that the arbitral tribunal
				<lb />
				has wholly proceeded on a hypothesis, that the figures/amounts of loss of
				<lb />
				profit which are reflected in these reports were sacrosanct when the
				<lb />
				measurement sheets leading to these estimates were not on record. The
				<lb />
				observations of the arbitral tribunal in paragraph 61 would clearly
				<lb />
				indicate that the lowest estimate of the premium which would be received
				<lb />
				for the saleable portion set out in the Chokshi&apos;s report is accepted, which
				<lb />
				is the sale price of Rs.17,500/-per square foot which according to the
				<lb />
				tribunal is at the rate of 35% which would be Rs.23,271 crores. The
				<lb />
				respondents&apos; share is considered by the tribunal at 0.5% of this premium,
				<lb />
				which would be about Rs.116 crores. Thus according to the arbitral
				<lb />
				tribunal the amount payable to the respondent towards its share of
				<lb />
				premium as per Clause 6.1(B) be taken at Rs.116 crores instead of Rs.148
				<lb />
				crores as claimed by the respondents. The arbitral tribunal has supported
				<lb />
				this conclusion also referring to a letter dated 9 March 2011 which was a
				<lb />
				letter of CEO DRP to the Secretary Housing, who had estimated the
				<lb />
				premium for the development to be undertaken by MHADA at Rs.31156
				<lb />
				crores. Admittedly, neither the author of this letter was examined by the
				<lb />
				respondent on the basis of which such an estimate was made by the said
				<lb />
				officer of the respondent or anyone from M/s.Darashaw &amp; Co. Pvt.Ltd who
				<lb />
				had made estimates, and on what basis, was not before the arbitral
				<lb />
				tribunal. Thus the letter dated 9 March 2011 could in no manner amount
				<lb />
				to any admission in regard to the profits to be earned by the petitioner.
				<lb />
				When one speaks of profits there are so many other intricacies of
				<lb />
				deductions etc. to arrive at the actual figure of gross profit. These basic
				<lb />
				requirements in considering the respondent&apos;s plea on this letter are
				<lb />
				completely discarded by the arbitral tribunal. Further an estimate cannot
				<lb />
				have any sanctity. Thus, there was no cogent material as to whether the
				<lb />
				estimate was the correct estimate as contained in the said letter and
				<lb />
				whether it was at all accepted by the State Government.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				101.
				<lb />
				On the above foundation, the arbitral tribunal decided to
				<lb />
				award damages in favour of the respondent by the following observations
				<lb />
				as made in paragraph 63:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				63.
				<lb />
				The total fees which the claimant would have recovered had
				<lb />
				the DRP been executed therefore comes to Rs.116+42 (fees for post-
				<lb />
				tender work) = 158 crores. The claimant has deducted his expenses,
				<lb />
				which, according to him, come to Rs.71.28 crores. He has deposed
				<lb />
				that this amount consists of manpower cost of Rs.59.46 crores and
				<lb />
				corporate office employee costs etc. of Rs.11.82 crores. There is no
				<lb />
				effective cross examination of Mukesh Mehta in this regard. So we
				<lb />
				have to accept this figure of Rs.71.28 crores. Deducting this amount
				<lb />
				from the total fee of Rs.158 crores, loss of profit comes to Rs.86.72
				<lb />
				crores.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				102.
				<lb />
				In regard to the evidence of the petitioner, it was the
				<lb />
				petitioner&apos;s contention that, it was sufficient for them to examine the
				<lb />
				Officers who were concerned with the issuance of the advertisement dated
				<lb />
				30 January 2016, namely, Shri Harish Warde Assistant Public Relations
				<lb />
				Officer, Shri Mahesh R.Gadekar Public Relations Officer both working at
				<lb />
				the relevant period and Shri Harshad Karade Information Technology
				<lb />
				Officer of the Petitioners, since 8 August 2010.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				103.
				<lb />
				These witnesses of the Petitioners, were fully cross-examined
				<lb />
				by the Respondents. It is important to note that even under the
				<lb />
				advertisement dated 30 January 2016 there were no bids received. This
				<lb />
				has clearly come in the respondent&apos;s cross-examination of the Petitioner&apos;s
				<lb />
				witness Shri Harish Warde (RW-1). Thus, it was a clear position, even qua
				<lb />
				the new advertisement that even as far back in July 2016, no bids were
				<lb />
				received. The fact remained that not only under the 2007 &apos;expression of
				<lb />
				interest&apos; but also under the DRP relevant to the 30 January 2016
				<lb />
				advertisement, no bids could be received.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				104.
				<lb />
				From these circumstances, two basic facets in regard to the
				<lb />
				respondent&apos;s case on damages would emerge. Firstly, that the the
				<lb />
				entitlement of the respondent to receive any fees under clause 6.1A (ii) of
				<lb />
				Rs.42 crores for the post-tender activities was totally illusory. I wonder as
				<lb />
				to how the post tender fees could be included by any standard in grant of
				<lb />
				damages and as to how it can be an item under the head &apos;loss of profit.
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				This objection although is raised by the petitioner, the same has not been
				<lb />
				dealt by the arbitral tribunal. Secondly as a logical corollary, the tender
				<lb />
				having failed, there was no question of any development activity to be
				<lb />
				undertaken, so that any premium could be received by the Petitioner in
				<lb />
				regard to which, claims for damages were made by the Respondents in the
				<lb />
				arbitral proceedings. This more particularly when in Clause 6.1(B) the
				<lb />
				parties agreed that &quot;PMC shall additionally receive 0.5% of the &quot;total
				<lb />
				premium received&quot; by SRA.&quot; In this regard the petitioner would also be
				<lb />
				correct in its contention, as also urged before the arbitral tribunal that the
				<lb />
				respondent cannot seek damages, of a measure to be put in a better
				<lb />
				position, than what it could have been, if the contract was to be
				<lb />
				performed.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				105.
				<lb />
				I am in agreement with Mr. Khambatta, learned senior
				<lb />
				counsel for the petitioner when he would urge that the arbitral tribunal,
				<lb />
				has completely overlooked the nature of the project, a relevant factor in
				<lb />
				considering a claim for damages. According to him, the Dharavi
				<lb />
				Redevelopment Project, was not a ordinary construction project, it was a
				<lb />
				project as pointed out by Mr. Khambata involving number of complexities
				<lb />
				which even included land acquisition. The success of the project depended
				<lb />
				on several contingent factors, on which depended the fees to be payable to
				<lb />
				the project management consultant-the respondent. In the absence of a
				<lb />
				project in its real sense there was no question of any services being
				<lb />
				rendered by the respondent. It would be correct for the petitioner to
				<lb />
				contend that neither a strait-jacket formula or ordinary norms of valuation
				<lb />
				could be applied for the different knotty areas of Dharavi. Mr. Khambatta,
				<lb />
				would thus be correct in his contention when he argues that the Choksy
				<lb />
				report read with the Ballal report could never have formed the basis for
				<lb />
				arriving at any figure of the damages which completely omitted several
				<lb />
				complexities of the project in making illusary estimates.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				106.
				<lb />
				Be that as it may, the expert evidence firstly Mr. Girish
				<lb />
				Ranade (CW-2) , Director of Ballal Engineering Private Limited and of
				<lb />
				Ms.Gauri Shah(CW-3) Director of M/s C. C.Choksi Private Ltd. (a
				<lb />
				Company providing financial advisory services) as accepted by the arbitral
				<lb />
				tribunal is also seriously criticised on behalf of the petitioner. In so far as,
				<lb />
				evidence of Mr. Girish Ranade -CW 2 is concerned, admittedly it was the
				<lb />
				Respondent who had provided him with drawings and specifications for
				<lb />
				the project on which basis a report came to be prepared by Mr.Girish
				<lb />
				Ranade&apos;s Company, interalia in regard to the cost of typical rehabilitation
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				132
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				building, cost of estimation of sell building, infrastructure development,
				<lb />
				amenities building and greenway etc. This report contained cost of
				<lb />
				construction for the concerned work at the rate of per square foot. The
				<lb />
				foundation for these figures namely the measurement sheets and
				<lb />
				estimates. In regard to the evidence of this witness, the arbitral tribunal
				<lb />
				has come to a conclusion that the figures set out by this witness had not
				<lb />
				been questioned on merits and that no material was led by the
				<lb />
				Respondent or dislodged or rebut this expert evidence of this witness.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				107.
				<lb />
				Mr.Khambatta, the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner
				<lb />
				has fervently criticized the findings of Arbitral Tribunal to submit that the
				<lb />
				evidence of Mr. Girish Ranade was required to be discarded in totality.
				<lb />
				Mr. Khambata has drawn my attention to the Ballal Report to submit that
				<lb />
				the report was based on drawings/specifications, information and
				<lb />
				documents provided by the respondent which is not in dispute and while
				<lb />
				doing so all the supporting documents did not form part of arbitral record.
				<lb />
				Mr.Khambata&apos;s contention is that, the Ballal Report is nothing more than
				<lb />
				summary of detail estimate and measurement sheet, which were not
				<lb />
				placed on record of the Arbitral Tribunal. In this regard Mr. Khambata
				<lb />
				has referred to question No.13 in the cross examination of Girish Ranade
				<lb />
				(CW-2) whereby Mr.Girish Ranade has confirmed that detail estimated
				<lb />
				measurement sheets were prepared section-wise.
				<lb />
				However, only
				<lb />
				summaries were attached to the report.
				<lb />
				Mr. Khambata also refers to
				<lb />
				question no.35 in the cross examination of Girish Ranade (CW 2) wherein
				<lb />
				he admits that without supporting documents Ballal Report was produced
				<lb />
				by the Respondent and hence it was a incomplete report. Mr. Khambata
				<lb />
				would thus submit that the Ballal Report ought to have been rejected by
				<lb />
				the Arbitral Tribunal being incomplete. On the other hand Mr. Jagtiani has
				<lb />
				supported the report to contend that it provided all material which was
				<lb />
				sufficient for the tribunal to consider the damages as suffered by the
				<lb />
				Respondent. He would submit that there was no challenge to this report
				<lb />
				and/or there was no contrary material so that this report would be
				<lb />
				disbelieved. Hence according to Mr Jagtiani the petitioner&apos;s submission
				<lb />
				that as the measurement sheets were not available the report should be
				<lb />
				discarded, cannot be accepted.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				108.
				<lb />
				In my opinion, there is much substance in the contentions as
				<lb />
				urged by Mr.Khambata. Even the Tribunal in paragraph 48 of the
				<lb />
				impugned award has noted that the Ballal Report was merely a tabulated
				<lb />
				summary of conclusions arrived at and further in paragraph 49, it was
				<lb />
				observed that the petitioner could not cross examine this witness on this
				<lb />
				measurement and estimate.
				<lb />
				If this was the evidentiary position on
				<lb />
				record, the Arbitral Tribunal could not have attributed any weightage to
				<lb />
				the Ballal Report. Moreover the contents of the Report ought to have been
				<lb />
				held to be hypothetical by the arbitral tribunal, in absence of any
				<lb />
				foundation of these estimates.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				109.
				<lb />
				Similarly, in regard to the evidence of RW 3 Gauri Shah, the
				<lb />
				Director of M/C C.C. Choksi Private Limited who deposed to the Choksi
				<lb />
				Report, the plight is not different.
				<lb />
				The Choksi Report estimated the
				<lb />
				expected premium that could be fetched by the petitioner, if the project
				<lb />
				was to progress. This Report was based on assumptions and estimate
				<lb />
				provided by Mr.Mukesh Mehta, Chairman of the Respondent. The Report
				<lb />
				itself states that, the analysis was undertaken on the basis of information
				<lb />
				furnished by the Management of the Respondent and information
				<lb />
				available in public domain regarding other players in the Industry. The
				<lb />
				following contents of the Choksi Report itself made acceptance of the
				<lb />
				report doubtful much less by the Arbitral Tribunal adjudicating damages.
				<lb />
				The relevant portion reads thus;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;In the course of the valuation, we were provided with both
				<lb />
				written and verbal information, including financial and operating
				<lb />
				data. We have evaluated the information provided to us by the
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				Company through broad inquiry and analysis (but have not carried
				<lb />
				out a due diligence or audit or review of the Company for the
				<lb />
				purpose of this engagement, nor have we independently
				<lb />
				investigated or otherwise verified the data provided). We have
				<lb />
				been given to understand by the Company that they have not
				<lb />
				omitted any relevant and material factors. Accordingly, as regards
				<lb />
				information provided by the Company we do not express any
				<lb />
				opinion or offer any form of assurance regarding it accuracy and
				<lb />
				completeness. We assume no responsibility for any errors in the
				<lb />
				above information furnished by the Company and their impact on
				<lb />
				the present exercise.
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				110.
				<lb />
				In my opinion the above statement in the Choksi report was
				<lb />
				ex-facie sufficient to render the same worthless, in the context of assessing
				<lb />
				damages. This apart, the Petitioner would be correct in its contention that
				<lb />
				the Arbitral Tribunal could not have blindly accepted the Choksi Report for
				<lb />
				any purposes when Respondent&apos;s witness Mr.Mukesh Mehta, himself in his
				<lb />
				evidence in paragraph no.108 of the affidavit in lieu of examination-in-
				<lb />
				chief stated that he requested the said Advisors to estimate reasonable
				<lb />
				premium that could have been offered by developers to the Government of
				<lb />
				Maharashtra ranging from Rs.23,270/-crores to Rs.29,600/-crores and
				<lb />
				accordingly, Choksi Report estimates premium in the range of Rs.23,271/-
				<lb />
				crores to Rs.29,679/-crores. The petitioner would thus be correct that a
				<lb />
				tailor made report could never be a foundation to award damages. It was
				<lb />
				incumbent on the arbitral tribunal to consider these vital aspects of the
				<lb />
				respondent&apos;s evidence. However, the arbitral tribunal has totally ignored
				<lb />
				and/or turned a blind eye to even refer to this evidence. In my opinion,
				<lb />
				evidence of Miss Gauri Shah and Choksi Report ought to have been held to
				<lb />
				be totally inadmissible. The arbitral tribunal ought to have applied a
				<lb />
				prudent rationale of a holistic appreciation and assessment of evidence. I
				<lb />
				would fail to understand that in this situation as to how the Arbitral
				<lb />
				Tribunal could have proceeded to award damages either on the basis of
				<lb />
				Ballal Report or Choksi Report, when the Report lacked basic foundation
				<lb />
				to arrive at conclusions as contained in these reports. Petitioner&apos;s
				<lb />
				submission assailing the findings as made in award on these reports are
				<lb />
				required to be accepted in totality. An award as rendered by the arbitral
				<lb />
				tribunal ignoring vital facets of the evidence would amount to a perversity,
				<lb />
				a ground sufficient to set aside the award.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				111.
				<lb />
				Mr.Jagtiani&apos;s contention that this is a case where an adverse
				<lb />
				inference was required to be drawn against the petitioner as the petitioner
				<lb />
				did not examine any witness on the reason set out for termination and the
				<lb />
				information on the project cost which was completely in the domain of the
				<lb />
				petitioner. I do not agree. The fundamental fallacy in this argument is that
				<lb />
				the petitioner could not be expected to discharge the burden of proof of
				<lb />
				the respondent. It was for the respondent to prove whatever the
				<lb />
				respondent asserted. It was also open to the respondent to
				<lb />
				summon/examine whichever witnesses it desired. The respondent
				<lb />
				examined only three witnesses, the first being Mr.Mehta, and Mr.Girish
				<lb />
				Ranade and Ms.Gauri Shah. The respondent thus was required to be
				<lb />
				content with the evidence of these three witnesses. The respondent cannot
				<lb />
				expect that the lacunae in the evidence of their witnesses should be filled
				<lb />
				up by the petitioner. It is not a situation that the respondent was
				<lb />
				precluded from examining any of the officers of the petitioner to give
				<lb />
				evidence. Thus there was no question of any adverse inference being
				<lb />
				drawn against the petitioner. This contention of Mr.Jagtiani hence requires
				<lb />
				to be rejected.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				112.
				<lb />
				There is another significant aspect as urged on behalf of the
				<lb />
				petitioner and which in my opinion would go to the root of the matter in
				<lb />
				the arbitral tribunal considering the claim for award of damages viz.
				<lb />
				whether it was permissible to place the respondent in a better position,
				<lb />
				then what the Respondent could have found itself, had the contract
				<lb />
				subsisted. Even assuming if it was to be presumed that advertisement
				<lb />
				dated 30 th January 2016 was issued under DRP as conceived in the year
				<lb />
				2004. However even under this new advertisement admittedly the
				<lb />
				petitioner did not receive any bid. Thus, there was not a remotest
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				138
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				possibility of the contract moving any further, so that, the respondent
				<lb />
				would be in position to undertake post-tender activities much less the
				<lb />
				contract still moving further so as to assume that the petitioner would
				<lb />
				receive any sale premium, from which the respondents could claim 0.5%
				<lb />
				of the amounts which would be received.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				113.
				<lb />
				A claim for damages cannot be made by a party to have any
				<lb />
				unjust enrichment or it should not confer a windfall on the claimant. It
				<lb />
				cannot exceed the loss actually suffered or likely to suffer. In awarding
				<lb />
				damages, it can never be that an unreasonable and disproportinoate deal
				<lb />
				is being foisted on a contracting party. It is a settled principle of law that
				<lb />
				damages for breach of contract are awarded to place the injured party in
				<lb />
				the same position in which it would have been had the contract was not
				<lb />
				broken. This would postulate that the damages have to be compensatory
				<lb />
				and not punitive or retributory.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				114.
				<lb />
				Now applying these norms to the facts of the present case, it
				<lb />
				is quite clear that the post tender activities which were defined along with
				<lb />
				the quantum of the fees for each of the activities were surely not to be
				<lb />
				performed as no bids were received. In this situation there was also no
				<lb />
				question of the petitioner undertaking any further development in regard
				<lb />
				to the DRP. Thus on both the counts there was no likelihood of any work
				<lb />
				to be done and consequently any loss being suffered by the respondent.
				<lb />
				Thus the claim of the respondent was presuming a contingency that the
				<lb />
				contract was to be performed. In this situation a stricter test was
				<lb />
				applicable of not only a breach of the contract fundamental to the contract
				<lb />
				or going to the root of the contract at the hands of the petitioner but also
				<lb />
				of having overwhelming material to quantify such damages.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				115.
				<lb />
				As noted above, the contract in question was not a
				<lb />
				construction contract as awarded to the respondent, it is a contract of an
				<lb />
				advisory nature. Although the respondent terms the project as its &quot;Skin in
				<lb />
				the same&quot; the same is not borne out by the PMC agreement. Thus surely
				<lb />
				norms which are required to be applied in case of breach of a construction
				<lb />
				contract where one of the contracting party possibly could procure
				<lb />
				material by incurring expenditure and would seek damages for such losses
				<lb />
				and for loss of business are inapplicable to the fact situation.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				116.
				<lb />
				The petitioner is correct in its contention that it was
				<lb />
				impossible to estimate how the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				140
				<lb />
				sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc
				<lb />
				could at all have proceeded in the absence of successive attempts to
				<lb />
				receive bids having failed. This was also the apprehension and expectation
				<lb />
				of the parties when they agreed to the specific termination clause, which
				<lb />
				provided an unequivocal right to the petitioner to terminate the PMC
				<lb />
				agreement in the event things coming to a standstill or the contract being
				<lb />
				abandoned or for any other reason. A prudent body like the arbitral
				<lb />
				tribunal was required to take these vital aspects into consideration rather
				<lb />
				than ignoring them.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				117.
				<lb />
				In my opinion the respondent by invoking the present
				<lb />
				arbitration and by making such ambitious claim for damages has traded
				<lb />
				on a path of futility, when tested not only in law but on the clear facts on
				<lb />
				record. If this be the position, then clearly the Arbitral Tribunal could not
				<lb />
				have placed the respondent in better position, then the respondent could
				<lb />
				have found itself in case contract was to be on foot, subsisting as surely
				<lb />
				the petitioner itself was not required to undertake any post tender
				<lb />
				activities or receive any premium so as to grant its share as per Clause
				<lb />
				No.6.1(B) of the PMC Agreement to the respondent.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				118.
				<lb />
				On behalf of the petitioner it is contended that this is a case
				<lb />
				wherein, on the record of the arbitral tribunal complete evidence qua the
				<lb />
				factual conspectus of the events was available and if this was to be so the
				<lb />
				arbitral tribunal was bound to look at these events in regard to the
				<lb />
				contract in question in considering award of damages. In this context on
				<lb />
				the principle which should be followed in awarding damages, reliance is
				<lb />
				placed on behalf of the petitioner on a celebrated decision of the House of
				<lb />
				Lords, Golden Strait Corpn vs.Nippon Yusen Kubishika Kaisha (2007)
				<lb />
				UKHI . The majority view is reflected in the opinions of their Lordships
				<lb />
				Lord Scott, Lord Carswell and Lord Brown. It was held that the principle
				<lb />
				that damages should be assessed as at the date of the breach, was not
				<lb />
				inflexible and the desirability of achieving certainty in commercial
				<lb />
				contracts was subject to the overriding compensatory principle that the
				<lb />
				damages awarded should represent no more than the value of the
				<lb />
				contractual benefits, of which the claimant has been deprived. If at the
				<lb />
				date of breach there had been a real possibility that an event would
				<lb />
				happen terminating the contract or otherwise reducing those contractual
				<lb />
				benefits, the quantum of damages might need to be reduced
				<lb />
				proportionately to reflect the estimated likelihood of that possibility
				<lb />
				materializing, but where such an event had already happened by the time
				<lb />
				damages were assessed, the Court should have regard to what had
				<lb />
				actually occurred, so that estimation was no longer necessary. In so
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				observing, Their Lordships have referred to the exposition of law in &quot;The
				<lb />
				Bwllfa and Merthyr Dare Stem Collieries (1891) vs The Pontypridd
				<lb />
				Waterworks Company&quot; 20 and &quot;Maredelanto Compania Naviera S.A.
				<lb />
				vs.Bergbau -Hamdel G.m.b.H. The Mihalis Angelo 21 . It would be apt to
				<lb />
				note the exposition in the opinion of Lord Scott which reads as under :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;29.
				<lb />
				My Lords, the answer to the question at issue must depend on
				<lb />
				principles of the law of contract. It is true that the context in this case is a
				<lb />
				charter party, a commercial contract. But the contractual principles of the
				<lb />
				common law relating to the assessment of damages are no different for
				<lb />
				charter parties, or for commercial contracts in general, than for contracts
				<lb />
				which do not bear that description. The fundamental principle governing the
				<lb />
				quantum of damages for breach
				<lb />
				of contract is long established and not in
				<lb />
				dispute. The damages should compensate the victim of the breach for the loss
				<lb />
				of his contractual bargain. The principle was succinctly stated by Parke B in
				<lb />
				Robinson v Harman (1848) 1 Ex 850, and remains as valid now as it was
				<lb />
				then:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;The rule of the common law is, that where a party sustains a loss by reason
				<lb />
				of a breach of contract, he is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the
				<lb />
				same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract had been
				<lb />
				performed.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				If the contract is a contract for performance over a period, whether for the
				<lb />
				performance of personal services, or for supply of goods, or, as here, a time
				<lb />
				charter the assessment of damages for breach must proceed on the same
				<lb />
				principle namely, the victim of the breach should be placed, so far as damages
				<lb />
				can do it, in the position he would have been in had the contract been
				<lb />
				performed.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				&quot;
			</item>
			<p>
				32. That contention, in my opinion, attributes to the assessment of damages
				<lb />
				at the date of breach rule an inflexibility which is inconsistent both with
				<lb />
				principle and with the authorities. The underlying principle is that the victim
				<lb />
				of breach of contract is entitled to damages representing the value or the
				<lb />
				contractual benefit to which he was entitled but of which he has deprived.
				<lb />
				He is entitled to be put in the same position, so far as money can do it, as if
				<lb />
				the contract had been performed. The assessment at the date of breach rule
				<lb />
				can usually achieve that result. But not always . In Milangosv George Frank
				<lb />
				(Textiles) Ltd (1976) AC 443, 468-469 Lord Wilberforce referred to &quot;the
				<lb />
				general rule&quot; that damages for breach of contract are assessed as at the date
				<lb />
				20 1903 AC 426
				<lb />
				21 1970 3 WLR 601.
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				of breach but went on to observe that:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;It is for the Courts, or for arbitrators to work out a solution in each case
				<lb />
				best adapted to giving the injured plaintiff that amount in damages
				<lb />
				which will most fairly compensate him for the wrong which he has
				<lb />
				suffered&quot;
				<lb />
				and, when considering the date at which a foreign money obligation should
				<lb />
				be converted into sterling, chose the date that &quot;gets nearest to securing to the
				<lb />
				creditor exactly what he bargained for&quot;. If a money award of damages for
				<lb />
				breach of contract provides to the creditor a lesser or a greater benefit than
				<lb />
				the creditor bargained for, the award fails, in either case, to provide a just
				<lb />
				result.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				36. The same would, in my opinion be true of any anticipatory breach the
				<lb />
				acceptance of which had terminated an executory contract. The contractual
				<lb />
				benefit for the loss of which the victim of the breach can seek compensation
				<lb />
				cannot escape the uncertainties of the future. If, at the time the assessment of
				<lb />
				damages takes place, there were nothing to suggest that the expected benefit
				<lb />
				of the executory contract would not if the contract had remained on foot,
				<lb />
				have duly accrued, then the quantum of damages would be unaffected by
				<lb />
				uncertainties that would be no more than conceptual. If there were a real
				<lb />
				possibility that an event would happen terminating the contract, or in some
				<lb />
				way reducing the contractual benefit to which the damages claimant would, if
				<lb />
				the contract had remained on foot, have become entitled, then the quantum
				<lb />
				of damages might need, in order to reflect the extent of the chance that that
				<lb />
				possibility might materialize, to be reduced proportionately. The lodestar is
				<lb />
				that the damages should represent the value of the contractual benefits of
				<lb />
				which the claimant had been deprived by the breach of contract, no less but
				<lb />
				also no more. But if a terminating event had happened, speculation would not
				<lb />
				be needed,an estimate of the extent of the chance of such a happening would
				<lb />
				no longer be necessary and, in relation to the period during which the
				<lb />
				contract would have remained executory had it not been for the
				<lb />
				terminating event, it would be apparent that the earlier anticipatory breach
				<lb />
				of contract had deprived the victim of the breach of nothing. In Bwlfa and
				<lb />
				Merthr Dare Steam Collieries (1891) Ltd vs Pontypridd Waterworks Co(1903)
				<lb />
				AC 426, 428, the Earl of Halsbury LC rejected the proposition that &quot;because
				<lb />
				you could not arrive at the true sum when the notice was given, you should
				<lb />
				shut your eyes, to the true sum now you do know it, because you could not
				<lb />
				have guessed it then&quot;and Lords Robertson said, at p 432, that &quot;estimate and
				<lb />
				conjecture are superceded facts as the proper media concludendi&quot; at,
				<lb />
				p.433,that &quot;as in this instance facts are available, they are not to be shut out.&quot;
				<lb />
				Their Lordships were not dealing with a contractual or tortious,damages
				<lb />
				issue but with the quantum of compensation to be paid under the Waterworks
				<lb />
				Clauses Act 1847 (10 &amp; 11 Vict c 17). Their approach however, is to my mind
				<lb />
				as apt for our purposes on this appeal as to theirs on that appeal.&quot;
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				38.
				<lb />
				The arguments of the owners offend the compensatory principle.
				<lb />
				They are seeking compensation exceeding the value of the contractual benefit
				<lb />
				as of which they were deprived. Their case requires the assessor to speculate
				<lb />
				about what might happen over the period 17 December 2001 to 6 December
				<lb />
				2005 regarding the occurrence of a clause 33 event and to shut his eyes to the
				<lb />
				actual happening of a clause 33 event in March 2003. The argued justification
				<lb />
				for thus offending the compensatory principle is that priority should be given
				<lb />
				to the so-called principle of certainty. My Lords, there is, in my opinion, no
				<lb />
				such principle. Certainty is a desideratum and a very important one,
				<lb />
				particularly in commercial contracts. But it is not a principle and must give
				<lb />
				way to principle. Otherwise incoherence of principle is the likely result. The
				<lb />
				achievement of certainty in relation to commercial contracts depends, I would
				<lb />
				suggest, on firm and settled principles of the law of contract rather than on
				<lb />
				the tailoring of principle in order to frustrate tactics of delay to which many
				<lb />
				litigants in many areas of litigation are wont to resort. Be that as it may, the
				<lb />
				compensatory principle that must underlie awards of contractual damages, is,
				<lb />
				in my opinion, clear and requires the appeal in the case to be dismissed. I
				<lb />
				wish also to express my agreement with the reasons given by my noble and
				<lb />
				learned friends, Lord Carwswell and Lord Brown of Eaton-under Heywood,
				<lb />
				for coming to the same conclusion.&quot;
				<lb />
				In my opinion the above observations are clearly applicable to the
				<lb />
				facts of the present case firstly for the reason that the clear events on
				<lb />
				record which depicted the real factual scenerio in arriving at the
				<lb />
				quantum of damages could not have been overlooked by the arbitral
				<lb />
				tribunal, and secondly the tribunal as a prudent body could not have
				<lb />
				overlooked as to whether in such a situation as the contract found itself
				<lb />
				to be in any damages could at all be awarded to be termed as loss of
				<lb />
				business.
				<lb />

				<lb />
				Mr.Jagtiani, learned Senior Counsel for the respondents has relied
				<lb />
				on some decisions on damages by way of loss of profit which are being
				<lb />
				discussed hereunder:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(i)
				<lb />
				Union of India Vs. Vaman Prestressing Co. Ltd. &amp; Anr 22 . This
				<lb />
				decision of the learned Single Judge, concerns a challenge to an arbitral
				<lb />
				award adjudicating a dispute under a works contract namely for
				<lb />
				&apos;manufacture and supply of PSC mono-block concrete. The original
				<lb />
				contract was amended and the respondent was required to manufacture
				<lb />
				additional quantity of 72000 sleepers than the original contractual
				<lb />
				quantity of 2,40,000 sleepers. The quantity was further added by the
				<lb />
				second amendment. The dispute between the parties pertained to whether
				<lb />
				the price of the sleepers shall be paid as per the original delivery period
				<lb />
				under the contract or should it admit a variation claimed by the
				<lb />
				respondent. The dispute was referred to arbitration. There were number
				<lb />
				of claims made. One of the claims being loss of overheads and profit. The
				<lb />
				arbitral tribunal granted price variation on 1,45,220 sleepers in
				<lb />
				accordance with the contract, as also granted freight reimbursement,
				<lb />
				compensation for delayed payment being interest on price variation as
				<lb />
				also loss of overheads and profits. It is in this context the Court
				<lb />
				considered the law of damages. However, what is relevant is, what the
				<lb />
				Court has observed in paragraphs 7 and 8 referring to the decision of the
				<lb />
				22 2019 SCC OnLine Bom 192
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				Supreme Court in A.T. Brij Paul Singh And Ors. vs State Of Gujarat 23 and
				<lb />
				the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in Mahanagar Gas Ltd. Vs.
				<lb />
				Babulal Uttamchand &amp; Co. 24 . The learned single Judge observed that the
				<lb />
				basic principle in awarding damages would only when the other
				<lb />
				contracting party commits a breach of the contract by improper recession
				<lb />
				and/or there is a breach of fundamental terms of the contract by one of
				<lb />
				the contracting party. In any case the learned Single Judge in this case was
				<lb />
				dealing with a works contract where the parameters are completely
				<lb />
				different. This decision in the present facts will not assist the Respondent.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(ii) In K.K. Cooperative Group Housing Society Ltd. v. Goel Associates 25
				<lb />
				a Division Bench of Delhi High Court was dealing with a contract entered
				<lb />
				by the appellant on 7 May 1988 with the respondent, whereby the services
				<lb />
				of the respondent were engaged to carry out the work of development of
				<lb />
				land allotted to the society and construction of different types of houses
				<lb />
				including providing electrical and sanitary installations and other services.
				<lb />
				The appellant society had raised certain deficiencies after three years of
				<lb />
				the contract entered between the parties and finally the appellant
				<lb />
				terminated the agreement vide letter dated 30 September 1991. The
				<lb />
				dispute between the parties was referred to arbitration. The arbitrator had
				<lb />
				framed two issues to be decided, firstly whether the agreement was valid
				<lb />
				and binding on both the parties; and secondly whether the appellant
				<lb />
				society terminated the contract awarded as per the agreement dated 7
				<lb />
				May 1988 unilaterally without reasonable cause, if so, to what amount
				<lb />
				was the claimant entitled as compensation and interest. Answering the
				<lb />
				first issue, it was held that it was a valid and binding contract. On the
				<lb />
				second issue, the arbitrator found that the agreement has been unilaterally
				<lb />
				revoked by the society without consideration of the respondent&apos;s reply,
				<lb />
				and therefore, he proceeded to grant an amount towards fee which would
				<lb />
				been payable to the respondent at 2.75% of the total cost of construction.
				<lb />
				Being an arbitration under the Arbitration Act,1940, the award was filed
				<lb />
				in the Court. The appellant had filed an application under Sections 30 and
				<lb />
				33 of the Arbitration Act 1940 raising objections. Learned Single Judge
				<lb />
				found no merit in the objections,however taking into consideration the
				<lb />
				fact that the respondent had actually not rendered any services, called
				<lb />
				upon the sole proprietor of the respondent to indicate whether he was
				<lb />
				ready to accept the lesser compensation instead of awarded amount. The
				<lb />
				respondent accepted to vary the impugned award and he has awarded
				<lb />
				only 40% of the fee alongwith 6% simple interest. Accordingly, learned
				<lb />
				Single Judge modified the award. The Award was accordingly made rule
				<lb />
				of the Court as modified. This decision was challenged before the Division
				<lb />
				Bench and it is in this context , the Division Bench referred to G.T. Gajria&apos;s
				<lb />
				Law Relating to Building and Engineering Contracts in India, came to a
				<lb />
				conclusion that an appropriate method was followed by the arbitrator and
				<lb />
				the learned Single Judge while coming to the conclusion that the
				<lb />
				respondent was entitled to the compensation of fee, which would have
				<lb />
				been paid had he performed his functions and more particularly the
				<lb />
				respondent had accepted the cut that is 40% of the fee payable. The facts
				<lb />
				are completely in variance to the facts in hand.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(iii) &quot;Goel Associates Vs. Shama Cooperative Group Housing Society&quot; 26 is
				<lb />
				also a case under the 1940 Act where the learned Single Judge was
				<lb />
				dealing with an application under Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration
				<lb />
				Act,1940. A claim was made by the petitioner for a compensation for his
				<lb />
				right being violated by the respondent under the contract. The Court
				<lb />
				referring to the general principles of award of damages when the breach
				<lb />
				of contract is proved, thought it appropriate to confirm the award. The
				<lb />
				principles as discussed in the judgment are well settled that in actions for
				<lb />
				breach of contract, the object is to put the plaintiff in the position he
				<lb />
				would have been in if the contract had been satisfactorily performed.
				<lb />
				However, in the facts of the present case, the judgment is squarely not
				<lb />
				applicable.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(iv) The Supreme Court in &quot;A.T. Brij Paul Singh And Ors. vs State Of
				<lb />
				Gujarat&quot; 27 has observed that when a contractor submits his tender for a
				<lb />
				works contract, a reasonable expectation of profit, is implicit in it and its
				<lb />
				loss has to be compensated by way of damages if the other party to the
				<lb />
				contract is guilty of breach of contract. It was observed that when a party
				<lb />
				entrusted with the work commits breach of the contract, the contractor
				<lb />
				would be entitled to the damages for loss of profit which he expected to
				<lb />
				earn by undertaking works contract. It was observed that what would be
				<lb />
				the measure of profit however would be depend upon the facts and
				<lb />
				circumstances of each case. In the said case the respondent was guilty of
				<lb />
				breach of contract as it was held that the recission of contract by the
				<lb />
				respondent was unjustified, and the contractor had executed a part of the
				<lb />
				works contract, and hence the contractor would be entitled to damages by
				<lb />
				way of loss of profit. Surely the desion would not forward the case of the
				<lb />
				Respondent.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(v) The decision of the Supreme Court in M/s.MSK Projects India (JV)
				<lb />
				Ltd. vs.State of Rajasthan &amp; Anr. 28 also discusses and recognizes the
				<lb />
				principles of damages when a claim is made by a contractor. The dispute
				<lb />
				between the parties pertained in the context of a contract awarded by the
				<lb />
				PWD, State of Rajasthan to the appellant to construct the Bharatpur bye-
				<lb />
				pass for the road from Bharatpur to Mathura. Concession agreement was
				<lb />
				entered into between the parties authorising collection of toll fee by the
				<lb />
				appellant-MSK. The period of concession was 111 months including the
				<lb />
				period of construction. The appellant had completed the contract work
				<lb />
				and also started collection of toll fee. However, there was some issue in
				<lb />
				collection of toll because of local agitation and consequently the
				<lb />
				respondent issued an order prohibiting entry of commercial vehicles into
				<lb />
				Bharatpur town and diverting traffic through the bye-pass and collection
				<lb />
				of toll from vehicles using Bharatpur-Deeg patch of the road. The disputes
				<lb />
				were referred to arbitration. The arbitral award was made in favour of the
				<lb />
				appellant in which a finding was recorded that there was a delay on the
				<lb />
				part of the respondent in issuing a notification that the State has failed to
				<lb />
				implement the same and the contractor was entitled to collect toll fee even
				<lb />
				from the vehicles using Bharatpur-Deeg part of the road. The respondent
				<lb />
				was directed to pay a sum of Rs.990.52 lacs to MSK-appellant as loss for
				<lb />
				the period in question. A challenge to the award by the respondent-State
				<lb />
				of Rajasthan before the learned District Judge succeeded and the arbitral
				<lb />
				award was set aside. In an appeal before the High Court, the dcision and
				<lb />
				findings of the learned District Judge stood confirmed. It is in this context
				<lb />
				the Supreme Court was discussing the law on damages and also referring
				<lb />
				the decision in A.T. Brij Paul Singh And Ors. vs State Of Gujarat (supra)
				<lb />
				redirected adjudication on the point as framed in paragraph 50 of the
				<lb />
				judgment. However, in reaching to the conclusion some important
				<lb />
				observations as made by the Supreme Court are relevant in the context of
				<lb />
				the present proceedings which are required to be noted, which in fact
				<lb />
				support the case of the Petitioner which is also a public authority. The
				<lb />
				Supreme Court in paragraph 47 observed that, it is strange that a person
				<lb />
				who has not complied with terms of contract and has acted in
				<lb />
				contravention of the terms of agreement claims that he was entitled to
				<lb />
				earn more profit. It was observed that the respondent was not permitted
				<lb />
				to claim damages on compensation as he has not spent the said amount. It
				<lb />
				was also observed that the reliefs which are claimed by the appellant
				<lb />
				would prove to be a &quot;windfall profit&quot; without carrying out the obligation to
				<lb />
				execute the work just on technicalities. In paragraphs 47 and 49, the Court
				<lb />
				observed thus:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;47. It is strange that a person who has not complied with terms of
				<lb />
				contract and has acted in contravention of the terms of agreement
				<lb />
				claims that he was entitled to earn more profit. The private
				<lb />
				appellant cannot be permitted to claim damages/compensation in
				<lb />
				respect of the amount of Rs.13.25 crores, as he did not spend the
				<lb />
				said amount stipulated in the terms of agreement. The private
				<lb />
				appellant cannot claim the amount of Rs. 7.13 crores for a period of
				<lb />
				three years for a small patch of 1.25 kilometers out of the total
				<lb />
				length of the road to the extent of 10.85 kilometers.
				<lb />
				... ... ...
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				49. The State authority had decided to establish a toll road as it was
				<lb />
				not having sufficient funds. In case the claim of the private
				<lb />
				appellant is allowed and as the State is not in a position to grant
				<lb />
				further facility to collect the toll fee at such a belated stage, the
				<lb />
				purpose of establishing the toll road itself stands frustrated. More
				<lb />
				so, the toll fee cannot be collected to recover the amount never
				<lb />
				spent by the contractor. It is evident from the discourse in pre-bid
				<lb />
				meetings of the parties that it had been decided that compensation
				<lb />
				would be worked out on the basis of investment made by contractor
				<lb />
				concerned. More so, the statutory notification dated 10.2.1997
				<lb />
				provided to recover the cost of construction and maintenance
				<lb />
				including interest thereon. Therefore, the question of non-execution
				<lb />
				of work of second phase of the contract becomes very material and
				<lb />
				relevant to determine the real controversy. The State authorities for
				<lb />
				the reasons best known to them, did not make reference to the
				<lb />
				arbitration proceedings for non-execution of the work of the second
				<lb />
				phase of the contract. However, the relief claimed by the private
				<lb />
				appellant would prove to be a &quot;windfall profit&quot; without carrying out
				<lb />
				the obligation to execute the work just on technicalities. We have
				<lb />
				held in this very case, that the arbitrator cannot proceed beyond the
				<lb />
				terms of reference and, therefore, the question of considering the
				<lb />
				non-execution of work of the second phase of the work was neither
				<lb />
				permissible nor possible as it had arisen subsequent to the date of
				<lb />
				award in the arbitration proceedings.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				120.
				<lb />
				As a sequel to the above discussion in my opinion looked from
				<lb />
				any angle the arbitral tribunal could not have awarded in favour of the
				<lb />
				respondent damages of Rs. 86.72 crores for the alleged wrongful
				<lb />
				termination of the contract and the consequential award of interest in the
				<lb />
				said amount.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				121.
				<lb />
				Before concluding, I may observe that I have thought it
				<lb />
				appropriate to refer and discuss only the relevant decisions as cited on
				<lb />
				behalf of the parties. In regard to the other decisions, the principles of law
				<lb />
				as contained therein as arising in the facts of those cases are well settled. I
				<lb />
				have thought it appropriate not to burden the judgment by discussing
				<lb />
				those decisions as it would be wholly academic.
				<lb />
				CONCLUSION
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				122.
				<lb />
				The above deliberation on each of the issues touching the
				<lb />
				legality of the award leaves no room for any doubt that the arbitral award
				<lb />
				does not take into consideration the evidence on record and/or the
				<lb />
				findings are based on no evidence. This apart there is a perverse
				<lb />
				interpretation of the contractual terms, leading to a patent absurdity on
				<lb />
				the face of the record. There are also internal contradictions in the arbitral
				<lb />
				award coupled with findings being arrived on no evidence. When so
				<lb />
				many assailing factors are apparent on the face of the record, they would
				<lb />
				point out to only one conclusion that the arbitral award is wholly vitiated
				<lb />
				and unsustainable on the ground of perversity and patent illegality as
				<lb />
				available under Section 34 of the ACA. Consequently, the impugned
				<lb />
				award would also be required to be held as contrary to public policy. The
				<lb />
				principles of law to set aside an arbitral award on these grounds are also
				<lb />
				required to be noted.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				123.
				<lb />
				In McDermott International Inc. versus Burn Standard Co.
				<lb />
				Ltd. 29 the Supreme Court in paragraph 65 of the report has emphasized as
				<lb />
				to what is the supervisory jurisdiction in regard to judicial review of an
				<lb />
				arbitral award. The reasons being vitiated by perversity in evidence in
				<lb />
				contract and existence of internal contradictions are held to be grounds
				<lb />
				which would appreciate the award. The Supreme Court observed thus:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;65.
				<lb />
				We may consider the submissions of the learned counsel for
				<lb />
				the parties on the basis of the broad principles which may be attracted
				<lb />
				in the instant case i.e. (i) whether the award is contrary to the terms of
				<lb />
				the contract and, therefore, no arbitrable dispute arose between the
				<lb />
				parties;
			</item>
			<p>
				(ii) whether the award is in any way violative of the public
				<lb />
				policy; (iii) whether the award is contrary to the substantive law in
				<lb />
				India viz. Sections 55 and 73 of the Indian Contract Ac; (iv) whether
				<lb />
				the reasons are vitiated by perversity in evidence in contract; (v)
				<lb />
				whether adjudication of a claim has been made in respect whereof
				<lb />
				there was no dispute or difference; or (vi) whether the award is
				<lb />
				vitiated by internal contradictions.&quot;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				124.
				<lb />
				In Associates Builders Vs. Delhi Development Authority 30 the
				<lb />
				Supreme Court has explained the principles interalia on the fundamental
				<lb />
				policy of Indian law and patent illegality being the grounds available for
				<lb />
				setting aside the arbiral award which includes the juristic principle that a
				<lb />
				a decision which is perverse or so irrational that no reasonable person
				<lb />
				would arrive at would include within its ambit a finding based on no
				<lb />
				evidence or an arbitral tribunal taking into account something irrelevant
				<lb />
				to the decision which it arrives at; or ignores vital evidence in arriving at
				<lb />
				its decision. It is held that if the arbitral award contains any of these
				<lb />
				elements then the arbitral award would be required to be held being
				<lb />
				contrary to the fundamental principles which form part of the
				<lb />
				fundamental policy of Indian Law. In regard to the test of patent illegality
				<lb />
				of an arbitral award, the arbitral tribunal adjudicating a dispute in
				<lb />
				contravention of Section 28(3) of ACA, would amount to award being
				<lb />
				vitiated by patent illegality, apart from other grounds under this head
				<lb />
				namely the award in contravention of substantive law in India and
				<lb />
				illegality going to the root of the matter.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				125.
				<lb />
				In a recent decision in Ssangyong Engineering &amp; Construction
				<lb />
				Co.Ltd. Vs. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) 31 the Supreme
				<lb />
				Court has now held that a decision which is perverse, as understood in
				<lb />
				paragraphs 31 and 32 of Associate Builders (supra), while no longer being
				<lb />
				a ground for challenge under &quot;public policy of India&quot;, would certainly
				<lb />
				amount to a patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. It is held
				<lb />
				that a finding based on no evidence at all or an award which ignores vital
				<lb />
				evidence in arriving at its decision would be perverse and liable to be set
				<lb />
				aside on the ground of patent illegality. Also a finding based on documents
				<lb />
				taken behind the back of the parties by the arbitrator would also qualify as
				<lb />
				a decision based on no evidence inasmuch as such decision is not based on
				<lb />
				evidence led by the parties, and therefore, would also have to be
				<lb />
				characterised as perverse. The Court held thus:-
				<lb />
				&quot;37. Thus, it is clear that public policy of India is now constricted to
				<lb />
				mean firstly, that a domestic award is contrary to the fundamental
				<lb />
				policy of Indian law, as understood in paragraphs 18 and 27 of
				<lb />
				Associate Builders (supra), or secondly, that such award is against
				<lb />
				basic notions of justice or morality as understood in paragraphs 36
				<lb />
				to 39 of Associate Builders (supra). Explanation 2 to Section 34(2)
				<lb />
				(b)(ii) and Explanation 2 to Section 48(2)(b)(ii) was added by the
				<lb />
				Amendment Act only so that Western Geco (supra), as understood
				<lb />
				in Associate Builders (supra), and paragraphs 28 and 29 in
				<lb />
				particular, is now done away with.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				38. Insofar as domestic awards made in India are concerned, an
				<lb />
				additional ground is now available under sub-section (2A), added
				<lb />
				by the Amendment Act, 2015, to Section 34. Here, there must be
				<lb />
				patent illegality appearing on the face of the award, which refers to
				<lb />
				such illegality as goes to the root of the matter but which does not
				<lb />
				amount to mere erroneous application of the law. In short, what is
				<lb />
				not subsumed within &quot;the fundamental policy of Indian law&quot;,
				<lb />
				namely, the contravention of a statute not linked to public policy or
				<lb />
				public interest, cannot be brought in by the backdoor when it comes
				<lb />
				to setting aside an award on the ground of patent illegality.
				<lb />
				...... ... .... ...
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				41. The change made in Section 28(3) by the Amendment Act really
				<lb />
				follows what is stated in paragraphs 42.3 to 45 in Associate Builders
				<lb />
				(supra), namely, that the construction of the terms of a contract is
				<lb />
				primarily for an arbitrator to decide, unless the arbitrator construes
				<lb />
				the contract in a manner that no fair-minded or reasonable person
				<lb />
				pvr
				<lb />
				would; in short, that the arbitrator&apos;s view is not even a possible
				<lb />
				view to take. Also, if the arbitrator wanders outside the contract and
				<lb />
				deals with matters not allotted to him, he commits an error of
				<lb />
				jurisdiction. This ground of challenge will now fall within the new
				<lb />
				ground added under Section 34(2A).
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				42. What is important to note is that a decision which is perverse, as
				<lb />
				understood in paragraphs 31 and 32 of Associate Builders (supra),
				<lb />
				while no longer being a ground for challenge under &quot;public policy
				<lb />
				of India&quot;, would certainly amount to a patent illegality appearing on
				<lb />
				the face of the award. Thus, a finding based on no evidence at all or
				<lb />
				an award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision
				<lb />
				would be perverse and liable to be set aside on the ground of patent
				<lb />
				illegality. Additionally, a finding based on documents taken behind
				<lb />
				the back of the parties by the arbitrator would also qualify as a
				<lb />
				decision based on no evidence inasmuch as such decision is not
				<lb />
				based on evidence led by the parties, and therefore, would also
				<lb />
				have to be characterised as perverse.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				126.
				<lb />
				For the above reasons the petition needs to succeed. It is
				<lb />
				accordingly allowed by setting aside the impugned arbitral award dated
				<lb />
				15 February 2018. No cost.
