			<p>savudu and jelly and supplying the same, to the building contractors and<lb/> individual public, depending upon their requirements. As far as sand is<lb/> concerned, since 01.10.2003, quarrying operation is done by Public Works<lb/> Department, since 01.10.2003, onwards, pursuant to the introduction of<lb/> Section 38-A of the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959. As<lb/> per the statutory provisions, Public Works Department is quarrying and<lb/> selling sand, at the pits mouth, by collecting the sale amount and each<lb/> lorry is permitted to take two units load of sand. According to the<lb/> petitioner, the sale price includes, value of sand, quarrying cost, loading<lb/> charges and seiniorage fee.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> It is the case of the petitioner that the 5 th respondent, along<lb/> with many others, claiming themselves to be the dealers of the sand, set<lb/> up stockyards, by purchasing the river sand from Public Works<lb/> Department and selling the same, at a higher rate to lorry owners, like<lb/> the members of the Association.<lb/> According to the petitioner&apos;s<lb/> association, at private stockyards, one unit load of sand is being sold at<lb/> Rs.2,500/-and when it reaches the consumer, it is costly.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.<lb/> The petitioner&apos;s Association has further submitted that in<lb/> order to regulate sand trade, State Government have introduced Rule 38-<lb/>C in G.O.Ms.No.32, Industries (MMC02) Department, dated 10.02.2011,<lb/> which mandates that the dealers should obtain a licence from the<lb/> competent authority, for setting up stockyards. When the same was<lb/> challenged by several dealers in W.P.Nos.14180 of 2011, etc., batch, the<lb/> Hon&apos;ble Division Bench, by order, dated 19.06.2012, has upheld the<lb/> validity of the said Rule. However, during the pendency of the writ<lb/> petitions, the dealers have set up stockyards and were selling sand, on<lb/> the strength of interim orders. Though some of the dealers have<lb/> approached the Apex Court, there is no interim stay.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.<lb/> The petitioner&apos;s Association has further contended that the<lb/> main object of bringing about an amendment is to avoid illicit quarrying,<lb/> transportation of sand, and also to avoid sale of sand, at escalated rates.<lb/> According to the petitioner, they could not purchase sand directly from<lb/> Public Works Department, at Pits Mouths of the quarry sites and that<lb/> they are constrained to purchase sand only from the 5 th respondent.<lb/> Hence, the petitioner&apos;s Association has made a representation to the<lb/> District Collectors, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur, to take action against<lb/> the 5 th respondent, who has been selling sand, at an exorbitant rate, and<lb/> who has monopolized the trade, by storing sand, at various places,<lb/> without valid licences. Till the date of filing of the writ petition, no<lb/> action has been taken on the said representation. Hence, the present<lb/> writ petition has been filed for the relief, stated supra.<lb/></p>

			<p>6.<lb/> The Government have issued G.O.Ms.No.32, Industries<lb/> (MMC2) Department dated 11.02.2011, introducing Rule 38-C, by which,<lb/> it has been made mandatory that a dealer in sand has to obtain a licence<lb/> for setting up of a stockyard. The Rule also mandates that a sale slip,<lb/> shall be obtained by the stockist from the local Deputy Tahsildar. For the<lb/> said purpose, the stockist or the licensee shall send the original transport<lb/> permits, issued by the authorities, while transporting the mineral, from<lb/> the quarry sites. The sale slips have to be counter-signed by the Deputy<lb/> Tahsildar. The said rule has been challenged in a batch of writ petitions<lb/> in W.P.Nos.14180 of 2011, etc., [M.Palanisamy v. The State of Tamil<lb/> Nadu], wherein, it was contended that the transport permits or the sale<lb/> bills issued by the PWD is pertaining to the sale and transport of a<lb/> particular quantity of mineral and the said mineral, after being<lb/> transported to the stockyard will get merged with the stock, already<lb/> existing in the stockyard or with the sand, subsequently purchased by the<lb/> stockist from Public Works Department. Therefore, it is practically<lb/> impossible to identify the quantity of the sand which relates to a<lb/> particular transport permit, from the huge stock lying, at the stockyard<lb/> and that too, after processing the same. Since, the processing procedure<lb/> eliminates 25% of the purchased sand, the actual quantity available in<lb/> the stockyard, cannot tally with the sale bills issued by Public Works<lb/> Department. It is stated that the conditions imposed by way of impugned<lb/> Government Order, are totally without jurisdiction, per se illegal and<lb/> without any authority of law. According to the petitioners therein, the<lb/> conditions imposed violated the provisions contained under Article 14 &amp;<lb/> 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India and that they are against the law<lb/> laid down, by the Supreme Court and the High Court.<lb/></p>

			<p>7.<lb/> Among other contentions made by the Government of Tamil<lb/> Nadu, in the batch of writ petitions, to sustain Rule 38-C, the Joint<lb/> Secretary to the Government, Industries Department, Government of<lb/> Tamil Nadu, in his counter affidavit, has stated as follows:<lb/> &quot;35. It is to be noted that the then Joint Secretary<lb/> to the Government, Industries Department, Government<lb/> of Tamil Nadu, in his affidavit, stated that though the<lb/> Public Works Department has been quarrying sand in the<lb/> entire State, the Government has received reports of<lb/> illicit quarrying and transportation of sand by<lb/> unscrupulous elements. In order to curtail such activities<lb/> of illicit quarrying in the State of Tamil Nadu, the<lb/> offence of sand quarrying has been brought within the<lb/> purview of the Tamil Nadu Prevention of Dangerous<lb/> Activities of Bootleggers, Drug-Offenders, Forest-<lb/>Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders, Sand<lb/> Offenders, Slum-Grabbers and Video Pirates Act, 1982.<lb/> In order to strengthen the regulation of mineral<lb/> administration, the Government has included the<lb/> officials of the Police Department, not below the rank of<lb/> Inspector of Police, to exercise the power contained in<lb/> sub-section (4) of Section 21 of the Act.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>8.<lb/> The Principal Secretary to the Government, Industries<lb/> Department, in his affidavit, has stated that in exercise of such a power<lb/> under the amended Rules, illegal mining of sand and smuggling to<lb/> neighbouring States has been brought under control to a great extent.<lb/> He has further stated that over a period of one year, 4173 cases of illegal<lb/> sand mining have been filed, 5033 persons have been arrested, 5501<lb/> vehicles have been seized and dozens of persons have been taken into<lb/> preventive custody and that a sum of Rs.14 Crores, has been collected as<lb/> penalty, from such offenders.<lb/></p>

			<p>9.<lb/> In M.Palanisamy&apos;s case (cited supra), after considering the<lb/> rival contentions and the competence of the Government to frame the<lb/> rules, from prevention of illegal mining, transportation and storing of<lb/> materials, The Hon&apos;ble Division Bench of this Court, by order, dated<lb/> 19.06.2012, held as follows:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;we are of the definite opinion that the statutory<lb/> duty imposed upon the sand dealers under Rule 38-C of<lb/> the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959, for<lb/> the purpose of preventing illegal mining, storage and<lb/> transportation of sand, cannot be held as illegal,<lb/> arbitrary, ultra vires the Constitutional provisions or<lb/> any of the provisions of the Act. We hold that Rule 38-<lb/>C of the said Rules is fully in conformity with the<lb/> provisions of the Act and the Rules, and it cannot be held<lb/> as an excessive exercise of power by the State<lb/> Government.&quot;<lb/> (emphasis supplied)<lb/></item>

The interim orders have been vacated. The<lb/> contentions of the petitioners in the above writ petitions, as regards the<lb/> practical difficulty expressed and extracted above, have been negatived.<lb/></item>

			<item>When such is the case, it is not known, as to how the Mines, Revenue and<lb/> Police Authorities, have allowed the 5 th respondent to sell sand from the<lb/> places, where is no licence to possess, store, sell and transport sand,<lb/> with the bills, issued after the dismissal of the writ petitions. It is<lb/> apparent that the sand sold from the above places, have been permitted<lb/> to be transported by the authorities.<lb/></item>

			<p>11. Material on record discloses that on the representation of<lb/> the Secretary of the petitioner&apos;s Association, dated 07.11.2012, the<lb/> Executive Engineer, WRD, Kothasthalaiyaru Basin Division, Thiruvallur<lb/> District, in his proceedings, dated 27.12.2012, addressed to the<lb/> Executive Engineer, Lower Palar Basin Division, Kancheepuram and the<lb/> Executive Engineer, WRD, Araniyar Basin Division, Chepauk, Chennai, has<lb/> stated that since lower Palar Basin Division, Kancheepuram, falls with<lb/> the jurisdiction of the Executive Engineer, Lower Palar Basin Division,<lb/> Kancheepuram Kancheepuram District and since Gurupuram Village,<lb/> Uthukottai Taluk, Tiruvallur, falls within the jurisdiction of Executive<lb/> Engineer, WRD, Araniyar Basin Division, Chepauk, Chennai, he has<lb/> requested that action has to be taken on the representation of the<lb/> petitioner&apos;s Association, dated 07.11.2012. Along with the letter, dated<lb/> 27.12.2012, the representation of the petitioner&apos;s Association has been<lb/> enclosed.<lb/></p>

			<p>12. Record of proceedings shows that when the present Writ<lb/> Petition came up on 03.09.2013, the learned Additional Government<lb/> Pleader has been directed to take notice, on behalf of the official<lb/> respondents and get instructions. Thereafter, a Counter Affidavit, dated<lb/> 05.06.2013, has been filed by Mr.L.Sitherasenan, I.A.S., District<lb/> Collector, Kancheepuram, wherein, he has stated that pursuant to an<lb/> order, dated 26.07.2002, made in a public interest litigation, directing<lb/> the State Government to constitute a Committee of Experts to study<lb/> river and river beds in the State, with reference to sand quarrying and<lb/> the further direction, directing the State Government to act in<lb/> conformity with the guidelines to take all necessary further steps, to<lb/> arrest the exploitation, the Government have introduced Rule 38-A in<lb/> Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959, vide G.O(Ms)No.95<lb/> Industries (MMC.l) Department, dated 01.10.2003, thereby, the right to<lb/> exploit sand in the State, shall vest with the State Government, to the<lb/> exclusion of others and the Government have entrusted quarrying and<lb/> sale of sand to the Public Works Department vide G.O(Ms).No.451 Public<lb/> Works Department (WSpl-1) Department, dated 03.10.2003.<lb/></p>

			<p>13. It is further stated in the Counter Affidavit that the<lb/> Government in G.O(Ms)No.451 Public Works Department, (W.Special-1)<lb/> Department, dated 03.10.2003, have issued orders directing the Regional<lb/> Chief Engineers, WRO Public Works Department to directly operate sand<lb/> quarrying at 239 locations, identified by the respective Chief Engineers<lb/> to be stored at 95 depots and sold to the users, at a price of Rs.1,000/-<lb/>for lorry loads (2 units). Subsequently, in G.O.(Ms) No.178 Public Works<lb/> (MI-2) Department, dated 31.05.2008, the cost of the sand has been<lb/> reduced to Rs.600/-(2 units) and that the vehicles are permitted to carry<lb/> 3 units, subject to the condition, stipulated in the Motor Vehicles Act,<lb/> 1988. Subsequently due to the reduction of the flow of adequate sand to<lb/> the public, for construction works and increase in the cost of sand, due<lb/> to scarcity, in order to reduce the hardship to the public, supply of<lb/> adequate sand, through fair price was considered and after examination,<lb/> the Government have ordered that the Public Works Department have to<lb/> send the proposals to the respective District Collectors and obtain the<lb/> approval for opening of new sand quarries vide G.O.(Ms) No.110,-Public<lb/> works (MI2) Department, dated 06.07.2006.<lb/></p>

			<p>14. The District Collector, Kancheepuram, has further stated<lb/> that though Public Works Department has been quarrying sand in the<lb/> entire State, time and again, the Government have received reports, on<lb/> illicit quarrying and transportation of sand, by unscrupulous elements. In<lb/> order to curtail such activities of illicit quarrying etc., by Act No. 16 of<lb/> 2006, the Government of Tamil Nadu have included sand offenders within<lb/> the preview of Tamil Nadu Prevention of Dangerous Activity of<lb/> Bootleggers, Drug Offenders, Forest Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic<lb/> Offenders Slum-grabbers and Video Piracy Act, 1982. He has further<lb/> stated that in order to strengthen the regulation of mineral<lb/> administration, the Government have included personnel of the police<lb/> department, not below the rank of Inspector of Police, so as to enable<lb/> them to exercise the provisions of sub section (4) of section 21 of the<lb/> Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (Central Act<lb/> 67 of 1957) vide G.O.(Ms)No.ll4 Industries (MMC-1) Department, dated,<lb/> 18.09.2006.<lb/></p>

			<p>15. At Paragraph No.16 of the counter affidavit, the District<lb/> Collector has further submitted that there were many sand quarries<lb/> opened in Kancheepuram District in Palar river bed. Due to objection by<lb/> the public and on the Public Interest Litigation Petitions filed by the<lb/> Villagers before this Court, in respect of Kavanthandalam, Pichavadi<lb/> Pazhaveri and Neyyadupakkam village, etc., in W.P.Nos.22999 of 2009,<lb/> 28552 of 2011 and 27347 of 2012, quarry operations in the sand quarry<lb/> outlets, have been stopped. The Public Works Department is selling the<lb/> sand through the sale outlets, to the consumers, builders and others on<lb/> payment of Rs.626/-only per two units of lorry loads, on receipt of<lb/> demand drafts. The Public Works Department is issuing transport<lb/> permits, duly quoting the destination. Public Works Department is not<lb/> selling sand to the 5 th respondent, as alleged by the petitioner. On<lb/> receipt of the demand draft from the consumers, in their individual<lb/> names, Transport permits are issued in the form prescribed, duly noting<lb/> the departure, arrival, destinations. The owners or drivers of the<lb/> vehicles are getting sand from Public Works department outlets and<lb/> no individual is selling sand, as alleged by the petitioner.<lb/></p>

			<p>16. The District Collector, Kancheepuram, at Paragraph 19 of<lb/> the counter affidavit, has further stated that there is no stock yard<lb/> maintained by the fifth respondent and that the contention that the<lb/> fifth respondent and his men alone are permitted to purchase the<lb/> sand from Public Works Department outlets, is incorrect. He has<lb/> further stated that vehicles coming to the sale point, are being issued<lb/> with transport permits, on payment of the costs, prescribed by the<lb/> Government and none of the consumers/lorry drivers are denied issuance<lb/> of transport permits. Sand is being sold, as per the rate prescribed by<lb/> the Government from time to time and that there is no stock yard in<lb/> the vicinity of the PWD outlets.<lb/></p>

			<p>17. The District Collector, Kancheepuram, at Paragraph 21 of<lb/> his counter affidavit, has further stated that the fifth respondent has<lb/> not established any stockyard on his own. The fifth respondent has<lb/> applied for the grant of license for 7 places in Kancheepuram District.<lb/> Action has been taken to curb the illegal quarrying activities by<lb/> deploying Task Force comprising of Police, Revenue, Mines and<lb/> Regional Transport officers and those who are indulging illicit<lb/> transport of mineral are being intercepted and imposed penalty, and<lb/> criminal action is taken, wherever necessary. Further, at Paragraph<lb/> 22 of the counter affidavit, the District Collector has stated that there<lb/> is no stockyard maintained by the 5 th respondent and the 5 th<lb/> respondent has applied for licence, for setting up stockyards and the<lb/> applications are under progress. Counter affidavit has been signed on<lb/> 05 th June&apos; 2013. Thus, it could be deduced from the counter affidavit of<lb/> the District Collector, Kancheepuram, no licence has been granted by<lb/> him, for storage of sand, till 5 th June, 2013.<lb/></p>

			<p>18.

			<p>33. Photographs produced before this Court by the learned<lb/> Additional Government Pleader, along with the report of the Assistant<lb/> Director, Geology and Mining, Kancheepuram District, clearly shows that<lb/> the sand stored at the places, inspected by the Assistant Director of<lb/> Geology and Mining, Kancheepuram, looks like mountains. It is shocking<lb/> to the conscience of this Court, as to how Mr.L.Sitherasenan, District<lb/> Collector, Kancheepuram, has filed an affidavit, before this Court, as if,<lb/> there is no stockyard maintained by the fifth respondent in<lb/> Kancheepuram District. The Photographs produced by the petitioner on<lb/> 04.09.2013, before this Court, are as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>34. When the Assistant Director, Geology and Mining,<lb/> Kancheepuram District, has submitted a report to this Court, stating that<lb/> a huge quantity of sand is heaped at two different villages, viz.,<lb/> Palayaseevaram Village, Kancheepuram Taluk and Kallapiranpuram<lb/> Village, Madurantakam Taluk, both places falling within Kancheepuram<lb/> District, the District Collector, Kancheepuram, has filed an affidavit on<lb/> oath and stated that no stockyard is maintained by the 5 th respondent. If<lb/> no stockyard is maintained by the 5 th respondent, at the abovesaid survey<lb/> numbers and no licence is granted to the 5 th respondent, as per the<lb/> Tamilnadu Prevention of illegal mining, Transportation and Storage of<lb/> Minerals and Mineral Dealers&apos; Rules, 2011, it is not known, as to how,<lb/> about 79895 Cubic Metre (13316 lorry loads) were allowed to be stored<lb/> and transported from S.Nos.455/3, 455/4, 455/6, 455/8, 455/9 and<lb/> 455/10, Palayaseevaram Village, Kancheepuram Taluk. So also, the<lb/> quantity of sand stored in Kallapiranpuram Village, Madurantakam Taluk,<lb/> Kancheepuram District, is alarming. It is stated by the Assistant<lb/> Director, Geology and Mining, Kancheepuram District, 184737 Cubic<lb/> Metre (30790 lorry loads) is stocked in the said Village. Again, it is not<lb/> known as to how, such a large quantity of sand has been allowed to be<lb/> stored and transported from the said Village. Though Mr.Iyathurai,<lb/> Assistant Director of Geology and Mining, Kancheepuram, who is present<lb/> in the Court, has stated that vehicles transporting sand have been seized<lb/> and action has been taken, as per the Tamilnadu Prevention of illegal<lb/> mining, Transportation and Storage of Minerals and Mineral Dealers&apos;<lb/> Rules, 2011, he is not in a position to explain, as to how, such a<lb/> mountain like sand, has been allowed to be stored in the abovesaid<lb/> Villages, without any licence from the competent authority. He has<lb/> confirmed that the photographs produced before this Court along with<lb/> his report, dated 13.09.2013, pertain to the abovesaid Villages.<lb/></p>

			<p>35. When the District Collector, Kancheepuram, Kancheepuram<lb/> District, at Paragraph 16 of the counter affidavit, dated 05.06.2013, has<lb/> categorically admitted that Public Works Department is not selling sand<lb/> to the 5 th respondent and no licence has been given to the 5 th respondent<lb/> to store and sell sand, it is not known, as to how, the 5 th respondent or<lb/> other persons, involved in such illegal activity of storing and transporting<lb/> such a huge quantity of sand have been permitted by the District<lb/> Collector, Kancheepuram and his subordinates. Possession, storage and<lb/> transportation of such huge quantity of sand from the abovesaid places,<lb/> is apparent and can be seen from naked eyes.<lb/></p>

			<p>36. From the bundle of facts and the materials on record, it is<lb/> apparent that the Officials, right from Village Administrative officer,<lb/> Revenue Inspector, Tahsildar and other officials of the Mines and<lb/> Minerals Department, Police, Public Works Department and including the<lb/> District Collector, Kancheepuram, have not taken any action the<lb/> concerned person or persons, who has/have illegal stockyards at<lb/> S.Nos.455/3, 455/4, 455/6, 455/8, 455/9 and 455/10, Palayaseevaram<lb/> Village, Kancheepuram Taluk and S.Nos.37/3A, 65/2, 65/3, 66/2A1, etc.,<lb/> at Kallapiranpuram Village, Madurantakam Taluk. Such a huge heaps of<lb/> sand at the abovesaid two different places, cannot be stored in a single<lb/> day. The illegal activity should be for a long period. The total number<lb/> of loads of sand, as per the report of the Assistant Director, Geology and<lb/> Mining, Kancheepuram, from the abovesaid Villages, in Kancheepuram<lb/> District, works out to 2,64,632 Cubic Metre (44,106 lorry loads).<lb/></p>

			<p>37. When the matter came up on 16.09.2013, the Assistant<lb/> Director, Geology and Mining, Kancheepuram, has stated that<lb/> Mr.L.Sitherasenan is functioning as District Collector, Kancheepuram, for<lb/> nearly two years. The Assistant Director, Mines and Minerals,<lb/> Kancheepuram, has further stated that earlier, he was functioning in the<lb/> same capacity in Tiruvallur District and now for the past four months, he<lb/> is working as Assistant Director, Geoloy and Mining, Kancheepuram<lb/> District.<lb/></p>

			<p>38. From the perusal of the bills, enclosed in the typed set of<lb/> papers, filed by the petitioner, it could be deduced that even after the<lb/> dismissal of the writ petitions filed by the petitioner herein in<lb/> W.P.Nos.14180 of 2011, etc., [M.Palanisamy v. The State of Tamil<lb/> Nadu], sand is being sold from the Survey numbers, mentioned therein.<lb/> Though Mr.L.Sitherasenan, I.A.S., is functioning as District Collector,<lb/> Kancheepuram, for nearly two years and Mr.Iyyathurai, is functioning as<lb/> Assistant Director of Mines, Kancheepuram, for nearly four months, no<lb/> details have been submitted to prove that the abovesaid authority or any<lb/> other competent authority under the Mines and Minerals (Development<lb/> and Regulation) Act, 1957 and the Tamilnadu Prevention of illegal<lb/> mining, Transportation and Storage of Minerals and Mineral Dealers&apos;<lb/> Rules, 2011, have taken any action against such huge storage, sale and<lb/> transportation of the sand, from the abovesaid survey numbers in<lb/> Palayaseevaram Village, Kancheepuram Taluk and Kallapiranpuram<lb/> Village, Madurantakam Taluk, both falling within the Kancheepuram<lb/> District, even though no licence has been granted by the District<lb/> Collector, Kancheepuram.<lb/></p>

			<p>39. The batch of Writ Petitions in M.Palanisamy v. The State of<lb/> Tamil Nadu reported in 2012 (4) CTC 1, have been disposed of on<lb/> 19.06.2012 and interim orders have been vacated.<lb/> The invoices,<lb/> annexed in the typed set of papers, makes it clear that the 5 th<lb/> respondent has issued Invoices-Cash Bill/Way Bill, stating that he has<lb/> branch offices, at various survey numbers and the numbers of the writ<lb/> petitions have also been given. Though the abovesaid invoices disclose<lb/> various survey numbers, the petitioner has not enclosed any bill in the<lb/> typed of papers, pertaining to S.Nos.37/3A, 65/2, 65/3, 66/2A1, etc., at<lb/> Kallapiranpuram Village, Madurantakam Taluk, which is now inspected by<lb/> the Assistant Director of Geology and Mining, Kancheepuram District,<lb/> where, 9 heaps of sand have been stocked in patta lands in S.Nos.455/3,<lb/> 455/4, 455/6, 455/8, 455/9 and 455/10, Palayaseevaram Village,<lb/> Kancheepuram Taluk. The sand stocked in the area has been measured<lb/> and quantity assessed to 79895 Cubic Metre (13316 lorry loads). Even<lb/> the Assistant Director of Geology and Mining, Kancheepuram, has not<lb/> given full survey numbers in his report and in that, he has merely<lb/> stated as &quot;etc.,&quot;. The other survey numbers are not given.<lb/></p>

			<p>40. When this Court, vide order, dated 10.09.2013, has directed<lb/> the District Collector, Kancheepuram District, to produce the relevant<lb/> details, as to how much quantity of sand has been purchased by the 5 th<lb/> respondent, every month, and the number of lorries employed by the 5 th<lb/> respondent, the District Collector has clearly stated that no sand has<lb/> been sold to the 5 th respondent. As regards the existence of two illegal<lb/> stockyards in Kancheepuram District, &quot;to dump a pumpkin in a morsel of<lb/> food&quot;, the District Collector has stated that no stockyard is maintained<lb/> by the 5 th respondent. When the bills disclose storage and sale from<lb/> Survey Nos.455/3,455/4, 455/6, 455/8, 455/9, 455/10, 456/2B,<lb/> Palayaseevaram Village, Kancheepuram Taluk &amp; District, by the 5 th<lb/> respondent, the District Collector, Kancheepuram, feigning total<lb/> ignorance, of storage of such huge quantities of sand, has denied even<lb/> the existence of any stockyard in the abovesaid Survey Numbers,<lb/> contrary to the truth, proof of physical examination and production of<lb/> documentary evidence, including photographs, by the Assistant Director<lb/> of Geology and Mining, Kancheepuram.<lb/></p>

			<p>41. Though the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer of Tiruvallur<lb/> District, has been directed to produce sales tax returns of the 5 th<lb/> respondent, for the periods between 2011-12 and 2012-13, he has not<lb/> produced the same. The District Collector, Tiruvallur, has not produced<lb/> the details of the sales effected to the 5 th respondent and others, for the<lb/> period between 2011-12 and 2012-13, as directed by this Court. The<lb/> Executive Engineer, PWD/WRD., Araniyar Basin Division, Chepauk,<lb/> Chennai, has stated that only 5839 loads of sand, has been sold from the<lb/> four quarries, viz., Vadathillai (S.F.No.174), Malanthur (S.F.Nos.82 &amp; 84),<lb/> Rallapadi (S.F.No.1/1) and 43. Panapakkam (S.F.No.105), in Tiruvallur<lb/> District.<lb/></p>

			<p>42. Though the District Collector, Tiruvallur District, in his<lb/> counter affidavit, has stated that licence has been granted for storage<lb/> and transportation of sand from patta land in Survey Nos.40/1A, 1B, 1C,<lb/> 2, 41/1B, 1C, 2, 51/1, 2A and 51/2C, he has not furnished any<lb/> comparative statement of the details of the sand purchased by the 5 th<lb/> respondent and others, the extent of sand, stocked, sold and transported<lb/> from the abovesaid survey Numbers, for which, licence has been granted.<lb/></p>

			<p>43. As per Section 4(2)(1-A) of the Mines and Minerals<lb/> (Development and Regulation) Act, no person shall transport or store or<lb/> cause to be transported or stored any mineral otherwise than in<lb/> accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules made<lb/> thereunder.<lb/></p>

			<p>(3) The amount of compensation payable under sub-<lb/>section (2) shall be determined by the State Government in<lb/> the manner prescribed&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>45. Though the District Collector, Kancheepuram, in his counter<lb/> affidavit, dated 05.06.2013, has categorically averred that no sand has<lb/> been sold to the 5 th respondent and further stated that no licence has<lb/> been issued to the 5 th respondent to set up a stockyard in Kancheepuram<lb/> District, Officers of the Public Works Department, the Revenue and<lb/> Mining Authorities have conspicuously failed to discharge their duties and<lb/> allowed the 5 th respondent and others, to store, sell and transport sand,<lb/> at the places mentioned in the Invoices, annexed in the typed set of<lb/> papers, even after the dismissal of the writ petitions in M.Palanisamy v.<lb/> The State of Tamil Nadu reported in 2012 (4) CTC 1. From the above,<lb/> it could be deduced that large scale irregularities have been committed<lb/> in the matter of procurement, storage and transportation of sand, inspite<lb/> of the orders of the Hon&apos;ble Division Bench and statutory provisions. The<lb/> contentions of the District Collector, Kancheepuram, that action has<lb/> been taken to curb illicit mining, storage and transport of sand is a farce<lb/> and it does not reflect the correct picture. Unless there is an active<lb/> support and collusion of some of the officers, belonging to Public Works<lb/> Department, Revenue, Mining and other authorities, or with the external<lb/> support of others, such huge heaps of sand cannot be stored in a short<lb/> span of time. This Court is of the view that large scale irregularities and<lb/> offences have been committed, punishable under law and insofar as<lb/> these stockyards are concerned, the offenders have been allowed, Scot-<lb/>free. Two I.A.S., Officers and other officers, at the level of Assistant<lb/> Director of Geology and Mining and the officials of Public Works<lb/> Department, are primarily responsible for not enforcing the provisions of<lb/> the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 and the<lb/> Tamilnadu Prevention of illegal mining, Transportation and Storage of<lb/> Minerals and Mineral Dealers&apos; Rules, 2011.<lb/></p>

			<p>46. On this day, when the matter came up for hearing, learned<lb/> Additional Government Pleader submitted an action taken report of the<lb/> District Collector, Kancheepuram and it reads as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;The inspection made by the Assistant Director (Mines)<lb/> on 13.09.2013 and it is found that there are unauthorised<lb/> sand stockyard noticed in patta lands in S.Nos.455/3, 455/4,<lb/> 455/6, 455/8, 455/9, 455/10, Pazhiyasivaram Village,<lb/> Kancheepuram Taluk and in S.Nos.37/3A, 65/2, 65/3,<lb/> 66/2A1, etc., Kallapiranpuram Village in Maduranthagam<lb/> Taluk. Immediately, I directed the authorities to seize the<lb/> unauthorised stocking of sand in the abovesaid premises and<lb/> taken custody of the District Administration.<lb/> I also instructed concern official to take appropriate<lb/> action against the persons operated the sand stockyard under<lb/> the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959.<lb/> Further, I have instructed all the official to verify the<lb/> unauthorised sand stockyard noticed, if any, in their<lb/> jurisdiction and take appropriate action in accordance with<lb/> the provisions and the relevant rules.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>47. The action now taken by the District Collector<lb/> Kancheepuram, on 17.09.2013, only fortifies the view of this Court that<lb/> what is stated at various paragraphs in the counter affidavit filed by<lb/> Mr.L.Sitherasenan, the District Collector, Kancheepuram, dated<lb/> 05.06.2013, that there is no stockyard maintained by the 5 th respondent,<lb/> is a false statement.<lb/></p>

			<p>48. Statutory provisions from the Tamilnadu Prevention of illegal<lb/> mining, Transportation and Storage of Minerals and Mineral Dealers&apos;<lb/> Rules, 2011, have already been extracted. Violation of these rules is<lb/> apparent. Gross failure on the part of the officers, lend support to the<lb/> irregularities. Perpetuation with their support, by their inaction is writ<lb/> large. As per the conditions of stockyard licence, the licencee shall<lb/> submit a monthly return, as in appendix XXII to the District Collector,<lb/> before 10 th of Succeeding month. Whenever any person stocks stand or<lb/> transports or causes to be transported the sand, without any lawful<lb/> authority and for that purpose, any tool, equipment, vehicle or any other<lb/> thing, shall be liable to be seized by the competent authorities and shall<lb/> also be liable for confiscation of the same. Only permitted quantity shall<lb/> be stored, if excess is found, action will be taken, as per rule. They<lb/> should maintain register for quantity of sand purchased and quantity of<lb/> sand sale at stockyard.<lb/> Sand purchased from the Public Works<lb/> Department authority, can only be stored at the stockyard. Quantity of<lb/> sand purchased and quantity of sand sold should be maintained in the<lb/> registers and the same may be produced to the concerned officials at the<lb/> time of inspection. No sand shall be stocked other than the licence<lb/> granted area. Documentary evidence/proof should be submitted to the<lb/> officials of the Public Works Department, at the time of verification.<lb/> Statutory provisions from the Tamilnadu Prevention of illegal mining,<lb/> Transportation and Storage of Minerals and Mineral Dealers&apos; Rules, 2011,<lb/> have already been extracted.<lb/></p>

			<p>49. From the materials on record, it could be deduced that the<lb/> officials of the Revenue Districts, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur Districts,<lb/> Public Works Department and the Police, who is now entrusted with the<lb/> power to enforce the provisions of Sections 4(1-A) and 21 of the Mines<lb/> and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 and who are duty<lb/> bound to exercise proper administrative control to prevent any<lb/> contravention of the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development<lb/> and Regulation) Act, 1957 and the Rules framed thereunder, particularly,<lb/> Tamilnadu Prevention of illegal mining, Transportation and Storage of<lb/> Minerals and Mineral Dealers&apos; Rules, 2011, take appropriate action, if<lb/> there is any violation or contravention, have remained silent and in a<lb/> way responsible for the illegalities and irregularities, now stated to have<lb/> been noticed by them, for the first time, after the directions issued by<lb/> this Court on 04.09.2013. They have not only failed to meet the<lb/> expected standards of performance of their duties and their inaction, in<lb/> the opinion of this Court, is not short of dereliction of their duties or<lb/> abetting the crime. Their omission to prevent storage, sale from the<lb/> unlicensed stockyards diminishes the confidence, which the law, has<lb/> reposed on them. The report of the Assistant Director of Geology and<lb/> Mines, Kancheepuram, the action now taken<lb/> by<lb/> the<lb/> District<lb/> Collector, Kancheepuram, to effect seizure of the place and the ocular<lb/> evidence, available on the face of record, makes it clear that something<lb/> grave has been shielded by many persons.<lb/></p>

			<p>50. This Court takes it for granted that neither the State or the<lb/> Central Government, would contend that if any authority, who is the<lb/> empowered to inspect, search and strictly enforce the mining and the<lb/> environmental laws, to preserve and conserve the natural resources,<lb/> failed to do so, causing huge loss to the Government, they should be<lb/> allowed to go scot-free. Offences under the Mining laws are offences<lb/> against the State and unless a specialised agency conducts a thorough<lb/> investigation, as to whether, who are all the persons involved in the<lb/> illegal activities, persons, who are shielding the offenders, the network<lb/> and the illegalities and irregularities are bound to continue. It is the<lb/> duty of the Constitutional Court to ensure that minerals should not be<lb/> illegally exported. If such heaps of sand are to be stored at two different<lb/> villages, either the person in possession and enjoyment of the properties,<lb/> where the sand is stocked should have quarried the mineral from some<lb/> place or places or transported sand from one district to another. It<lb/> should be borne in mind that after 2003, the State has taken over the<lb/> quarrying activity. Therefore, the State and the District Administration,<lb/> particularly, the Collectors of Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram, Public Works<lb/> Department and others, are bound to explain, as to why, they have not<lb/> taken action, so far. What prevented them from enforcing the penal<lb/> laws. While considering the issue, as to whether, any independent<lb/> external agency, has to conduct an impartial and fair investigation, this<lb/> Court has taken cognizance of the conduct of the Collector,<lb/> Kancheepuram District, set out supra, the conduct of the Commercial<lb/> Tax Officer, in not producing the returns submitted by the 5 th<lb/> respondent, the public accountability of the District Collectors of<lb/> Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur Districts, Public Works Department and<lb/> other officials, under the provisions of the Mines and Minerals<lb/> (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, and the Rules framed<lb/> thereunder, in particular, to the enforcement of the Tamilnadu<lb/> Prevention of illegal mining, Transportation and Storage of Minerals and<lb/> Mineral Dealers&apos; Rules, 2011, the Hon&apos;ble Division Bench judment in<lb/> M.Palanisamy v. The State of Tamil Nadu reported in 2012 (4) CTC 1,<lb/> the mandate of the Constitutional Court, to enforce the above mining<lb/> and environmental laws and to protect the revenue of the Government,<lb/> deems it fit, to order for an investigation, by an external agency.<lb/></p>

			<p>51. Notwithstanding the action taken by the District Collector,<lb/> Kancheepuram, this Court is of the view that a thorough investigation has<lb/> to be conducted. Having regard to the entirety of the facts, stated<lb/> supra, this Court directs Central Beurau of Investigation, Government of<lb/> India, New Delhi, to nominate an Officer, in the rank of an Inspector<lb/> General of Police, to conduct a fair and proper investigation into,<lb/> (i) As to whether the 5 th respondent or any other person, in charge<lb/> in S.Nos.455/3, 455/4, 455/6, 455/8, 455/9, 455/10,<lb/> Pazhiyasivaram Village, Kancheepuram Taluk and in S.Nos.37/3A,<lb/> 65/2, 65/3, 66/2A1, etc., Kallapiranpuram Village in<lb/> Maduranthagam Taluk, has illegally quarried sand from the quarry<lb/> sites in Tamil Nadu.<lb/></p>
