			<lb />
			This is a case of a sizable chunk of State Government&apos;s
			<lb />
			land, abutting the sea situated at Mahim within the Mahim Bay at
			<lb />
			Mumbai, occupied by slums. The Government however is nowhere in
			<lb />
			the scene, either to remove the slums or to rehabilitate the slum
			<lb />
			dwellers. Eventually the slum dwellers stepping into the shoes of their
			<lb />
			sentinel, decided to redevelop this land by appointing a developer in
			<lb />
			2006. Thereafter, it has been rounds and rounds of litigation before
			<lb />
			different forums and twice before this Court. The reason being obvious,
			<lb />
			there being two groups of slum dwellers and two rival developers,
			<lb />
			having strong commercial interest considering the nature of the land
			<lb />
			and probably its proximity to the sea. The Government as also the
			<lb />
			different authorities under it, in the scheme of things, seem to be silent
			<lb />
			spectators, to the happenings between the slum dwellers and different
			<lb />
			developers. It is a sorry state of affairs for the slum dwellers, when their
			<lb />
			genuine interest stand superseded by extraneous interest.
			<lb />
			It, however, needs to be acknowledged that the ingenuity of the
			<lb />
			parties and prolixity has sprouted some legal issues, a legal appetite at
			<lb />
			the bar and surely in the circumstances, not a very heartening task for
			<lb />
			the Court, albeit the erudition and scholarship at the bar in arguing
			<lb />
			these issues.
			<lb />
			Challenge
			<lb />
			2.
			<lb />
			These are two petitions filed under Article 226 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution of India. Writ Petition no.2349 of 2018 is filed by New
			<lb />
			Janta SRA CHS Ltd. challenging two orders, first impugned order
			<lb />
			being an order dated 17 May 2016 passed by the Chief Executive
			<lb />
			Officer, Slum Rehabilitation Authority (for short &apos;the CEO-SRA&apos;)
			<lb />
			rejecting its application for change of developer made under Section
			<lb />
			13(2) of the Maharahstra Slum Areas (Improvement, Clearance and
			<lb />
			Redevelopment) Act, 1971 (for short &apos;the Slums Act&apos;). This order of the
			<lb />
			CEO-SRA was challenged by the petitioner before the Apex Grievances
			<lb />
			Redressal Committee, constituted under the Slums Act (for short &apos;the
			<lb />
			AGRC&quot;). By the second impugned order dated 11 January 2018, the
			<lb />
			AGRC has confirmed the order passed by the CEO SRA rejecting the
			<lb />
			petitioner&apos;s application no.110 of 2016 as also dismissed petitioner&apos;s
			<lb />
			another application whereby the petitioner had inter-alia prayed that
			<lb />
			the Letter of Intent (for short &apos;the LOI&apos;) issued by the Slum
			<lb />
			Rehabilitation Authority (for short &apos;the SRA&apos;) in favour of respondent
			<lb />
			no.5-Shree Nidhi Concept Relators Pvt. Ltd., as the developer for the
			<lb />
			slums scheme, be set aside.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3.
			<lb />
			The second petition (Writ Petition no.2285 of 2018) is filed
			<lb />
			by M/s.SLK Buildcon Pvt.Ltd., the new developer who was appointed
			<lb />
			by the petitioner-New Janta, to replace Respondent No. 5, who has also
			<lb />
			challenged the said impugned orders of the CEO-SRA and the orders as
			<lb />
			passed by the AGRC, as challenged in the first petition. The challenge
			<lb />
			in both these proceedings being common, these petitions were heard
			<lb />
			together and are being decided by this common judgment.
			<lb />
			Petitioner&apos;s Case
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			The factual antecedents giving rise to the dispute between
			<lb />
			the parties as contended by the petitioner are required to be noted. For
			<lb />
			convenience, reference is made to the facts, on record of the petition
			<lb />
			filed by New Janta SRA Co-op. Housing Society Ltd (proposed). The
			<lb />
			parties are referred as arrayed in the said writ petition.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			The petitioner-New Janta SRA Co-op. Housing Society Ltd
			<lb />
			(proposed) is a society formed by the slum dwellers on the land in
			<lb />
			question. Respondent no. 5-Shree Nidhi Concept Relators Pvt. Ltd is
			<lb />
			company incorporated under the Companies Act 1956, and was
			<lb />
			appointed by the petitioner as a developer to undertake the slum
			<lb />
			rehabilitation scheme, for the petitioner. Respondent No. 7 is-SLK
			<lb />
			Buildcon Pvt Ltd who is sought to be appointed by the petitioner to
			<lb />
			replace respondent no. 5. Respondent no 8 and 9 are also proposed co-
			<lb />
			operative societies of the slum dwellers on the adjoining lands and who
			<lb />
			have joined the petitioner to form a composite slum rehabilitation
			<lb />
			scheme.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			The controversy in the present proceedings concerns the
			<lb />
			redevelopment of slums as per Regulation 33(10) of the Development
			<lb />
			Control Regulations for Greater Bombay (for short &apos;DCR 33(10)&apos;)
			<lb />
			framed under the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act, 1966, on
			<lb />
			land belonging to the Government of Maharashtra (Collector&apos;s land)
			<lb />
			being Plot bearing C.S.no.1500(Pt), 2116(Pt) and 2124 (Pt) in
			<lb />
			aggregate admeasuring about 20465.72 sq.meters. which was notified
			<lb />
			as slums under Section 4 of the Slums Act and occupied by about 1263
			<lb />
			slum dwellers. The slum dwellers on these plots have formed three
			<lb />
			societies namely the petitioner -New Janta SRA CHS Ltd., respondent
			<lb />
			no.8-Nav Kiran CHS and respondent no.9 -Hind Ekta CHS.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			These societies passed separate resolutions in June 2006 in
			<lb />
			their respective General Body Meetings appointing respondent no.5-
			<lb />
			Nidhi Concept Realtors Pvt. Ltd. as a developer and respondent no.6-
			<lb />
			Ms.Sheetal Nikhare, as the architect to undertake and implement a
			<lb />
			slum rehabilitation scheme (for short &apos;a Slum Scheme&apos;). This slum
			<lb />
			scheme concerns a larger land involving all the said three societies. The
			<lb />
			slum scheme was to be initially undertaken on C.S.No.1500 (Pt)
			<lb />
			admeasuring about 6876.26 sq. meters as per the provisions of DCR
			<lb />
			33(10).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			In pursuance of the said General Body Resolutions, these
			<lb />
			societies entered into separate development agreements dated 17
			<lb />
			October 2006 with respondent no.5 as also executed necessary power
			<lb />
			of attorney in favour of respondent no.5 to undertake the slums
			<lb />
			scheme.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			Respondent no.5 through respondent no.6 on 27 August
			<lb />
			2008 submitted a proposal with the SRA to implement a composite
			<lb />
			scheme under DCR 33(10) for the said three societies on plot
			<lb />
			C.S.No.1500 (Pt).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			10.
			<lb />
			In December 2009 a revised proposal was submitted by
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 by amalgamation of the area of C.S.no.2124 (pt) and
			<lb />
			2116 (pt) admeasuring about 13478.32 sq.meters, in the slum scheme
			<lb />
			submitted on 27 August 2008 (aggregating to about 21354.58 Square
			<lb />
			meters (referred to as &apos;larger land&apos;). The petitioner contends that
			<lb />
			respondent nos.5 and 6, however, did not take any further steps for the
			<lb />
			next several years, not even for the purpose of verification of eligible
			<lb />
			and non-eligible slum dwellers. The petitioner has contended that after
			<lb />
			about four years of the appointment of respondent nos.5 and 6, on 8
			<lb />
			June 2010 the Deputy Collector and the Competent Authority, issued a
			<lb />
			certified Annexure II for a total of 1263 slum dwellers in the three
			<lb />
			societies, out of which 804 slum dwellers were found to be eligible
			<lb />
			slum dwellers. The details of which are as under:-

			<lb />
			It is the petitioners&apos; case that after the issuance of
			<lb />
			Annexure II in June 2010, till April 2014 no concrete steps were taken
			<lb />
			by respondent no.5 for implementation of the slum rehabilitation
			<lb />
			scheme on the larger land, creating a belief in the slum societies that
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 lacks capability to implement the slum scheme on the
			<lb />
			larger land. The petitioner has contended that to misguide all
			<lb />
			stakeholders, respondent no.5 however, furnished an undertaking
			<lb />
			dated 10 April 2014 to the petitioner that it would obtain a &apos;Letter of
			<lb />
			Intent&apos; (LOI) to implement the slum scheme latest by 30 June 2014 and
			<lb />
			in the event, it fails to do so, it would resign as a developer and would
			<lb />
			withdraw from the subject scheme.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			12.
			<lb />
			The petitioner however on 15 June 2014 passed a
			<lb />
			resolution in its general body meeting removing respondent no.5 as
			<lb />
			developer, for the reason that since its appointment in 2006 respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 has caused an inordinate delay to implement the slum scheme, on
			<lb />
			the larger land, despite an undertaking furnished by respondent no.5
			<lb />
			on 10 April 2014 that a LOI would be obtained by 30 June 2014. In
			<lb />
			the said general body meeting the petitioner decided to appoint SLK-
			<lb />
			Buildcon Private Limited-respondent no.7 (petitioner in the companion
			<lb />
			petition) as a new developer to undertake implementation of the slum
			<lb />
			scheme. The petitioner also entered into a development agreement
			<lb />
			with the new developer and executed a power of attorney in its favour.
			<lb />
			Respondent no.5 was accordingly informed of the said decision. By
			<lb />
			petitioner&apos;s letter dated 27 June 2014 the decision of the petitioner
			<lb />
			removing respondent no.5 and appointing respondent no.7, was also
			<lb />
			communicated to the CEO SRA, with a request to remove respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 as a developer of the society. The petitioner has contended that
			<lb />
			the petitioner&apos;s decision dated 15 June 2014 removing respondent no.5
			<lb />
			and 6 as the developer was not challenged by respondent nos.5 and 6
			<lb />
			before any authority at any time and thus has attained finality.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			13.
			<lb />
			The petitioner contends that, the other two societies, also
			<lb />
			passed general body resolutions on 19 May 2014 and 22 June 2014
			<lb />
			terminating the appointment of respondent no.5 as a developer.
			<lb />
			However, this was not accepted by respondent nos.8 and 9 who has
			<lb />
			stated that it was only one faction of the slum dwellers, who passed
			<lb />
			such a resolution and that respondent no.8 and 9 are supporting re-
			<lb />
			development by respondent no.5.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			14.
			<lb />
			The petitioner has stated that respondent no.5 despite
			<lb />
			being aware of its removal on 6 June 2014, nonetheless submitted an
			<lb />
			application with the SRA for issuance of a Letter of Intent (LOI),
			<lb />
			necessary to implement the slum scheme. It is stated that this was done
			<lb />
			on false documents showing the support of the societies and that in fact
			<lb />
			it was a fraud played by respondent no.5.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			15.
			<lb />
			The CEO-SRA, on 11 July 2014 made an endorsement on
			<lb />
			the first draft-report for issuance of an LOI directing the Assistant
			<lb />
			Registrar of the Co-operative Societies to hold general body meeting of
			<lb />
			the society to ascertain whether respondent no.5 had continuous
			<lb />
			consent of more than 70% of the eligible slum dwellers or otherwise.
			<lb />
			The Assistant Registrar accordingly by his communication dated 15 July
			<lb />
			2014 directed the Societies to call for a General Body Meeting of all the
			<lb />
			eligible slum dwellers, to elect the Chief Promoter and the Managing
			<lb />
			Committee members and to consider whether respondent no.5 had the
			<lb />
			consent of more than 70% of the eligible slum dwellers.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16.
			<lb />
			Some of the slum dwellers being aggrieved by the said
			<lb />
			communication of the Assistant Registrar approached the Divisional
			<lb />
			Joint Registrar of Co-operative Societies, in a Revision Applications.
			<lb />
			These revisions were allowed by the Divisional Joint Registrar by an
			<lb />
			order dated 11 September 2014, who set aside the said communication
			<lb />
			dated 15 July 2014 of the Assistant Registrar.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			17.
			<lb />
			The petitioner and some of the members of the society
			<lb />
			being aggrieved by the order dated 11 September 2014 passed by the
			<lb />
			Divisional Joint Registrar, filed writ petitions before this Court. By an
			<lb />
			order dated 18 December 2014 passed in a batch of writ petitions (Writ
			<lb />
			Petition No.8412 of 2014 and others) the writ petitions were allowed,
			<lb />
			upholding the communication dated 15 July 2014 issued by the
			<lb />
			Assistant Registrar which was issued in pursuance of CEO-SRA&apos;s letter
			<lb />
			dated 11 July 2014.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			18.
			<lb />
			In pursuance to the orders of this Court, the Assistant
			<lb />
			Registrar issued a letter dated 13 January 2015 directing the petitioner
			<lb />
			to conduct a fresh general body meeting. Another letter dated 19
			<lb />
			January 2015 came to be issued by the Assistant Registrar informing
			<lb />
			the petitioner that the subject of the proposed general meeting would
			<lb />
			not be to change the developer, but after electing the Chief Promoter to
			<lb />
			ascertain if respondent no.5 had the support of more than 70% of the
			<lb />
			eligible slum dwellers. Further a letter dated 23 January 2015 was
			<lb />
			issued by the Assistant Registrar directing the petitioner to hold
			<lb />
			General Body meeting on 8 February 2015/9 February 2015 listing out
			<lb />
			the subjects to be placed before the General Body.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19.
			<lb />
			Respondent no.5 being aggrieved by the said direction of
			<lb />
			the Assistant Registrar to hold a general body meeting, as also some
			<lb />
			slum dwellers who also felt aggrieved by the said communication, filed
			<lb />
			applications before the High Power Committee (for short &apos;HPC&apos;) on
			<lb />
			January 2015 challenging not only the notice for holding general body
			<lb />
			meeting on 8 February 2015 but also challenged, the direction dated
			<lb />
			July 2014 of the CEO SRA to hold a general body meeting. In the said
			<lb />
			application respondent no.5 also prayed for directions to the CEO SRA
			<lb />
			to issue a Letter of Intent (LOI) in its favour.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			20.
			<lb />
			The HPC, on hearing the parties, by its order dated
			<lb />
			February 2015 allowed the application filed by respondent no.5, by
			<lb />
			setting aside the decision of the CEO-SRA, whereby the Assistant
			<lb />
			Registrar was called upon to hold a general body meeting of the
			<lb />
			petitioner to ascertain support of 70% slum dwellers to respondent
			<lb />
			no.5. The HPC held that there was no willful delay on the part of
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 and the LOI at the behest of respondent no.5 should
			<lb />
			be processed further.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			21.
			<lb />
			The petitioner being aggrieved by the above decision of the
			<lb />
			HPC filed Writ Petitions (WPL 673 of 2015 and WPL 674 of 2015)
			<lb />
			before this Court interalia contending that appointment of respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 as a developer, was unanimously terminated by the petitioner on
			<lb />
			15 June 2014 in its general body meeting. It was contended that it was
			<lb />
			also terminated by the other two societies for the reason of inordinate
			<lb />
			delay on the part of respondent nos.5 and 6 in undertaking the slum
			<lb />
			scheme and it was so intimated to the CEO-SRA. It was contended that
			<lb />
			out of 400 eligible slum dwellers more than 70% of the slum dwellers
			<lb />
			had submitted to the CEO-SRA duly sworn affidavits confirming the
			<lb />
			removal of respondent no.5 thereby withdrawing their consent to the
			<lb />
			appointment of respondent no.5. This Court by an order dated 21
			<lb />
			September 2015 dismissed the said writ petitions however, permitted
			<lb />
			the SRA to take a decision uninfluenced by any observations and
			<lb />
			conclusions in the impugned order of the HPC and the said orders
			<lb />
			passed by the High Court. In paragraph 30, 33, and 34 this Court
			<lb />
			observed thus:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;30. … …… It has also found that there is a procedure laid
			<lb />
			down for the change of developers under the slum
			<lb />
			rehabilitation scheme. Moreover the CEO could have taken
			<lb />
			action u/s. Maharashtra Slum Area Act,1971.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			33.
			<lb />
			We do not read Paragraphs 11 and 12 of the
			<lb />
			impugned order in the manner suggested by Mr.Dhakephalkar
			<lb />
			and Mr.Khambata. We do not think any mandate flows from the
			<lb />
			observations and findings of the HPC or that the SRA is
			<lb />
			therefore bound to issue the LOI. These observations must be
			<lb />
			read in context and if so read, we are of the opinion that they
			<lb />
			are made in the course of reminding the SRA about its duties
			<lb />
			and functions in law. Beyond that, the HPC has not done
			<lb />
			anything. In Paragraph 12 of the impugned order the HPC has
			<lb />
			reminded the SRA that the main object of implementation of
			<lb />
			Slum Rehabilitation Scheme is to uplift/improve the standard of
			<lb />
			living of the slum dwellers who are staying in slums for years
			<lb />
			together and if the proposal is delayed, the valuable rights of
			<lb />
			the slum dwellers for improvement of their dwelling conditions
			<lb />
			would be defeated and the very purpose of the Slums Act would
			<lb />
			fail and will be frustrated. We clarify that such observations will
			<lb />
			not bind the SRA when it is taking a decision on the application
			<lb />
			submitted by Respondent No.8. If the SRA is the final decision
			<lb />
			making authority and such power vests in its, then no court,
			<lb />
			tribunal or committee can control or regulate it. None can
			<lb />
			direct the SRA to take a particular decision in a particular
			<lb />
			manner. There is enough guidance for the SRA in provisions of
			<lb />
			Slums Act,Rules, DCR etc. Further the object and purpose of the
			<lb />
			Act is known to the SRA. Eventually, the decision is to be taken
			<lb />
			by its highest executive functionary. The SRA is the statutory
			<lb />
			authority and therefore, must take an independent decision
			<lb />
			uninfluenced by any observations made in any order. Therefore,
			<lb />
			the impartiality and independence is expected from it. In such a
			<lb />
			situation there is no basis for the apprehensions expressed by
			<lb />
			the learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioner&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			34.
			<lb />
			We accordingly hold that the SRA will take a
			<lb />
			decision uninfluenced by any observations and conclusions in
			<lb />
			the impugned order and including an order of this Court.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			22.
			<lb />
			Petitioner contends that by the above order of this Court
			<lb />
			all issues were left open to be decided by the CEO SRA. The petitioner
			<lb />
			thus contends that the said order did not conclude any issues on the
			<lb />
			inordinate delay on the part of respondent no.5 in implementing the
			<lb />
			slum scheme nor the said order concluded any issue on the consent of
			<lb />
			the 70% slum dwellers to the appointment of respondent no.5. It is
			<lb />
			stated that no issue in regard to the capability of respondent no.5 was
			<lb />
			gone into by the High Court in passing the said order and all these
			<lb />
			issues were left open to be decided by the SRA.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			23.
			<lb />
			In pursuance of the said order dated 20 September 2015
			<lb />
			passed by this Court, the petitioner moved an application dated 10
			<lb />
			October 2015 before the CEO-SRA under Section 13(2) of the Slums
			<lb />
			Act, interalia praying to terminate the appointment of respondent no.5,
			<lb />
			as the developer, owing to inordinate delay caused by respondent no.5
			<lb />
			in implementation of slums scheme on the larger land and praying that
			<lb />
			the application dated 6 June 2014 filed by respondent no.5 for issuance
			<lb />
			of LOI and for implementation of the slum scheme be rejected.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			24.
			<lb />
			The CEO SRA thereafter passed an order dated 17
			<lb />
			December 2015, thereby directing the Assistant Registrar to conduct a
			<lb />
			fresh election of all the three societies to elect the managing committee
			<lb />
			members and once the &quot;managing committees&quot; of these societies are
			<lb />
			elected, then such &quot;managing committees&quot; elected by the majority of
			<lb />
			the slum dwellers, will take appropriate decision in respect of the slum
			<lb />
			rehabilitation scheme.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			25.
			<lb />
			The CEO SRA also by his letter dated 29 September 2015
			<lb />
			informed the Principal Secretary, Housing Department, Government of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra that without holding fresh elections of these three
			<lb />
			societies, it was not possible to consider the prayers as made in the
			<lb />
			application for change of developer since there were rival factions
			<lb />
			within three societies and it was not clear which faction has majority
			<lb />
			support of the eligible slum dwellers. Petitioner has stated that
			<lb />
			although on one hand the CEO SRA initiated the process of conducting
			<lb />
			fresh elections to the Managing Committee by directing the Assistant
			<lb />
			Registrar, however, on the other hand the SRA arbitrarily issued a letter
			<lb />
			of intent dated 5 February 2016 in favour of respondent nos.5 and 6 as
			<lb />
			a developer and architect respectively to undertake slum
			<lb />
			redevelopment of the three societies. This was done without awaiting
			<lb />
			the outcome of the elections of the three societies. However, although
			<lb />
			the LOI was issued on 5 February 2016, it was specifically mentioned in
			<lb />
			the LOI as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;41. This LOI will have no bearing whatsoever on any parallel
			<lb />
			proceedings under any section of the Maharashtra Slum Areas (I.C.
			<lb />
			A &amp; D. R) Act, 1971&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			26.
			<lb />
			The petitioner contends that there was no legal bar for the
			<lb />
			CEO SRA, to take steps to decide petitioner&apos;s application dated 10
			<lb />
			October 2015 submitted under Section 13(2) of the Slums Act, as also
			<lb />
			for invalidating the LOI. It is contended that respondent no.5 also could
			<lb />
			not have claimed any equity on the ground of the LOI being issued
			<lb />
			and/or to assume a position that there was any approval of the SRA for
			<lb />
			continuation of respondent no.5 as a developer. Petitioner contends
			<lb />
			that anything done by respondent no.5 in pursuance of the LOI
			<lb />
			including making any expenditure on any count, could not have
			<lb />
			created any equities in favour of respondent no.5 as the LOI itself was
			<lb />
			conditional.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			27.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, between 17 th to 20 th March,2016 elections of
			<lb />
			the three societies were held in the presence of the Assistant Registrar,
			<lb />
			whereby the Chief Promoter of the three societies were elected.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			28.
			<lb />
			Consequent to the said elections, the petitioner again
			<lb />
			passed a resolution dated 26 March 2016 in its managing committee
			<lb />
			approving the general body resolution dated 15 June 2014 removing
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 as developer on the ground of inordinate delay on the
			<lb />
			part of respondent no.5 in implementing the slums scheme and/or
			<lb />
			inaction for past several years.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			29.
			<lb />
			In pursuance of the managing committee resolution, the
			<lb />
			petitioner moved another application dated 15 April 2016 with the
			<lb />
			CEO SRA under Section 13(2) of the Slums Act interalia praying for
			<lb />
			removal of respondent no.5 as developer and in the alternative for
			<lb />
			carving out petitioner&apos;s plot of land to be developed independently. This
			<lb />
			application of the petitioner was stated to be supported by the
			<lb />
			affidavits of 300 slum dwellers out of the total 400 slum dwellers. On
			<lb />
			5 May 2016 the CEO SRA heard all the parties on the petitioner&apos;s
			<lb />
			application under Section 13(2) and reserved orders.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			30.
			<lb />
			The CEO SRA by the first impugned order dated 17 May
			<lb />
			2016 dismissed the petitioner&apos;s application interalia holding that there
			<lb />
			was no willful delay on the part of respondent no.5. It was observed
			<lb />
			that the general body resolution of the Petitioner-society dated 15 June
			<lb />
			2014 terminating respondent no.5 as the developer was passed at the
			<lb />
			instance of the rival developer who wanted to take over the slum
			<lb />
			scheme so as to take benefit of the decision taken by the Maharashtra
			<lb />
			Coastal Zone Management Authority in its meeting dated 31 January
			<lb />
			2014 whereby the said authority held that land beyond 100 meters
			<lb />
			CRZ line from the high tide line of Mahim Bay and creek, will not fall
			<lb />
			under the ambit of CRZ notification of the year 2011. The petitioner
			<lb />
			has contended that the impugned order dated 17 May 2016 was passed
			<lb />
			by the CEO SRA also taking into consideration certain documents that
			<lb />
			were filed by respondent no.5 under the cover of its letter dated 8 May
			<lb />
			2016, after the hearing of the Section 13(2) application was closed by
			<lb />
			the Chief Executive Officer-SRA on 5 May 2016. It is stated that on 9
			<lb />
			May 2016 respondent no.5 surreptitiously placed on record the
			<lb />
			following documents:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;i.
			<lb />
			Letter dated 28 th July,2009 addressed by the Respondent

		<p>

			<lb />
			Copy of the minutes of the decision of the HPC dated
			<lb />
			05.03.2016.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			31.
			<lb />
			According to the petitioner these documents, as placed on
			<lb />
			record by respondent no.5 on 9 May 2016 are forged and fabricated
			<lb />
			and were submitted with malicious intention of falsely demonstrating
			<lb />
			before the SRA, that respondent no.5 has support of requisite number
			<lb />
			of slum dwellers. It is contended that these documents were never part
			<lb />
			of the record till 9 May 2016, also they were never referred during the
			<lb />
			oral arguments. It is contended that respondent no.5 had not given any
			<lb />
			justification for not producing the said documents in any of the earlier
			<lb />
			proceedings. It is contended that some persons shown to have signed
			<lb />
			the resolutions dated 3 May 2014, 4 May 2014 and 7 May 2014 have
			<lb />
			already expired. It is contended that this was more pertinent as this
			<lb />
			Court in its order dated 18 December 2014 passed in Writ Petition 8412
			<lb />
			of 2014 had observed that the development agreement with respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 was terminated by the petitioner as per resolution in the general
			<lb />
			body meeting dated 15 June 2014. It is contended that when it was so
			<lb />
			observed by the High Court respondent no.5 never felt need to refer to
			<lb />
			the existence of the said resolution dated 3 May 2014, 4 May 2014 and
			<lb />
			7 May 2014 before the High Court. It is contended that the purported
			<lb />
			general body meetings held on 3 May 2014, 4 May 2014, 7 May 2014
			<lb />
			were only attended by 550 members out of total strength of 1258
			<lb />
			members. Petitioner also contends that these resolutions have no
			<lb />
			sanctity inasmuch several persons signed twice and several persons
			<lb />
			whose names were present in certified annexure-II had put their
			<lb />
			signatures, for which there was no justification in facts and in law.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			32.
			<lb />
			On the above backdrop the petitioner being aggrieved by
			<lb />
			the order dated 17 May 2016 passed by the CEO SRA approached the
			<lb />
			AGRC in two separate applications (Application 83 of 2016 and
			<lb />
			application 110 of 2016). By application no.83 of 2016 the petitioner
			<lb />
			interalia prayed for quashing of LOI dated 5 February 2016 issued by
			<lb />
			the SRA in favour of respondent nos.5 and 6. By application no.110 of
			<lb />
			2016, the petitioner prayed for quashing of the order dated 17 May
			<lb />
			2016 passed by the CEO-SRA on the petitioner&apos;s application under
			<lb />
			Section 13(2) of the Slums Act.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			33.
			<lb />
			Also an additional affidavit dated 7 July 2016 was filed by
			<lb />
			the petitioner before the AGRC highlighting the illegalities of
			<lb />
			respondent no.5. The petitioner contends that during the pendency of
			<lb />
			the proceedings before the AGRC, the petitioner discovered some
			<lb />
			startling facts which showed respondent no 5, playing a fraud on the
			<lb />
			authorities, namely that respondent no.5, had in fact transferred its
			<lb />
			entire shareholding to one Omkar Realtors in the year 2015-16 without
			<lb />
			obtaining permission of the SRA. Petitioner contends that this was
			<lb />
			sufficient to render the LOI issued in favour of respondent no.5 to be
			<lb />
			non-est and void ab initio. It is submitted that transfer of shares was
			<lb />
			effected gradually and in the manner as set out in paragraph 28(w) of
			<lb />
			the petition, which reads thus:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;i.
			<lb />
			At the time of incorporation of Respondent No.5 in
			<lb />
			September,2006, the authorized share capital was Rs.1,00,000/-
			<lb />
			lakh divided into 10,000 shares held by Mohanlal Senghani and
			<lb />
			Chandulal Senghani (&quot;Senghanis&quot;)
			<lb />
			ii
			<lb />
			In 2008, the authorized share capital was increased to
			<lb />
			Rs.5,00,000/-.
			<lb />
			iii
			<lb />
			Mr.Paras Porwal was introduced as a shareholder with
			<lb />
			the increase in shareholding by 50,000 shares.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			iv
			<lb />
			The Senghanis sometime in March,2015 sold their entire
			<lb />
			shareholding in respondent No.5 to one Ronie Porwal.
			<lb />
			v
			<lb />
			On 25.01.2016 (around one week prior to issuance of
			<lb />
			the LOI on 05.02.2016) around 1,24,50,000/-shares of face
			<lb />
			value of Rs.12,45,00,000/-were issued to Omkar Realtors.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			vi.
			<lb />
			On 27.07.2016, another 51,00,000 shares of face value
			<lb />
			of Rs.5,10,00,000/-were issued to Omkar Realtor in
			<lb />
			Respondent No.5, thereby taking the shareholding of Omkar
			<lb />
			Realtor in Respondent no.5 to 99.44%.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			34.
			<lb />
			The petitioner contends that respondent no.5 thus not only
			<lb />
			assigned and transferred complete control of respondent no.5 to Omkar
			<lb />
			Realtors but effectively transferred the entire slum scheme to Omkar
			<lb />
			Realtors which was impermissible in law being in derogation of DCR
			<lb />
			33(10) read with Appendix IV. The petitioner in these circumstances
			<lb />
			filed an other affidavit dated 17 November 2016 before the AGRC
			<lb />
			bringing the facts to the notice of AGRC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			35.
			<lb />
			The AGRC hearing the parties on the said application filed
			<lb />
			by the petitioner and on all the issues so urged, by the second
			<lb />
			impugned order dated 11 January 2018, confirmed the orders passed
			<lb />
			by the Chief Executive Officer, SRA, dismissing both the said
			<lb />
			applications of the petitioner.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			36.
			<lb />
			The petitioner being aggrieved by the said order dated 17
			<lb />
			May 2015 passed by the Chief Executive Officer, SRA as confirmed by
			<lb />
			the AGRC by the impugned order dated 11 January 2018, has filed the
			<lb />
			present petition interalia praying for the following reliefs.
			<lb />

			As noted above, SLK Buildcon is also before the Court in the companion

			<lb />
			Case of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (Respondent Nos.2 to 4):-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			37.
			<lb />
			On behalf of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority
			<lb />
			(respondent nos.2 to 4), a reply affidavit of Mr.Padmakar Rokade,
			<lb />
			Deputy Collector is filed supporting the decision of the CEO-SRA as
			<lb />
			also the AGRC. The SRA has contended that it is a planning authority
			<lb />
			for implementation of slum rehabilitation project as established under
			<lb />
			the provisions of Chapter I-A of the Slums Act, constituted with aims,
			<lb />
			object and functions of implementing the slums rehabilitation schemes/
			<lb />
			projects in the Mumbai City and suburban district and to provide
			<lb />
			permanent alternate accommodation to the eligible slum dwellers free
			<lb />
			of cost and without consideration as per slum rehabilitation scheme. It
			<lb />
			is stated that the slum dwellers, residing on the plot of land in question
			<lb />
			admeasuring 7876 sq.meters had formed the said three societies as
			<lb />
			noted above, and these societies in their respective general body
			<lb />
			meeting held on 3 June 2006, 9 June 2006 and 15 June 2006 had
			<lb />
			appointed respondent no.5 as their developer for implementation of the
			<lb />
			slum scheme on the said land under the amended Development Control
			<lb />
			Regulation (DCR) 33(10). It is stated that the societies also executed
			<lb />
			respective development agreements, power of attorneys, and common
			<lb />
			as well as individual consents in favour of respondent no.5. That
			<lb />
			respondent no.6-architect had submitted a slum scheme proposal in
			<lb />
			respect of the subject property with the SRA which was complete in all
			<lb />
			respect, and was duly accepted by the office of SRA on 27 August 2008.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, as per the procedure a computerized number was issued
			<lb />
			and LOI scrutiny fee of Rs.5555/-was also paid. It is stated that on a
			<lb />
			representation dated 29 September 2008, of the architect-respondent
			<lb />
			no.6 as made on behalf of respondent no.5, the Government of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra/Revenue and Forest Department issued directions on 28
			<lb />
			July 2009 to the Collector, Mumbai City to carry out survey of the
			<lb />
			subject property and accordingly, after the survey of the subject
			<lb />
			property, C.S.Number was given to the subject property being
			<lb />
			C.S.No.2124(pt) which is situated between C.S.No.1500(pt) and
			<lb />
			C.S.No.2166(pt). It is submitted that after numbering of the property
			<lb />
			as C.S.no.2124(pt), the members of the said three societies held
			<lb />
			general body meetings on 23 August 2009 and resolved that the
			<lb />
			remaining 827 slum dwellers residing on the adjacent plot of land
			<lb />
			admeasuring 13478 sq.meters bearing C.S.No.2116(pt) and 2124(pt)
			<lb />
			shall also join the slum scheme alongwith the slum scheme earlier
			<lb />
			submitted on 27 August 2008 for 502 slum dwellers residing on the
			<lb />
			plot of land admeasuring 7876 sq.meters bearing C.S.no.1500 and
			<lb />
			thus, the slum scheme was submitted for larger portion of the subject
			<lb />
			property admeasuring about 21354 sq.meters collectively. It is stated
			<lb />
			that thereafter respondent no.6-architect and respondent no.5
			<lb />
			submitted a proposal for amalgamation of the land of the said three
			<lb />
			societies with additional slum dwellers. The total slum dwellers would
			<lb />
			be 480 slum dwellers of the petitioner, 211 slum dwellers of Nav Kiran
			<lb />
			SRA CHS (proposed) and 136 slum dwellers of Hind Ekta SRA CHS
			<lb />
			(proposed), including those residing on the adjacent plot of land
			<lb />
			bearing C.S.no.2166 (pt) which is contiguous to C.S.no.1500(pt). The
			<lb />
			earlier proposal was in respect of 502 slum dwellers. It is stated that
			<lb />
			the said proposal was submitted alongwith the revised draft Annexure-
			<lb />
			II and the revised slum plan. This proposal for amalgamation was
			<lb />
			accepted by the office of the SRA, since it was complete in all respect.
			<lb />
			Respondent no.5 also paid additional LOI scrutiny fees on 4 December
			<lb />
			2009.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			38.
			<lb />
			The SRA has stated that the Executive Engineer/SRA
			<lb />
			forwarded revised draft Annexure-II consisting of 1329 slum dwellers
			<lb />
			alongwith the revised slum plan to the Deputy Collector/SRA and who
			<lb />
			in turn by letter dated 4 February 2010 forwarded the same to the
			<lb />
			Additional Collector, Mumbai City. It is stated that the Additional
			<lb />
			Collector then forwarded the same to the Deputy Collector
			<lb />
			(Encroachment &amp; Rehabilitation) and the Competent Authority, Dharavi
			<lb />
			Division, Mumbai, since the subject land belonged to the State
			<lb />
			Government. It is stated thereafter the Deputy Collector and the
			<lb />
			Competent Authority on 8 June 2010 issued certified Annexure-II qua
			<lb />
			the three societies, artifying that there are 1263 slum dewellers and
			<lb />
			out of which 804 slum dwellers were declared as eligible for allotment
			<lb />
			of a permanent alternate accommodation. Also that out of said 804
			<lb />
			eligible slum dwellers 658 that is 82% gave their consents in favour of
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 to be the developer. It is stated that as per 669 slum
			<lb />
			dwellers were found residing on the property of New Janta SRA CHS
			<lb />
			(proposed) and out of which 400 were declared as eligible, while 294
			<lb />
			slum dwellers were found residing on the property of Nav Kiran SRA
			<lb />
			CHS (proposed) out of whom 204 were declared as eligible and in so
			<lb />
			far as respondent no.9-Hind Ekta SRA CHS (proposed) was concerned,
			<lb />
			300 slum dwellers were found residing there and out of which 200
			<lb />
			were declared as eligible. It is stated that as per the said certified
			<lb />
			Annexure-II the subject property/land was admeasuring 21315
			<lb />
			sq.meters as owned by the Government of Maharashtra and it is a
			<lb />
			censused slum.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			39.
			<lb />
			The SRA has stated that as per LOI report of the
			<lb />
			Engineering Department of SRA dated 4 July 2014, the area of the
			<lb />
			subject property was admeasuring 20465 sq.meters and was affected by
			<lb />
			major 60.8 wide D.P. Road, leaving area admeasuring 13338 sq.meters
			<lb />
			and after deducting the said D.P. Road area, the net plot area was
			<lb />
			admeasuring only 7126 sq.meters and out of which 30% of the plot is
			<lb />
			affected by Metro-III project and thus the actual plot area for
			<lb />
			implementation of slum scheme on the subject property was only 4988
			<lb />
			sq.meters and the subject property was also affected by CRZ and all
			<lb />
			these aspects were affecting the viability of the Slum scheme. It is
			<lb />
			stated that the LOI report also states that from Mahim to Dadar, coastal
			<lb />
			area has been declared as Bay and which was reducing the CRZ line
			<lb />
			from 500 meters to 100 meters. It was stated that the subject plot of
			<lb />
			land was expected to be free from CRZ line consequent to the order
			<lb />
			passed by this Court on 15 November 2013 in Writ Petition No.327 of
			<lb />
			2013 (Deepak Rao Vs. State of Maharashtra), in pursuance of which
			<lb />
			the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority passed a
			<lb />
			resolution in its meeting on 31 January 2014 that land beyond 100
			<lb />
			meters CRZ line on the high tide line of Mahim Bay and creek will not
			<lb />
			fall under the ambit of CRZ Notification of the year 2011. It is stated
			<lb />
			that considering all these aspects, the CEO-SRA in the impugned order
			<lb />
			dated 17 May 2016 passed on Section 13(2) application of the
			<lb />
			petitioner held that in view of the hurdles and due to the provisions of
			<lb />
			CRZ and reservation of D.P. Road and other various reservations on the
			<lb />
			subject property, delay has been caused in implementation of slum
			<lb />
			scheme on the subject property, and the delay cannot be attributed to
			<lb />
			the said developer. It is stated that the CEO-SRA therefore, rejected the
			<lb />
			application filed by the petitioner and other societies for termination of
			<lb />
			the appointment of respondent no.5 as developer. It is stated that CEO-
			<lb />
			SRA has rightly come to a conclusion that in the General Body meetings
			<lb />
			of the three societies of the slum dwellers held on 3 May 2014, 4 May
			<lb />
			2014 and 7 May 2014 respectively, the said societies reaffirmed the
			<lb />
			appointment of respondent no.5 as their developer. It is stated that the
			<lb />
			documents submitted by respondent no.5 were part of SRA records and
			<lb />
			therefore, there is no violation of principle of natural justice. Referring
			<lb />
			to the decision of the AGRC, it is stated that the AGRC followed
			<lb />
			principles of natural justice by granting an opportunity of hearing to
			<lb />
			the petitioner on all the documents. It is submitted that by following
			<lb />
			due process of law the SRA had issued a LOI pm 5 February 2016 in
			<lb />
			favour of and other necessary permissions like IOD (dated 28 June
			<lb />
			2016) and C.C. (dated 22 February 2018) for the Slum Scheme in
			<lb />
			question. It is stated that considering all these facts, the CEO-SRA
			<lb />
			passed an order dated 17 May 2016 rejecting the application filed by
			<lb />
			the petitioner and other societies under Section 13(2) to terminate the
			<lb />
			appointment of respondent no.5 as developer and declined to approve
			<lb />
			the appointment of respondent no.7 as new developer. It is stated that
			<lb />
			the order passed by the AGRC being a well reasoned order has
			<lb />
			appropriately confirmed the order passed by the CEO-SRA. It is stated
			<lb />
			that the AGRC has rightly considered the issue of transfer of shares in
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 and considering the provision of Sections 56 and 58 of
			<lb />
			the Companies Act, the AGRC is correct in coming to a conclusion that
			<lb />
			there is no bar for transfer of shares in a company incorporated under
			<lb />
			the Companies Act. It is stated that the office order dated 23 March
			<lb />
			2015 issued by the SRA, does not restrict transfer of shares in a
			<lb />
			company, as in case of such transfer, transfer fees are payable at the
			<lb />
			rate of 5% to the SRA by the Developer. It is stated that in the present
			<lb />
			case respondent no.5 has submitted all relevant documents showing
			<lb />
			the change of shareholding for the purpose of issuance of Annexure-III
			<lb />
			to the SRA and respondent no.5 continues to be on record of the SRA
			<lb />
			as the developer for implementation of Slum Rehabilitation Scheme on
			<lb />
			the subject property. It is stated that the transfer fee shall be recovered
			<lb />
			by SRA from respondent no.5 as per the SRA norms for transfer of
			<lb />
			shares. It is stated that considering concurrent findings of both the
			<lb />
			authorities below, the petition needs to be rejected and in the interest
			<lb />
			of slum dwellers who are awaiting for their permanent alternate
			<lb />
			accommodation under the Scheme since 2006. It is stated that even as
			<lb />
			per the record of SRA more than 50% of the slum dwellers have
			<lb />
			already vacated their respective tenements and shifted elsewhere by
			<lb />
			accepting rent in lieu of transit accommodation.
			<lb />
			Case of Respondent nos.5 and 6 (Shree Nidhi Concept Realtors Pvt.Ltd.):-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			40.
			<lb />
			On behalf of respondent no.5 a reply affidavit of Mr.Vijay
			<lb />
			Kunder, authorised signatory of respondent no.5 is placed on record.
			<lb />
			Respondent no.5 has contended that AGRC has taken into
			<lb />
			consideration all relevant facts right from appointment of respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 as developer in the year 2006. Paragraph 4 of the reply sets out
			<lb />
			complete sequence of events, contending that the AGRC has rightly
			<lb />
			upheld the order dated 17 May 2016 passed by the CEO-SRA.
			<lb />
			Respondent no.5 has stated that substantial progress is made by
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 towards expeditious implementation of the slum
			<lb />
			scheme and that an amount of Rs.36,17,79,000/-has already been
			<lb />
			expended on payment of rent for transit accommodation to the slum
			<lb />
			dwellers. It is contended that 393 slum dwellers forming part of the
			<lb />
			petitioner have also accepted rent for transit accommodation from
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 and the slum dwellers have also executed possession
			<lb />
			receipts in favour of respondent no.5, which would show that the slum
			<lb />
			dwellers of the petitioner society are not in favour of change of
			<lb />
			developer. Referring to the sanctioned layout plan dated 28 June 2016
			<lb />
			in regard to rehabilitation building, it is contended that respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 shall endeavour to complete construction of the rehabilitation
			<lb />
			building and put the eligible slum dwellers in possession of permanent
			<lb />
			alternate accommodation. In paragraph 7 it is stated that an amount of
			<lb />
			Rs.63,78,28,700/-has been spent on various counts which includes
			<lb />
			transit accommodation, bank guarantee, IOA deposit, revalidation fees
			<lb />
			and land premium. It is stated that also huge amounts are spent
			<lb />
			towards securing various permissions for implementation of the slum
			<lb />
			scheme, towards getting the plot numbered as Cadastral Survey
			<lb />
			Number etc. Respondent no.5 has stated that 74.63% of the eligible
			<lb />
			slum dwellers and 71% of the overall slum dwellers are in support of
			<lb />
			the implementation of the slum scheme by respondent no.5 and have
			<lb />
			shifted to temporary alternate accommodation awaiting to be
			<lb />
			rehabilitated at the earliest. In paragraph 9 of the affidavit, respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 has stated that respondent no.7 who is alleged to be a developer
			<lb />
			implementing the slum scheme in the adjoining area to the scheme in
			<lb />
			question, is responsible to create hatred, distrust and enmity between
			<lb />
			the slum dwellers with malafide intention and ulterior motive to derive
			<lb />
			undue benefit for itself with the sole purpose of hijacking the scheme in
			<lb />
			question. It is stated that the petitioner has filed series of proceedings
			<lb />
			at the instance of and/or as actively supported by respondent no.7. It is
			<lb />
			stated that Section 13(2) of the Slums Act provides the power for
			<lb />
			change of developer only when land has been, or is being, redeveloped
			<lb />
			by the owner/developer in contravention of plans, duly approved or
			<lb />
			any restrictions or conditions imposed under sub-section (10) of
			<lb />
			Section 12 or has not redeveloped within time, if any specified under
			<lb />
			such condition. It is submitted that respondent no.5 has taken
			<lb />
			substantial steps and actions in furtherance of the scheme and as there
			<lb />
			is no contravention of the plan or any delay on the part of respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 in implementation of the slum scheme, Section 13(2) of the Slums
			<lb />
			Act would not be applicable. In paragraph 11 of the reply affidavit,
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 has set out in detail the sequence of events in a tabular
			<lb />
			form. In paragraph 12 of the reply affidavit in sub-paragraphs (a) to
			<lb />
			(y), respondent no.5 has set out the reasons for which the petition
			<lb />
			would not require interference.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			41.
			<lb />
			Respondent no.5 has stated that earlier an order dated 14
			<lb />
			July 2014 was passed by the CEO-SRA on the proposal dated 11 July
			<lb />
			2014 of the Assistant Registrar of Societies which itself was based on
			<lb />
			the resolution dated 15 June 2014 and letter dated 27 June 2014 of the
			<lb />
			petitioner. It is stated that in the order dated 21 September 2015
			<lb />
			passed by the Division Bench of this Court in Writ Petition (lodg)
			<lb />
			No.673 of 2015, the order passed by the High Power Committee dated
			<lb />
			5 March 2015 was not disturbed, which had held that the resolution of
			<lb />
			termination of respondent no.5 was not legally passed by the petitioner
			<lb />
			society. It is stated that the resolution dated 15 June 2014 passed by
			<lb />
			the petitioner cannot any more be relied upon and in fact the petitioner
			<lb />
			is being estopped from doing so. It is contended that the present
			<lb />
			petition is based on a purported resolution dated 26 March 2016
			<lb />
			passed by the new Managing Committee which once again reiterates
			<lb />
			the General Body resolution dated 15 June 2014. It is stated that there
			<lb />
			is no legal ground for the petitioner to pass a resolution against
			<lb />
			respondent no.5.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			42.
			<lb />
			In so far as the rights of the shareholders of respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 who transferred their shares, it is contended that there is no
			<lb />
			restriction for such transfer either under the provisions of the Slums Act
			<lb />
			or the Development Control Regulations or under the General Body
			<lb />
			Resolution of the said societies, or even the development agreement
			<lb />
			entered with the societies. It is stated that had there been a restriction
			<lb />
			on transfer of shares by the shareholders of respondent no.5, the
			<lb />
			petitioner would have taken care to stipulate such conditions under the
			<lb />
			Development Agreement. It is stated that the terms and conditions of
			<lb />
			the Development agreement in this regard are clear and unambiguous
			<lb />
			which, in no manner restrict the rights of respondent no.5 to change
			<lb />
			the share pattern of respondent no.5. It is stated that additionally the
			<lb />
			petitioner and respondent nos.8 and 9 societies have also executed
			<lb />
			three power of attorneys all dated 18 October 2006 authorizing
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 to do various acts and deeds for the purpose of
			<lb />
			implementation of slum scheme. It is stated that the power of attorney&apos;s
			<lb />
			also empower and authorize respondent no.5 to appoint its substitute
			<lb />
			or substitutes. It is contended that further Articles 10 to 38 of Articles
			<lb />
			of Association of respondent no.5 allowed transfer of shares. It is
			<lb />
			stated that even the provisions of the Companies Act,1956 and the
			<lb />
			Companies Act,2013 also provide for transfer of shares of a
			<lb />
			private/public limited company incorporated under the said Acts. In
			<lb />
			this context, respondent no.5 has referred to the provisions of Section
			<lb />
			108 to 110 of the 1956 Act and Section 56 of the 2013 Act. It is stated
			<lb />
			that the change in shareholding pattern of respondent no.5 cannot be
			<lb />
			the ground for change of developer under Section 13(2) of the Slums
			<lb />
			Act. It is stated that respondent no.5 is a company which was earlier
			<lb />
			incorporated under the Companies Act,1956 and it is now deemed to
			<lb />
			be incorporated and governed by the Companies Act,2013 and its
			<lb />
			Articles of Association, which governs the transfer of shares. It is stated
			<lb />
			that under the Companies Act, a private or public limited company is a
			<lb />
			separate juristic entity, which has separate and independent existence
			<lb />
			in law and hence, a company being body incorporate can enter into
			<lb />
			legally binding transactions with third parties and it can sue and be
			<lb />
			sued in its own name in regard to such transaction. It is stated that
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 being a juristic person, is liable directly for the
			<lb />
			transaction entered with third parties. It is stated that the rights and
			<lb />
			liabilities of a company as a juristic entity and those of its shareholders
			<lb />
			are distinct and separate and the shareholders of a company are not
			<lb />
			directly liable to the third parties for any act done by the company and
			<lb />
			the transaction entered into with a party. It is thus contended that
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 being appointed as a developer by the said three
			<lb />
			societies under their respective resolutions and in pursuance thereto a
			<lb />
			development agreement being entered into by the societies with
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 as also power of attorney&apos;s being executed in favour of
			<lb />
			respondent no.5, binding contracts have come into existence between
			<lb />
			the three societies on one hand and respondent no.5 on the other hand
			<lb />
			and inter se rights of the parties are governed by those contracts. These
			<lb />
			agreements entered between respondent no.5 and the three societies
			<lb />
			do not give rise to any contract between the three societies and
			<lb />
			shareholders and respondent no.5. It is thus stated that the allegations
			<lb />
			of inordinate delay are required to be explained by respondent no.5
			<lb />
			and not by their (old/new) shareholders. It is stated that the share
			<lb />
			transfer in accordance with the Companies Act as well as Articles of
			<lb />
			Association is valid transfer in the eyes of law. It is stated that such
			<lb />
			transfer of shares by the shareholders of respondent no.5 to a third
			<lb />
			party does not amount to transfer or sale of the said project as alleged.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			43.
			<lb />
			Respondent no.5 has stated that in any case it has
			<lb />
			complied with the provisions of the Slums Act relating slum
			<lb />
			rehabilitation scheme including the submission of Annexure III
			<lb />
			alongwith all its requirements namely shareholding pattern, balance-
			<lb />
			sheet and other related documents and only on consideration of these
			<lb />
			documents, the SRA has issued letter of intent dated 5 February 2016.
			<lb />
			Respondent no.5 accordingly prays that the petition be dismissed.
			<lb />
			Case of Respondent nos.8 and 9 (Nav Kiran CHS and Hind Ekta CHS):-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			44.
			<lb />
			Respondent no.8 has opposed this petition. A reply
			<lb />
			affidavit of Mr.Mehmood Ahmed Shaikh, Chairman of respondent no.8,
			<lb />
			dated 20 August 2018 is placed on record. Respondent no.8 has stated
			<lb />
			that the AGRC has passed the impugned order after giving a complete
			<lb />
			opportunity to the petitioner of presenting their case and granting a
			<lb />
			full-fledged hearing for several days. It is stated that the impugned
			<lb />
			order is a well reasoned and speaking order considering all the
			<lb />
			grievances of the petitioner. It is stated that the present proceedings are
			<lb />
			initiated by the petitioner at the behest of respondent no.7 who is a
			<lb />
			rival developer who is playing mischief and trying to create obstacles
			<lb />
			and hindrances in the smooth implementation of the sanctioned slum
			<lb />
			scheme. It is stated that such action on the part of respondent no.7 is in
			<lb />
			total disregard to the interest of the petitioner and respondent nos.8
			<lb />
			and 9. Respondent no.8 has stated it never intended to change
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 as developer and in fact by a generay body resolution
			<lb />
			dated 3 May 2014 respondent no.8 has confirmed the appointment of
			<lb />
			respondent no.5. It is stated that some of the disgruntled members of
			<lb />
			respondent nos.8 and 9 and of the petitioner have formed parallel
			<lb />
			societies in the same names. It is stated that the convener of the society
			<lb />
			passed the resolution on 25 June 2014 purportedly terminating the
			<lb />
			appointment of respondent no.5 and purportedly appointing a new
			<lb />
			developer-respondent no.7. It is stated that based on such resolution
			<lb />
			dated 15 June 2014, the said parallel society made an application
			<lb />
			before respondent no.1 for change of developer. It is stated that
			<lb />
			consequent thereto an order dated 14 July 2015 came to be passed by
			<lb />
			the Chief Executive Officer, which was challenged by respondent nos.8
			<lb />
			and 9. The said proceedings continued from various authorities and
			<lb />
			finally culminated and rested in the order dated 21 September 2015
			<lb />
			passed by this Court in Writ Petition (lodg) No.673 of 2014 and Writ
			<lb />
			Petition (lodg) No.674 of 2014. It is stated that thereafter, the parallel
			<lb />
			societies made a fresh application for change of the developer before
			<lb />
			the CEO-SRA on 10 October 2015 on which the CEO-SRA passed an
			<lb />
			order dated 17 December 2015 directing the societies to hold election
			<lb />
			so as to sort out the issue as to which of the societies is before
			<lb />
			respondent no.2. It is stated that election of the managing committee
			<lb />
			was conducted on 19 March 2016. A new managing committee of the
			<lb />
			petitioner society came to be appointed. It is stated that the managing
			<lb />
			committee of respondent nos.8 and 9 continued their support in favour
			<lb />
			of respondent no.5. It is stated that the new managing committee of
			<lb />
			the petitioner did not get support from the slum dwellers and it was
			<lb />
			only the managing committee of the petitioner which had supported
			<lb />
			appointment of new developer-respondent no.7.
			<lb />
			The managing
			<lb />
			committee of the petitioner in these circumstances filed a fresh
			<lb />
			application for change of developer based on the resolution of the
			<lb />
			managing committee and not on the basis of a fresh resolution passed
			<lb />
			in general body meeting. It is stated that in fact what the managing
			<lb />
			committee of the petitioner did, was to cleverly affirm and ratify the
			<lb />
			purported resolution dated 15 June 2014 to file an application for
			<lb />
			change of developer. It is stated that the present writ petition is thus
			<lb />
			clearly filed at the behest and instance of respondent no.7 who is trying
			<lb />
			to take over the project from respondent no.5. It is thus contended that
			<lb />
			the writ petition ought not to be entertained.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			45.
			<lb />
			Respondent no.9 has also opposed this petition. A reply
			<lb />
			affidavit of Mehrunnisa Shaikh, Secretary of respondent no.9 is filed.
			<lb />
			This affidavit is similar to the affidavit filed on behalf of respondent
			<lb />
			no.8. In short both respondent nos.8 and 9 are supporting the
			<lb />
			redevelopment of the slums by respondent nos.5 and 6.
			<lb />
			Rejoinder Plea of the Petitioner:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			46.
			<lb />
			On behalf of the petitioner, a rejoinder affidavit dated 4
			<lb />
			September 2018 is filed, interalia disputing the contention of
			<lb />
			respondent no.5, that it has support of 70% of the slum dwellers. It is
			<lb />
			contended that taking recourse to a simple calculation it would show
			<lb />
			that respondent no.5 has consent of only 68.24% of the slum dwellers.
			<lb />
			It is stated that when letter of intent was issued in favour of respondent
			<lb />
			no.5, there was no amalgamation in respect of the plots bearing
			<lb />
			C.S.No.2116 (pt) and 2124 (pt) on 14 December 2009, of the plots of
			<lb />
			three societies. It is stated that amalgamation of the plots was done by
			<lb />
			CEO-SRA subsequent to letter of intent dated 5 February 2016 which
			<lb />
			procedure is contrary to the provisions of the Slums Act. It is stated that
			<lb />
			none of the terms of the LOI contemplates any amalgamation of the
			<lb />
			subject plot. It is stated that there are 669 slum structures of the
			<lb />
			petitioner society out of which respondent no.5 has purportedly
			<lb />
			obtained consent of 496 slum dwellers, however only 396 slum
			<lb />
			dwellers have appended their signatures on the common consent
			<lb />
			submitted by respondent no.5. It is contended that respondent no.5
			<lb />
			has miserably failed to explain the long delay of eight years in
			<lb />
			implementation of SRA scheme. It is stated that the reservation on the
			<lb />
			subject land cannot be a valid reason for justifying the delay as these
			<lb />
			reservations were in existence even at the time when respondent no.5
			<lb />
			was appointed as the developer. It is stated that the said position as
			<lb />
			existed in the year 2006 continued to be the same also in the year 2016
			<lb />
			when the LOI was issued in favour of respondent no.5. It is stated that
			<lb />
			even the LOI acceptance report as also the revised LOI which has been
			<lb />
			issued by the SRA mentions about these reservations. It is stated that
			<lb />
			the revised LOI issued by the SRA records that the reservation of 60.80
			<lb />
			mtrs wide D.P. Road as per the DP Plan 1991 overlaps the reservations
			<lb />
			as per DP Plan 2034. It is stated that in view thereof, respondent no.6
			<lb />
			had proposed to keep the land under reservation open and unbuilt till
			<lb />
			such time the DP Plan 2034 is finalized. It is thus submitted that the
			<lb />
			reasons given by respondent no.5 for delay in implementation of slum
			<lb />
			scheme is an hogwash and feeble attempt on the part of respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 to justify his inaction for timely implementation of the slum
			<lb />
			scheme. It is stated that even in the sanction layout respondent no.5
			<lb />
			has continued to show, the reservation of proposed 60.80 wide DP
			<lb />
			road. It is stated that respondent no.5 has purportedly obtained and
			<lb />
			secured the CRZ and environmental clearance only on 21 October 2016
			<lb />
			and 12 May 2017 respectively, that is subsequent to issuance of LOI
			<lb />
			dated 5 February 2016. It is stated that this itself negates the
			<lb />
			contention of respondent no.5 that the slum scheme was delayed on
			<lb />
			account of reservation or the CRZ issues. It is stated that there was no
			<lb />
			change in the circumstances between the year 2008, when respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 submitted a proposal to implement the composite scheme under
			<lb />
			DCR 33(10) for the three societies on C.S.No.1500(pt) (admeasuring
			<lb />
			about 7876.26 sq.mtrs) and the year 2016, when the LOI was issued in
			<lb />
			favour of respondent no.5. It is thus stated that application dated 4
			<lb />
			December 2012 made by respondent no.5 to the Principal Secretary,
			<lb />
			Urban Development Department for reduction of the width of proposed
			<lb />
			DP road to 30.40 mtrs. was of no relevance as the reservation
			<lb />
			continued in the DP 1991 and in the DP 2034 the said DP road is
			<lb />
			reduced from 60.80 mtrs. to 13.40 mtrs. It is stated that in view of
			<lb />
			Condition 41 (supra) of the LOI, respondent no.5 cannot claim any
			<lb />
			equity. It is stated that respondent no.5 totally misinterpreted the order
			<lb />
			dated 5 March 2015 passed by the HPC and the order dated 21
			<lb />
			September 2015 passed by this Court. It is stated that in fact by the
			<lb />
			order passed by this Court, all issues were left to be urged before the
			<lb />
			CEO-SRA who is observed by the Court to be the competent authority.
			<lb />
			It is reiterated that resolution dated 3 May 2014, 4 May 2014 and 7
			<lb />
			May 2014 as relied on by respondent no.5 were false and fabricated
			<lb />
			inasmuch as a general body meeting was held at the office of the
			<lb />
			respondent no.5. It is stated that CEO-SRA in passing an order dated
			<lb />
			17 May 2016 had expressly relied upon these resolutions without
			<lb />
			giving any opportunity to the petitioner to respond the same. The
			<lb />
			petitioner has set out the reasons as to why these resolutions are false
			<lb />
			and fabricated. It is stated that Omkar Developers acquired
			<lb />
			shareholding in respondent no.5 only in the year 2016 and therefore,
			<lb />
			the purported resolutions dated 3 May 2014, 4 May 2014 and 7 May
			<lb />
			2014 could never have ratified by the appointment of Omkar
			<lb />
			Developers. It is denied that the petition is being pursued by some
			<lb />
			disgruntled members who have formed parallel societies, and the said
			<lb />
			contention is totally misconceived. It is stated that the change of
			<lb />
			shareholding pattern is nothing but a backdoor entry to a new
			<lb />
			developer which is not permitted in law. The contention of respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 that 896 slum dwellers are shifted to temporary accommodation
			<lb />
			or they have accepted rent from respondent no.5, is also denied stating
			<lb />
			that there is no material to that effect as placed on record.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>

			<lb />
			The petitioner has also filed rejoinder dated 4 September
			<lb />
			2018 to the affidavits in reply filed by respondent nos.8 and 9, denying
			<lb />
			the case of respondent nos.8 and 9 as pleaded in the reply affidavits.

			<lb />
			As the contentions as raised in this petition are almost

			parties.
			<lb />
			Submissions on Behalf of Petitioner -New Janata:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			51.
			<lb />
			Mr.Madon, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has
			<lb />
			made the following submissions in supporting the prayers:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			52.
			<lb />
			At the outset it is submitted that the Chief Executive
			<lb />
			Officer of SRA and AGRC ought not to have relied upon the resolution
			<lb />
			dated 3 May 2014, 4 May 2014 and 7 May 2014 for the reason that
			<lb />
			these were false and fabricated documents, as the purported general
			<lb />
			body meetings never took place. It is not possible that these meeting
			<lb />
			could have been held at the registered address of respondent no.5 (at
			<lb />
			the relevant time), as the same was not large enough to accommodate
			<lb />
			all the eligible members of the societies who are about 800. Also that
			<lb />
			the resolutions bear the signatures of individuals who were deceased
			<lb />
			on the date when the said resolutions were claimed to have been
			<lb />
			passed by the societies and that there are death certificates of the said
			<lb />
			members with the petitioner. It is submitted that some members have
			<lb />
			signed twice. It is submitted that these resolutions surfaced for the first
			<lb />
			time only on 9 May 2016 from the custody of respondent no.5 and
			<lb />
			these resolutions were neither produced nor relied upon by any parties
			<lb />
			including respondent no.5 in any proceedings prior to 9 May 2016. In
			<lb />
			supporting this submission, it is submitted that even in the earlier
			<lb />
			round of litigation when an order dated 18 December 2014 was passed
			<lb />
			by this Court in Writ Petition No.8410 of 2014 and connected matters,
			<lb />
			these resolutions were neither relied nor any reference was made to
			<lb />
			these resolutions. In fact this Court observed that the development
			<lb />
			agreement was terminated in the year 2014 and a new developer by
			<lb />
			name SLK was appointed to redevelop the said property while referring
			<lb />
			to the General Body Resolutions dated 11 May 2014, 15 June 2014 and
			<lb />
			22 June 2014 passed by respondent no.8, petitioner and respondent
			<lb />
			no.9 respectively. It is contended that neither respondent no.5 nor the
			<lb />
			rival factions of the petitioner, respondent nos.8 and 9 have challenged
			<lb />
			these resolutions and hence, these resolutions have attained a finality.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that in none of the proceedings even in Writ Petition
			<lb />
			no.8410, 8412 and 8414 of 2014, which were disposed of by an order
			<lb />
			dated 18 December 2014, there was any reference or mention of the
			<lb />
			alleged resolutions dated 3 May 2014, 4 May 2014 and 7 May 2014.
			<lb />
			Moreover, in the said petitions, there is mention of general body
			<lb />
			meetings dated 11 May 2014, 15 June 2014 and 22 June 2014 wherein
			<lb />
			it was unanimously decided to terminate the appointment of
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 and to appoint respondent no.7 as new developer. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that even in the subsequent writ petition being Writ Petition
			<lb />
			(Lodg) No.673 of 2015 filed by respondent no.9 herein, in paragraph 7,
			<lb />
			there were similar averments and thus, it is clearly seen that these
			<lb />
			resolutions of May 2014 as relied by respondent No.5 have seen the
			<lb />
			light of the day only on 9 May 2016. It is submitted that these
			<lb />
			resolutions were not even served on the petitioner, when under a
			<lb />
			covering letter dated 8 May 2016 they were purported to be submitted
			<lb />
			to the CEO-SRA on 9 May 2016. It is submitted that the petitioner
			<lb />
			became aware of the covering letter and these resolutions only from the
			<lb />
			order dated 17 May 2016 passed by CEO-SRA. The petitioner hence
			<lb />
			did not have any opportunity to deal with these documents.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			53.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that even assuming that these resolutions
			<lb />
			are genuine, the petitioner, respondent nos.8 and 9 had held meetings
			<lb />
			on 11 May 2014, 15 June 2014 and 22 June 2014 whereby the
			<lb />
			appointment of respondent nos.5 and 6 were terminated. It is nobody&apos;s
			<lb />
			case that respondent nos.5 and 6 have thereafter been reappointed. It
			<lb />
			is submitted that the members of respondent nos.8 and 9 have filed an
			<lb />
			application under Section 13(2) of the Slums Act for removal of
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 and appointment of respondent no.7 as developer and
			<lb />
			that these applications are still pending. It is submitted that it was not
			<lb />
			permissible for the newly appointed managing committee of
			<lb />
			respondent nos.8 and 9 to act contrary to the general body resolution
			<lb />
			supporting respondent no.5. It is submitted that the petitioner
			<lb />
			impugned the purported resolutions of May 2014 before the AGRC,
			<lb />
			however the AGRC failed to render any cogent findings on the
			<lb />
			contention of fabrication as raised by the petitioner.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			54.
			<lb />
			The conclusion of the AGRC that respondent nos.5 and 6
			<lb />
			still have consent of more than 70% slum dwellers, is an incorrect
			<lb />
			finding without application of mind. It is submitted that the AGRC
			<lb />
			ought to have considered that at every stage respondent no.5 prevented
			<lb />
			the holding of general body meeting of all three societies knowing fully
			<lb />
			well that at such meeting they would not have the requisite support. It
			<lb />
			is contended that the rival factions of respondent nos.8 and 9 in
			<lb />
			collusion with respondent no.5 and 6 are contending before this Court
			<lb />
			that the explanation justifying the signatures of such deceased
			<lb />
			individuals on the purported resolutions as furnished in the affidavit
			<lb />
			filed before the AGRC be accepted, so as to justify the order of the
			<lb />
			AGRC, by reading its order in consonance with the affidavit filed by
			<lb />
			them. It is submitted that when a statutory functionary makes an order
			<lb />
			based on certain grounds, its validity must be judged by the reasons so
			<lb />
			mentioned and cannot be supplemented by fresh reasons in the shape
			<lb />
			of affidavit. In support of this submissions, Mr.Madon, learned Senior
			<lb />
			Counsel has referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			&quot;Mohinder Singh Gill &amp; Anr. Vs. The Chief Election Commissioner, New
			<lb />
			Delhi &amp; Ors.&quot; 1
			<lb />
			1 (1978)1 SCC 405
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			55.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the impugned order passed by the
			<lb />
			CEO -SRA is in clear breach of principles of natural justice, this for the
			<lb />
			reason that on 5 May 2016 the proceedings before the CEO-SRA were
			<lb />
			closed for orders, however, respondent no.5 through its advocate
			<lb />
			addressed a letter dated 8 May 2016, filed on 9 May 2016 with the
			<lb />
			CEO-SRA interalia producing certain additional documents. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that the covering letter recorded that additional documents
			<lb />
			were being filed in accordance with the direction given on 5 May 2016
			<lb />
			by CEO SRA when no such permission was either sought or granted for
			<lb />
			submission of additional documents by the CEO SRA. It is submitted
			<lb />
			that roznama dated 5 May 2016 does not mention any such
			<lb />
			order/direction being made on 5 May 2016 permitting any additional
			<lb />
			document to be filed by any of the parties. It is thus submitted that no
			<lb />
			opportunity was granted to the petitioner to respond to the said
			<lb />
			documents before CEO-SRA. It is submitted that despite the fact that
			<lb />
			these documents were filed for the first time on 9 May 2014 and were
			<lb />
			not referred at the hearing before CEO SRA, nonetheless CEO-SRA in
			<lb />
			its order has referred to the arguments purportedly advanced by the
			<lb />
			Advocate for respondent no.5 on the basis of these documents. It is
			<lb />
			thus submitted that these documents have been received as valid
			<lb />
			evidence and have gone into the decision making process forming one
			<lb />
			of the basis of the impugned order dated 17 May 2016 passed by the
			<lb />
			CEO-SRA. It is thus submitted that there is clear breach of the
			<lb />
			principles of natural justice in passing the order referring to the
			<lb />
			material not furnished to the petitioner. In support of this contention,
			<lb />
			Mr.Madon has placed reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			(i)Shantidevi Kamaleshkumar Yadav vs. State of Maharashtra &amp; Ors. 2
			<lb />
			and (ii) Suresh Dhanuka Vs. Sunita Mohapatra 3 . Mr.Madon has also
			<lb />
			relied on the decision of this Court in M/s.Platinum Realty &amp; Anr. Vs.
			<lb />
			The State of Maharashtra 4
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			56.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the CEO-SRA relying on the May
			<lb />
			2014 General Body Resolutions of the three societies, purportedly
			<lb />
			showing support to respondent No.5 and 6 infact would amount to a
			<lb />
			gross breach of the principles of natural justice at the very first
			<lb />
			adjudication. This basic breach of the principles of natural justice and
			<lb />
			of an unfair trial cannot be remedied in appeal. Mr.Madon has
			<lb />
			submitted that the nature of violation as aforesaid was categorically
			<lb />
			brought to the attention of AGRC and the AGRC in these circumstances
			<lb />
			ought to have remanded the matter back to CEO-SRA for considering
			<lb />
			the dispute afresh, on the said documents produced subsequent to the
			<lb />
			closure of the hearing by respondent no.5. However, the AGRC failed
			<lb />
			to relegate the matter back to respondent no.2 on the ground that the
			<lb />
			petitioner has eventually been afforded an opportunity to respond to
			<lb />
			the new documents. It is submitted that it is settled proposition of law
			<lb />
			that the initial defect of breach of the principles of natural justice
			<lb />
			cannot be cured in appellate proceedings. To support this submission
			<lb />
			Mr.Madon has placed reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			Institute of Chartered Accountants of India Vs. L.K.Ratna &amp; Ors. 5 and to
			<lb />
			the decision of this Court in Partha Ghosh &amp; Anrs. Vs. Insitute of
			<lb />
			Chartered Accountants of India 6 and in Associated Tube Wells Ltd. Vs.
			<lb />
			R.B.Gujarmal Modi 7 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			57.
			<lb />
			In regard to the transfer of shareholding in respondent
			<lb />
			no.5, Mr.Madon would submit that when the petitioner, respondent
			<lb />
			nos.8 and 9 executed the development agreement dated 17 October
			<lb />
			2006 in favour of respondent no.5, 100% of the shareholding of
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 was held and controlled by Mohanlal Senghani and
			<lb />
			Chandulal Senghani. It is submitted that although the development
			<lb />
			agreement was entered with respondent no.5, the said developer was
			<lb />
			appointed only because the members had reposed faith in the
			<lb />
			promoters namely Senghani family which exercised complete control
			<lb />
			over respondent no.5 and hence, in effect the consents were given by
			<lb />
			the slum dwellers in favour of the Senghani family. It is submitted that
			<lb />
			in the year 2008, the share capital of respondent no.5 increased from
			<lb />
			Rs.1,00,000/-to Rs.5,00,000/-, however, the shareholding of
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 continued to remain with the Senghani family. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that in the year 2012 the share capital of respondent no.5
			<lb />
			was increased and 50,000 new shares were allotted to Mr.Paras Porwal
			<lb />
			who effectively became a 50% shareholder in respondent no.5-
			<lb />
			company. Mr.Madon would submit that in March 2015, the Senghani
			<lb />
			family sold their entire shareholding to Mr.Ronnie Porwal, consequently
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 was entirely controlled by the Porwal family. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that the petitioner and respondent nos.8 and 9 had executed
			<lb />
			consent in favour of respondent no.5 only because the Senghani family
			<lb />
			controlled the said company. It is thus submitted that in the year 2015
			<lb />
			after the sale of the shareholding, respondent no.5 was a new entity, in
			<lb />
			favour of which no consents were executed. According to Mr.Madon,
			<lb />
			this amounted to sale of the slum scheme by Senghani family in favour
			<lb />
			of Porwal family (M/s.Omkar Realtors) which was not permissible
			<lb />
			interalia by virtue of SRA Office Order dated 12 March 2015. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that these vital facts were not brought to the notice of the
			<lb />
			SRA, the petitioner or respondent nos.8 and 9. Mr.Madon would submit
			<lb />
			that thereafter on 25 January 2016 the majority shareholding of
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 was sold to M/s.Omkar Realtors and a fresh allotment
			<lb />
			of 1,24,50,000 shares valued at Rs.12,45,00,000/-was made in favour
			<lb />
			of M/s.Omkar Realtors, whereby it became 99.20% shareholder of
			<lb />
			respondent no.5. It is submitted that the petitioner, respondent nos.8
			<lb />
			and 9 were again not informed of these changes in the shareholding
			<lb />
			pattern as also no official intimation of such change was also given to
			<lb />
			SRA. Thus, according to Mr.Madon, these changes in the shareholding
			<lb />
			pattern are clearly hit by the office order dated 23 March 2015 issued
			<lb />
			by the SRA, whereby any change in partners/directors, or their
			<lb />
			shareholding was required to be intimated to SRA within thirty days as
			<lb />
			also premium is required to be paid, failing which a fine equal to 5
			<lb />
			times of the value of the land is leveyed on the developer. Mr.Madon
			<lb />
			would submit that, respondent No.5 having not complied with these
			<lb />
			orders of the SRA, such a change in the shareholding ought not to have
			<lb />
			been accepted by the CEO-SRA. On this count alone, it ought to have
			<lb />
			held by the AGRC that respondent no.5 was not entitled to be
			<lb />
			continued as a developer of the petitioner and respondent nos.8 and 9
			<lb />
			societies. It is submitted that also AGRC despite being aware of this
			<lb />
			change carried out by respondent no.5 in its shareholding and
			<lb />
			directorial pattern, failed to pass necessary directions in accordance
			<lb />
			with the office order. This was valid ground for termination of the
			<lb />
			appointment of respondent no.5 also under Section 13(2) of the Act. It
			<lb />
			is submitted that even the premium which was required to be paid
			<lb />
			having not been paid, has caused substantial loss to the public
			<lb />
			exchequer. It is submitted that, infact there is breach at two stages by
			<lb />
			respondent no.5, firstly when the shareholding changed hands from
			<lb />
			Senghani family to Porwal and from Porwal&apos;s to M/s.Omkar Realtors,
			<lb />
			when respondent no.5 was bound to inform the SRA. It is submitted
			<lb />
			that even every change in the directorial pattern post 2015 was
			<lb />
			required to be informed to SRA by respondent no.5.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			58.
			<lb />
			Mr.Madon submits that this was effectively a sale by
			<lb />
			respondent No.5 of the right to implement the slum rehabilitation
			<lb />
			scheme to a third party, for which no permission was obtained by
			<lb />
			Omkar Realtors or respondent no.5 before issuance/sale of shares. It is
			<lb />
			thus submitted that respondent no.5 did not have the necessary
			<lb />
			financial capability nor the experience to implement the slum scheme
			<lb />
			and therefore, respondent no.5 altered its shareholding pattern in
			<lb />
			order to comply with the requirements of Annexure III. It is for this
			<lb />
			reason shares of respondent no.5 were first sold by the Senghanis to
			<lb />
			Porwals and subsequently M/s.Omkar Realtors was inducted only with
			<lb />
			an intention to sell the rights, to implement the Slum Scheme which is
			<lb />
			expressly prohibited. Mr.Madon would hence submit that the AGRC
			<lb />
			erred in rejecting the contention of the petitioner in respect of such
			<lb />
			transfer/sale of the slum scheme by Senghanis to Porwal and then to
			<lb />
			M/s.Omkar, on the ground that there was no bar for transfer of shares
			<lb />
			under the Companies Act.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			59.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the petitioner&apos;s contention is not that
			<lb />
			there would be any bar on transfer of shares under the Companies Act,
			<lb />
			what the petitioner objects is the manner in which the composition/
			<lb />
			control/management of respondent no.5 had undergone a complete
			<lb />
			change between March 2015 and January 2016, which was done to
			<lb />
			circumvent the procedure prescribed under the Slums Act. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that it is settled principle of law that what cannot be done
			<lb />
			directly cannot be done indirectly. Mr.Madon would submit that Omkar
			<lb />
			Realtors has indirectly purchased the slum scheme, sale of which was
			<lb />
			otherwise prohibited under the Slums Act. In support of these
			<lb />
			contentions, Mr.Madon relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			&quot;State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors. VS. Gotan Lime Stone Khanji Udyog Pvt.Ltd.
			<lb />
			&amp; Anr&quot; 8 and &quot;Estate Officer, UT, Chandigarh &amp; Ors. Vs. Esys Information
			<lb />
			Technologies Pte.Ltd.&quot; 9
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			60.
			<lb />
			Mr.Madon would next submit that delay in implementation
			<lb />
			of slum scheme is a ground for setting aside the appointment of
			<lb />
			developers under Section 13(2) of the Slums Act. It is submitted that
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 was appointed as a developer in the year 2006 and
			<lb />
			after being so appointed, respondent no.5 took no steps whatsoever
			<lb />
			between 2006-2008. It is submitted that only in August 2008,
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 submitted a proposal with the SRA to implement a
			<lb />
			composite scheme on plot no.1500 (pt) and the proposal was thereafter
			<lb />
			revised in December 2009 to include CTS No.2116 (pt) and 2124 (pt)
			<lb />
			and Annexures II was certified in the year 2010. It is submitted that
			<lb />
			thereafter, no steps whatsoever were taken by respondent no.5 for
			<lb />
			implementation of the Slum scheme on the subject property from 2010
			<lb />
			(from issuance of Annexure II) till April 2014. It is submitted that, in
			<lb />
			view of the inordinate delay in implementation of the slum scheme, an
			<lb />
			undertaking/letter dated 10 April 2014 was furnished by respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 to the petitioner, respondent nos.8 and 9 interalia assuring the
			<lb />
			societies that it would complete the work of redevelopment and that it
			<lb />
			would obtain the letter of intent for implementation of the slum
			<lb />
			scheme latest by 30 June 2014, failing which, respondent no.5 would
			<lb />
			itself resign as a developer and withdraw from the slum scheme. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that the reasons furnished by respondent no.5 for justifying
			<lb />
			the inordinate delay in implementation of the slum scheme were that
			<lb />
			the land was affected by development plan road (DP Road) and part of
			<lb />
			the said land fell under CRZ were misconceived. It is submitted that
			<lb />
			these reservations were existing even in 2006 when respondent no.5
			<lb />
			was appointed as a developer. It is submitted that only when the
			<lb />
			petitioner addressed a letter dated 31 May 2014 to the Architect-
			<lb />
			respondent No.6 and respondent no.5, interalia calling upon
			<lb />
			respondent no.6 not to represent the petitioner before the SRA or any
			<lb />
			other Government office or produce any document on behalf of the
			<lb />
			petitioner or obtain any sanction on their behalf, that respondent no.6
			<lb />
			submitted an application dated 6 June 2014 to the SRA for issuance of
			<lb />
			the LOI and subsequently Annexure III was issued on 4 February 2016
			<lb />
			and an LOI was issued on 5 February 2016. It is submitted that
			<lb />
			pertinently the very same reservations are also reflected in the LOI
			<lb />
			which was issued by CEO SRA, which would show that the reservation
			<lb />
			of D.P. Road, CRZ etc. were always in existence. This is also borne out
			<lb />
			from the LOI itself, which records that respondent no.5 is required to
			<lb />
			obtain clearances from MCZMA and MOEF before seeking grant of
			<lb />
			commencement certificate for the first building in the layout. In
			<lb />
			supporting this submission, Mr.Madon has placed reliance on the
			<lb />
			decision of this Court in Hi Tech India Construction Vs. Chief Executive
			<lb />
			Officer, Slum Rehabilitation Authority, Mumbai 10
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			61.
			<lb />
			The next submission of Mr.Madon is in regard to the
			<lb />
			actions taken by Omkar Realtors subsequent to acquiring 99.20% of the
			<lb />
			10 2013(3) Mh.L.J. 707
			<lb />
			shareholding in respondent no.5 on 25 January 2016. It is submitted
			<lb />
			that within 10 days of Omkar Realtors coming into the picture, the SRA
			<lb />
			issued Annexure-III, surprisingly despite there being no written
			<lb />
			communication whatsoever from Omkar Realtors and SRA interalia
			<lb />
			informing the SRA about the change of registered address as also about
			<lb />
			the change in shareholding. This according to the petitioner, is seen
			<lb />
			from Annexure-III issued by SRA which refers to the address of Omkar
			<lb />
			Realtors as address of respondent no.5.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			62.
			<lb />
			The next submission of Mr.Madon, learned Senior Counsel
			<lb />
			for the petitioner is on the errors in the orders passed by the CEO-SRA
			<lb />
			and the AGRC. It is submitted that despite a clear direction contained
			<lb />
			in the order dated 21 September 2015 passed by the Division Bench in
			<lb />
			Writ Petition (l) no.673 and 674 of 2015 directing that &quot;SRA will take a
			<lb />
			decision uninfluenced by any observations and conclusions in the
			<lb />
			impugned order and including an order of this Court&quot;, and further in
			<lb />
			Clause 41 of the LOI stating as &quot;The LOI will have no bearing
			<lb />
			whatsoever on any parallel proceedings under any section of the
			<lb />
			Maharashtra Slum Area (I, C and R) Act,1971&quot;, SRA has wrongfully not
			<lb />
			only referred to the order of HPC but also made it the basis of his
			<lb />
			finding in context of viability. The CEO-SRA has observed that the
			<lb />
			aspect of viability of the same was considered by the HPC in paragraph
			<lb />
			(8) of the order dated 27 February 2015. It is submitted that in view
			<lb />
			thereof, respondent no.2 was of the view that there is no willful delay
			<lb />
			and non performance on the part of respondent no.5.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			63.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the facts and circumstances of the
			<lb />
			case would require interference of this Court in writ jurisdiction, this
			<lb />
			for the reason that the SRA was not an expert body but merely a
			<lb />
			planning authority under the MRTP Act as also under the Slums Act
			<lb />
			and as a planning authority the SRA is expected to strictly follow the
			<lb />
			rules and regulations and in case of any deviation, interference in
			<lb />
			exercise of power under Article 226 and 227 would be warranted. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that in any event when civil consequences ensue, there is
			<lb />
			hardly any distinction between an administrative or quasi judicial
			<lb />
			order. It is submitted that Supreme Court in &quot;Rajesh Kumar &amp; Ors. Vs.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			D.Commissioner of Income Tax &amp; Ors.&quot; 11 has held that a thin
			<lb />
			demarcated line between an administrative order and quasi-judicial
			<lb />
			order now stands obliterated. It is submitted that the impugned order
			<lb />
			passed by CEO SRA in exercise of powers conferred under Section
			<lb />
			13(2) of the Slums Act, in essence is a quasi-judicial function in respect
			<lb />
			of which jurisdiction of even civil court is barred by virtue of Section 42
			<lb />
			of the Slums Act. It is submitted that there are several findings which
			<lb />
			are contained in the impugned order passed by the CEO-SRA, which
			<lb />
			are perverse and contrary to not only Appendix IV of Development
			<lb />
			Control Regulation for Greater Mumbai, 1991 but also to the record of
			<lb />
			SRA.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			64.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that even the Apex Grievance Redressal
			<lb />
			Committee has failed to consider relevant facts and records of the SRA
			<lb />
			and the findings that &quot;there were hurdles due to the provisions of the
			<lb />
			CRZ and reservations of DP Road&quot; and &quot;various other reservations&quot; as
			<lb />
			made in the orders passed by AGRC are contrary to the record of the
			<lb />
			SRA and in particular to the LOI Scrutiny Report dated 14 July 2014
			<lb />
			and to the letter of intent dated 5 February 2016. It is submitted that
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 was attempting to set up a new case so as to justify
			<lb />
			inordinate and willful delay in implementation of the slum scheme
			<lb />
			which were contrary to the record, as the reservation enumerated in
			<lb />
			the LOI scrutiny report existed at all material times right from
			<lb />
			respondent No.5&apos;s appointment as a developer.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			65.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the primary point is of inordinate delay
			<lb />
			on the part of respondent no.5 in commencing with the slum scheme,
			<lb />
			there is no justification whatsoever in explaining such delay.
			<lb />
			submissions, the petition needs to be allowed.
			<lb />
			Submissions on behalf of Petitioner-SLK Buildcon Pvt Ltd.:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			67.
			<lb />
			Dr.Saraf, learned Counsel for the petitioner in Writ Petition
			<lb />
			No.2285 of 2018 and for respondent no.7 in Writ Petition No.2349 of
			<lb />
			2018, in supporting the submissions of Mr.Madon, has made the
			<lb />
			following submissions:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			68.
			<lb />
			At the outset, it is submitted that the slum rehabilitation
			<lb />
			scheme is not an ordinary development agreement, under which the
			<lb />
			right to implement and execute a slum scheme can be transferred or
			<lb />
			assigned. This considering the statutory scheme as also the guidelines
			<lb />
			issued by the authorities. It is submitted that a slum scheme approved
			<lb />
			for any particular slum rehabilitation area, is a developer specific
			<lb />
			scheme, approved in favour of a particular developer who has consent
			<lb />
			of 70% of the slum dwellers and who fulfills the criteria and has the
			<lb />
			financial ability to execute the scheme. It is submitted that it is thus not
			<lb />
			open to a developer whose scheme has been approved to, directly or
			<lb />
			indirectly, assign or transfer the right to execute the scheme or to
			<lb />
			substitute some other developer in his place to execute and implement
			<lb />
			that scheme.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			69.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that 70% consent in favour of a particular
			<lb />
			developer is the sine qua non and a fundamental pre-condition for
			<lb />
			presentation of a scheme. It is mandatory to have 70% consent at the
			<lb />
			time of making of the application and is not permitted to be acquired
			<lb />
			subsequently.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			70.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the entire legislative scheme and the
			<lb />
			guidelines as also the decisions of the Courts, make it apparent that
			<lb />
			once the scheme in favour of a particular developer is sanctioned, it is
			<lb />
			to be taken to a logical end. It is submitted that when a particular
			<lb />
			scheme is being considered, no other scheme can be simultaneously
			<lb />
			considered, and once a scheme is sanctioned, either the developer
			<lb />
			completes the development in accordance with the scheme or if the
			<lb />
			developer fails to do so, the developer is replaced by the authority and
			<lb />
			then the authority itself undertakes the development in accordance
			<lb />
			with Section 13(2) of the Slums Act. It is thus submitted that neither
			<lb />
			the slum dwellers nor the developer has any right to replace/substitute
			<lb />
			the developer without intervention and permission of the authority. A
			<lb />
			new developer, if appointed, would have to be assessed on the same
			<lb />
			basis as originally required before sanction of the scheme including the
			<lb />
			support of 70% of the slum dwellers.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			71.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that if the developer is permitted to directly
			<lb />
			or indirectly replace or substitute someone else in his place or to
			<lb />
			transfer or assign the benefits of the scheme, the same would defeat the
			<lb />
			object and scheme of the legislation, and would have far reaching
			<lb />
			consequences. It may lead to rendering a slum scheme, an ordinary
			<lb />
			marketable or tradable right/benefit and it would lead to a situation
			<lb />
			that the developer does not have a mandatorily required support of the
			<lb />
			slum dwellers but is permitted to undertake a scheme. There may also
			<lb />
			be circumstances where an entity which does not have financial ability
			<lb />
			may put up another entity to get a slum scheme approved and may
			<lb />
			thereafter acquire rights from that entity, this would defeat the entire
			<lb />
			object and purpose of introducing the various safeguards and
			<lb />
			preconditions. In making these above submissions Dr.Saraf has
			<lb />
			referred to the provisions of the Slums Act and the provisions of
			<lb />
			General Slum Rehabilitation scheme, relevant guidelines for
			<lb />
			implementation of slum rehabilitation scheme, to the relevant
			<lb />
			provisions of Development Control Regulations and the decisions of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in Susme Builders Pvt. Ltd. Vs. CEO SRA &amp; Ors. 12 ; in
			<lb />
			Pramila Suman Singh Vs. State of Maharashtra 13 and the decisions of
			<lb />
			this Court in &quot;Awdesh Vasistha Tiwari Vs. Chief Executive Officer, Slum
			<lb />
			Rehabilitation Authority&quot; 14, in &quot;Atesham Ahmed Khan V. Lakadawala
			<lb />
			Developers Pvt. Ltd. 15 and in &quot;Lokhandwala Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra&quot; 16
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			72.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the restrictions set out in circular
			<lb />
			dated 23 March 2015 issued by the SRA also does not imply that by
			<lb />
			transfer of shares or partners, the slum scheme can be transferred or
			<lb />
			assigned without following the procedure under Section 13(2) of the
			<lb />
			Slums Act. It is submitted that in the present case, this circular has not
			<lb />
			been complied, even the payments required to be made under the
			<lb />
			circular. It is submitted that even the development agreement between
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 and slum dweller societies prohibits any transfer as
			<lb />
			provided in Clause 43 of the said agreement.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			73.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that when the statute mandates that
			<lb />
			something should be done in a particular way, even when there are no
			<lb />
			negative words, the thing cannot be done in any other way. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that this is a rule of implied prohibition. In supporting this
			<lb />
			contention, reliance is placed on the decision of Jamal Uddin Ahmad V.
			<lb />
			Abu Saleh Najmuddin 17 ; Center for Public Interest Litigation Vs. Union
			<lb />
			14 (2006)4 Mah L.J. 282
			<lb />
			15 (2011)3 Mah.L.J.604
			<lb />
			16 (2011)3 Mh.L.J. 469
			<lb />
			17 (2003)4 SCC 257
			<lb />
			of India &amp; Anr. 18
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			74.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that if any devise or method is adopted to
			<lb />
			achieve something indirectly which is otherwise not permissible under
			<lb />
			a Statute, the same is a fraud on the Statute. It is submitted that it is
			<lb />
			well settled principle of law that the statutory provisions of the Act
			<lb />
			shall not be evaded by shift or contrivance and to carry out effectually
			<lb />
			the object of a Statute, it must be construed to defeat all attempts to
			<lb />
			do, or avoid doing, in an indirect or circuitous manner that which it has
			<lb />
			prohibited or enjoined. In support of this submission, reliance is placed
			<lb />
			on the decision in Shrisht Dhawan (Smt) Vs. Shaw Bros. 19 ; Jagir Singh
			<lb />
			Vs. Ranbir Singh 20 , and the decision of Delhi High Court in The
			<lb />
			Associated Journal Ltd. &amp; Anr. Vs. Land and Development Office 21
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			75.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that if a corporate entity is being abused as
			<lb />
			a cloak to defeat law and play fraud, such a veil should be pierced to
			<lb />
			see the persons behind such entity. It is submitted that where a device
			<lb />
			of incorporation is used for an illegal or improper purpose, the court is
			<lb />
			entitled to lift the veil, the concept of a corporate entity cannot be used
			<lb />
			to commit an illegality or defraud people, and where such an entity is
			<lb />
			being used to achieve such an end, the corporate character of such an
			<lb />
			entity can be ignored to see the reality behind the corporate veil. In
			<lb />
			support of his submission, reliance is placed on the decision of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in (i) &quot;Vodafone International Holdings BV Vs. Union of
			<lb />
			India &amp; Anr. 22 , (ii) CIT Vs. Sri Meenakshi Mills Ltd. 23 ; (iii) Workmen V.
			<lb />
			Associated Rubber Industry Ltd. 24 ; (iv) Delhi Development Authority
			<lb />
			Vs.Skipper Construction Co.(P) Ltd. &amp; Anr. 25
			<lb />
			76.
			<lb />
			Dr.Saraf has also made submissions on the factual
			<lb />
			aspects of the matter including an inordinate delay of respondent
			<lb />
			No.5 in implementing the slums scheme and on how respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 would not be eligible to continue as a developer which are
			<lb />
			submissions similar to the submission as made by Mr. Madon.
			<lb />
			Submissions of behalf of respondent Nos.2 to 4 (SRA):-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			77.
			<lb />
			Mr.Jagtiani learned counsel for respondent no. 2 to 4 -
			<lb />
			Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) has made the following
			<lb />
			submissions :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			78.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the petitioner&apos;s case of breach of
			<lb />
			principles of natural justice in the CEO passing the impugned order, is
			<lb />
			misconceived. This for the reason that in appeal the AGRC had granted
			<lb />
			an opportunity to all the parties to make submissions on all the
			<lb />
			documents which were submitted on behalf of the parties before the
			<lb />
			CEO, SRA. It is submitted that the petitioner did not make any specific
			<lb />
			submissions with respect to the three documents namely letter dated
			<lb />
			26 May 2009 addressed by Office of Collector and District Magistrate
			<lb />
			Mumbai City to Additional Secretary Revenue, letter dated 28 July
			<lb />
			2009 addressed by Revenue and Forest Department to Collector and
			<lb />
			letter dated 6 March 2010 addressed by respondent No.6 to Additional
			<lb />
			Collector. In regard to the petitioner&apos;s submission with respect to
			<lb />
			documents namely Minutes of the Special General Body Meeting dated
			<lb />
			3 May 2014 of Hind Ekta CHS (P.) (Respondent No.8) and Minutes of
			<lb />
			the Special General Body Meeting dated 4 May 2014 of Navkiran CHS
			<lb />
			(P) (Respondent No.9) and copy of the Special General Body Meeting
			<lb />
			dated 7 May 2014, that these documents are fabricated, it is submitted
			<lb />
			that the submissions of the petitioner are appropriately dealt in the
			<lb />
			impugned orders passed by the AGRC. Mr.Jagtiani has contended that
			<lb />
			the decisions as relied on behalf of the petitioner to support its case
			<lb />
			that there is breach of the principles of natural justice are in applicable
			<lb />
			in the facts of the case. Mr.Jagtiani would submit that in any event it is
			<lb />
			settled principle of law that a fair appeal would cure an unfair trial. In
			<lb />
			support of his submissions, reliance is placed on the decision of the
			<lb />
			Privy Council in Ferd Dawson Calvin vs. John Henry Brownlow Carr &amp;
			<lb />
			Ors. 26 . It is submitted that this decision considers the law laid down in
			<lb />
			Leary vs. National Union of Vehicle Builders 27 which has been referred
			<lb />
			by the Supreme Court in the decision in Institute of Chartered
			<lb />
			Accountants of India vs. L.K. Ratna &amp; Ors. 28 . It is submitted that the
			<lb />
			decision in Ferd Dawson Calvin vs. John Henry Brownlow Carr &amp; Ors.
			<lb />
			(supra) has also been followed by the Division Bench of this Court in
			<lb />
			Air India Corporation vs. Richard Rashid Khan 29 and noticed by the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in the case of State Bank of Patiala and Ors. Vs. S.K.
			<lb />
			Sharma 30 . It is submitted that the decision of Privy Council in Ferd
			<lb />
			Dawson Calvin vs. John Henry Brownlow Carr &amp; Ors. (supra) has also
			<lb />
			been followed by the Privy Council in Lloyds vs. McMahon 31 which is
			<lb />
			also noticed by a Full Bench of this Court in Shantilal Ambalal Mehta
			<lb />
			vs. M.A. Rangaswamy 32 and the Supreme Court in Kanwar Natwar
			<lb />
			Singh vs. Director of Enforcement and Ors. 33 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			79.
			<lb />
			Mr.Jagtiani referring to the above decisions, would submit
			<lb />
			that there cannot be any complaint of the petitioner on this count, as
			<lb />
			the AGRC has fully and exhaustively heard all the parties at length on
			<lb />
			all the documents and even on the documents in regard to which the
			<lb />
			petitioner complained that they were not furnished before the CEO,
			<lb />
			SRA. It is submitted that the AGRC has found that even after
			<lb />
			consideration of these documents, there is no need to remand the
			<lb />
			matter back to the CEO, SRA and that there was no infirmity alleged or
			<lb />
			otherwise in the orders which are passed by the CEO, SRA warranting
			<lb />
			interference by the AGRC. It is thus submitted that there is no denial of
			<lb />
			natural justice to the petitioner and the defect if any in the proceedings
			<lb />
			before the CEO, SRA was duly cured by the AGRC with a practical
			<lb />
			alternative of rehearing the parties instead of remanding back the
			<lb />
			matter to the CEO, SRA. It is submitted that the AGRC had the
			<lb />
			jurisdiction to reconsider on merits all the issues considered by the
			<lb />
			CEO, SRA as well as issues which were not raised by the petitioner
			<lb />
			before the CEO, SRA and which were raised by the petitioner before the
			<lb />
			AGRC and thus no prejudice was caused to the petitioner on account of
			<lb />
			the CEO, SRA considering the 7 documents filed on 8 May 2015
			<lb />
			without notice to the petitioner as alleged. As a hearing was granted to
			<lb />
			the petitioner on all these documents and even otherwise on grounds
			<lb />
			which were not raised by the petitioner before the CEO, SRA as argued
			<lb />
			by the petitioner before the AGRC, which have been exhaustively dealt
			<lb />
			with, in the impugned order dated 11 January 2018 passed by the
			<lb />
			AGRC. Hence the petitioner&apos;s contention that there is any breach of the
			<lb />
			principles of natural justice, cannot be accepted.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			80.
			<lb />
			Mr.Jagtiani would next submit that on a reading of Rules 7
			<lb />
			and 8 of the Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement, Clearance and
			<lb />
			Redevelopment) (Grievance Redressal Committees) Rules, 2014, it is
			<lb />
			clear that the AGRC has the requisite jurisdiction to reconsider and
			<lb />
			hear de novo, all issues raised by the parties, whether such issues were
			<lb />
			raised before the CEO, SRA or not. It is submitted that the relevant
			<lb />
			provisions of these rules provide for the powers of the AGRC to call for
			<lb />
			records, require attendance of any person, direct any officer to
			<lb />
			undertake inspection, engage third parties to undertake inspection,
			<lb />
			initiate proceedings suo moto (Rule 7(2)(iv)), undertake local
			<lb />
			inspection (Rule 7(3)), and hear new points of fact raised by the
			<lb />
			appellant before the AGRC. It is submitted that the AGRC has
			<lb />
			discretion under Rule 8(2) of the said Rules to dispose of an appeal by
			<lb />
			remanding it back for disposal as per the provisions of the Slums Act
			<lb />
			and respective DCRs to the concerned officer or authority. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that the AGRC has, by recording reasons chosen not to
			<lb />
			remand the matter back to the CEO, SRA.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			81.
			<lb />
			Mr.Jagtiani would submit that the AGRC also considered
			<lb />
			submissions of the petitioner in respect to change in shareholding of
			<lb />
			respondent No.5 which were never made before the CEO, SRA or in the
			<lb />
			applications filed before the AGRC. It is submitted that as such the
			<lb />
			proceedings before the AGRC were in the nature of a continued trial
			<lb />
			where parties were heard de novo with respect to several issues,
			<lb />
			including those which were never raised before the CEO, SRA but were
			<lb />
			argued at the first instance before the AGRC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			82.
			<lb />
			Mr.Jagtiani has submitted that no prejudice was caused to
			<lb />
			the petitioner, in as much as the AGRC has given the petitioner and
			<lb />
			other parties sufficient opportunity to deal with all documents filed
			<lb />
			before the CEO, SRA. Referring to the decision of the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			Aligarh Muslim University &amp; Ors. vs. Mansoor Ali Khan 34 , it is submitted
			<lb />
			that mere lack of opportunity to be heard would not suffice and the
			<lb />
			same must be coupled with prejudice. It is submitted that no material
			<lb />
			has been furnished and no pleadings have been made by the petitioner
			<lb />
			with respect to prejudice suffered. It is thus contended that there is no
			<lb />
			prejudice to the petitioner on account of the CEO, SRA taking on record
			<lb />
			and considering the documents filed after the matter was closed after
			<lb />
			hearings.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			83.
			<lb />
			Mr. Jagtiani would next submit that apart from the above
			<lb />
			submissions, it is well settled that the interference of the Writ Court in
			<lb />
			Slum Rehabilitation matters must be limited to issues which remain
			<lb />
			unresolved despite the remedy of appeal being exhausted. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that in the present case, the dispute was fully and
			<lb />
			substantially heard and disposed of by the appellate authority namely
			<lb />
			the AGRC and no grievance is made that any dispute remains
			<lb />
			unresolved after the disposal of the said appeals. To support the
			<lb />
			submissions, reliance is placed on the full bench of this Court in
			<lb />
			Tulsiwadi Navnirman Coop. Housing Society Ltd. and Ors. vs. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra and Ors. 35 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			84.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the statutory scheme prescribed
			<lb />
			under the Slums Act expressly permits the change in shareholding of
			<lb />
			the developer appointed in respect of a slum rehabilitation area.
			<lb />
			Mr.Jagtiani has referred to Section 3V of the Slums Act which
			<lb />
			prescribes the power of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority to make
			<lb />
			regulations consistent with the Slums Act and the rules made
			<lb />
			thereunder, for all or any of the matters to be provided under the Slums
			<lb />
			Act by regulations and generally for all other matters for which
			<lb />
			provisions is, in the opinion of the SRA, necessary for the exercise of its
			<lb />
			35 2007(6) Mh.L.J. 851
			<lb />
			powers and the discharge of its functions under the Act. He refers
			<lb />
			Section 3A of the Slums Act which empowers the Slum Rehabilitation
			<lb />
			Authority to take necessary actions in order to achieve the object of
			<lb />
			rehabilitation of slums. It is submitted that the Slum Rehabilitation
			<lb />
			Authority in exercise of the aforesaid powers, had issued Office Order
			<lb />
			bearing No. SRA/CEO/office order 19/2015 dated 23 rd March 2015 in
			<lb />
			regard to &apos;Fees payable after change of Developer / Partner / Director
			<lb />
			while Implementing the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme&apos; (&quot;Office Order&quot;).
			<lb />
			It is submitted that this office order acknowledges and notes that
			<lb />
			&apos;Sometimes the Partnership Firm, Joint Venture or Company is totally
			<lb />
			replaced or taken over by new partners of Directors. The said Office
			<lb />
			Order also identifies at Clauses (II) to (IV) different categories of
			<lb />
			changes that may take place in the partnership firm/company which is
			<lb />
			undertaking the slum rehabilitation scheme. It is submitted that in
			<lb />
			order to effectively regulate the same, the office order requires the
			<lb />
			developer to intimate the said changes to the SRA and make payment
			<lb />
			of fees/charges for carrying out the same. The office order also
			<lb />
			prescribes for imposition of a fine on account of failure to intimate the
			<lb />
			said changes within the prescribed time. It is submitted that Clause (IV)
			<lb />
			of the said office order provides for intimation and payment of fees on
			<lb />
			account of retirement of any partner / Director proportionate to the
			<lb />
			share of incoming partners when the Developer is a partnership firm or
			<lb />
			a Private Limited Company / or LLP. Clause (IV) of the Office order
			<lb />
			therefore, permits change in shareholding of the developer on payment
			<lb />
			of charges as per Clause (I) of the office order. It is submitted that on a
			<lb />
			plain reading of the office order, it is clear that the office order under
			<lb />
			the Slums Act always permitted and continues to permit a change in
			<lb />
			the shareholding of the developer entity. It is submitted that it was
			<lb />
			never the case of respondent No.8 SLK Buildcon Pvt. Ltd. before the
			<lb />
			AGRC that change in controlling shareholding is not permitted under
			<lb />
			the Slums Act and rules and regulations made thereunder. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that on the contrary, as recorded in the impugned order
			<lb />
			dated 11 January 2018, it was respondent No.7&apos;s case that the change
			<lb />
			in shareholding is illegal in as much as it was not intimated to the SRA
			<lb />
			and for which applicable fees were not paid as per the said office order.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that it is also not the petitioner&apos;s case that the said office
			<lb />
			order is illegal or ultra vires the Slums Act and in fact, there is no
			<lb />
			challenge to the office order in these petitions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			85.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the purpose of the said office order was
			<lb />
			to regulate the change in partnership/directorship/shareholding of the
			<lb />
			developer, in respect of which there was an observable lacunae. It is
			<lb />
			thus submitted that the Slums Act read with the said office order
			<lb />
			permits the change in shareholding of the developer which is a private
			<lb />
			limited company. Mr.Jagtiani would submit that the office order
			<lb />
			clarifies the position in this regard and makes it expressly clear that
			<lb />
			change in shareholding is permitted by the developer who is required
			<lb />
			to intimate the fact of the change to the SRA. It is submitted that a
			<lb />
			failure to give such intimation within the prescribed time, does not
			<lb />
			result in the termination of the developer&apos;s right to continue with the
			<lb />
			slum rehabilitation scheme. This for the reason that Clause (I) of the
			<lb />
			office order prescribes the consequences of the failure to intimate such
			<lb />
			change i.e. a fine equal to five times the applicable charge. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that even Clause (VIII) makes it clear that the termination of
			<lb />
			a non-performing developer by the CEO, SRA is distinct from the ambit
			<lb />
			of the office order which only contemplates a fine to be paid for failure
			<lb />
			to make the said intimation. It is contended that in fact the fees
			<lb />
			payable for change in shareholding is linked to the percentage of
			<lb />
			shareholding which is undergoing change and a higher fee is recovered
			<lb />
			if there is a substantial change in the shareholding of the developer.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			86.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the corporate and legal identity of
			<lb />
			the developer, which is a private limited company, does not change on
			<lb />
			account of change in shareholding &apos;even if the same is a change of
			<lb />
			controlling shareholding&apos; of the developer. It is submitted that a change
			<lb />
			in the shareholding of the developer is not in derogation to the Slums
			<lb />
			Act and the same does not amount to a change in the developer which
			<lb />
			is prohibited except in accordance with Section 13 of the Slums Act. It
			<lb />
			is submitted that in the affidavit filed on behalf of SRA dated 17
			<lb />
			September 2018, it is categorically stated that respondent No.5 has
			<lb />
			submitted all relevant documents showing the change in shareholding
			<lb />
			for the purpose of issuance of Annexure III to the SRA and even as on
			<lb />
			date respondent No.5 is continuing to be on record of the SRA as
			<lb />
			developer for implementation of slum rehabilitation scheme on the
			<lb />
			subject property and transfer fee shall be recovered by SRA from
			<lb />
			respondent No.5 as per SRA Norms in respect of transfer of shares. It is
			<lb />
			thus submitted that as such the change in shareholding by the
			<lb />
			developer will not result in any revenue loss as submitted by the
			<lb />
			petitioner and the position in this regard is clearly covered by the Office
			<lb />
			Order. It is submitted that the statutory scheme prescribed under the
			<lb />
			Slums Act also permits the change in shareholding of the developer
			<lb />
			appointed with respect to a slum rehabilitation scheme, even after the
			<lb />
			consent is given by the society of slum dwellers.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			87.
			<lb />
			In the alternative de hors the office order dated 23 March
			<lb />
			2015, Mr. Jagtiani would submit that the change in shareholding of
			<lb />
			respondent No.5 does not amount to a change in the developer in
			<lb />
			respect of the slum rehabilitation scheme. In this context, it is
			<lb />
			submitted that in Section 3(B)(6) refers to a developer as including a
			<lb />
			company incorporated under the Companies Act, 2013. Any reference
			<lb />
			to a company under the Companies Act, 2013 necessarily means that
			<lb />
			under no circumstances can it be conferred with the identity of its
			<lb />
			shareholders. To support the submissions, reference is made to the
			<lb />
			decision of the Supreme Court in Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT 36 wherein it is
			<lb />
			held that the company is a juristic person and is distinct from the
			<lb />
			shareholders wherein the supreme Court has referred to Halsbury&apos;s
			<lb />
			Laws of England, Volume 6 (3 rd Ed.), page 234 as to the law regarding
			<lb />
			the attributes of shares.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			88.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that applying these general principles of
			<lb />
			corporate law, a company is (subject to very limited exceptions) a
			<lb />
			separate juristic person enjoying perpetual succession and where the
			<lb />
			developer is a company a mere change in shareholding does not alter
			<lb />
			the identity of the company i.e. the developer. It is submitted that a
			<lb />
			company registered under Indian legislation is entitled to alter its
			<lb />
			shareholding in the manner prescribed under the Companies Act, 2013
			<lb />
			and invite subscription to its shares. It is submitted that this is a
			<lb />
			prerogative of the company and is not expressly, or by necessary
			<lb />
			implication, restricted by the Slums Act. The Slums Act and the
			<lb />
			36 AIR 1955 S.C. 74
			<lb />
			statutory scheme prescribed thereunder, contemplates and permits
			<lb />
			companies to participate in the rehabilitation of slum areas, permits, by
			<lb />
			necessary implication, all corporate actions which a company is entitled
			<lb />
			to undertake. Thus it is submitted that there is a legal presumption
			<lb />
			that the legislature was presumed to be aware of the separate juristic
			<lb />
			status of a company which enjoys perpetual succession, and inferring
			<lb />
			an implied restriction to the change in shareholding under the Slums
			<lb />
			Act militates against the legal presumption in as much as if the
			<lb />
			legislature, being cognizant of this position, would have prohibited a
			<lb />
			change in controlling shareholding of a developer if that was its intent.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			89.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the contention as urged on behalf
			<lb />
			of the petitioner that the corporate veil be lifted to ascertain whether
			<lb />
			the separate legal entity of a company is being used to perpetrate a
			<lb />
			fraud or circumvent the application of applicable law, is misconceived.
			<lb />
			This for the reason that a change in shareholding of respondent No.5
			<lb />
			does not amount to a change of developer, either directly, or indirectly.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that such a change is not a fraud on the statute, i.e. the
			<lb />
			Slums Act. It is hence submitted that there is no merit in the
			<lb />
			petitioner&apos;s submission that there is a change in the identity of the
			<lb />
			developer or that the consent given to the developer stands vitiated on
			<lb />
			account of change in the shareholding of respondent No.5. It is
			<lb />
			accordingly submitted that on all these counts the petitions be rejected.
			<lb />
			Submissions on behalf of Respondent No.5 :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			90.
			<lb />
			Mr.Ravi Kadam, learned Senior Counsel for respondent
			<lb />
			No.5 has made the following submissions:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			91.
			<lb />
			Mr. Kadam at the outset, has argued on the object and
			<lb />
			intention of the Slums Act to contend that the intention of legislation is
			<lb />
			to make better provision for the improvement and clearance of slum
			<lb />
			areas in the State and their redevelopment and for protection of
			<lb />
			occupiers from eviction and distress warrants. Referring to the long
			<lb />
			title and the Preamble of the Act, it is submitted that the Slums Act is a
			<lb />
			social welfare legislation framed with the object of tackling and
			<lb />
			addressing the social evil of slums. It is submitted that the Slums Act is
			<lb />
			not permanent legislation, but a temporary measure enacted to solve
			<lb />
			such social problems. It is submitted that the object and nature of the
			<lb />
			Slums Act being a temporary measure, was first recognized by a
			<lb />
			Division Bench of this Court in State of Maharashtra vs. Shri Mahadeo
			<lb />
			Pandharinath Dhole and Others 37 . It is submitted that after 1991 and
			<lb />
			pursuant to the Afzalpurkar Committee, Chapter I-A was introduced
			<lb />
			into the Slums Act by Maharashtra Act IV of 1996 and was further
			<lb />
			37 AIR 1980 Bombay 348
			<lb />
			amended by Maharashtra Act VI of 1997. It is submitted that Section
			<lb />
			3A, which was brought under these amendments, contemplated the
			<lb />
			constitution of a Slum Rehabilitation Authority, which under Section
			<lb />
			3A(3) had expansive regulatory power to survey and review existing
			<lb />
			positions regarding slum areas; to formulate schemes for rehabilitation
			<lb />
			of slum areas; to get the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme implemented and
			<lb />
			to do all such other acts and things necessary for achieving the objects
			<lb />
			of rehabilitation of slums. It is submitted that DCR 33(10) was also
			<lb />
			introduced into the 1991 Development Control Regulations for
			<lb />
			providing additional incentives (FSI) for slum development, subject to
			<lb />
			the conditions therein and the conditions as set out in Appendix IV. It is
			<lb />
			thus submitted that looking at all these legislative developments, it is
			<lb />
			apparent that it always was (and more particularly after 1996), the
			<lb />
			Act&apos;s object to expedite and eventually complete the rehabilitation of
			<lb />
			slums at the earliest without any delay. It is submitted that for these
			<lb />
			reasons, the impugned actions must be assessed and tested by this
			<lb />
			Court, principally keeping in mind, the fact that the decisions in the
			<lb />
			present case were taken by the authorities in pursuance of the Act&apos;s
			<lb />
			objects of hastening slum eradication and rehabilitation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			92.
			<lb />
			In regard to the petitioner&apos;s contention that there was
			<lb />
			willful delay on the part of respondent no.5 in implementing the slums
			<lb />
			scheme, Mr.Kadam would submit that the case of the petitioner in this
			<lb />
			regard is unfounded and is appropriately rejected by both the
			<lb />
			Authorities below. It is submitted that between 2006 to 2008,
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 took steps to obtain individual and irrevocable consent
			<lb />
			from the members of the three societies and executed individual
			<lb />
			agreements as also obtained documents for draft Annexure II between
			<lb />
			2006 to 2008. In 2008 a proposal was submitted to SRA for
			<lb />
			implementing the composite scheme which was acted upon by the SRA
			<lb />
			in 2008. Thereafter respondent no.5 in pursuance of the desire of the
			<lb />
			members of adjoining plot to join the scheme, an application was made
			<lb />
			by respondent no.5 to the authorities for C.S. numbers for these
			<lb />
			unnumbered plots, and after allotment of C.S. numbers, a revised
			<lb />
			proposal for implementing a composite scheme to input new survey
			<lb />
			numbers (C.S.no.2124). This revised proposal and respondent no.5&apos;s
			<lb />
			mandate as developer for the revised scheme was ratified by all
			<lb />
			societies in separate general body meetings. SRA also acted upon this
			<lb />
			proposal and issued a report on the same and in turn the Deputy
			<lb />
			Collector and the competent authority issued Annexure II report which
			<lb />
			was forwarded to the SRA and thereafter to the Engineering
			<lb />
			Department in 2013. Respondent no.5 also took steps seeking rejection
			<lb />
			of the proposed D.P. Road as an effort to clear reservations. Thereafter
			<lb />
			on 6 June 2014, respondent no.5 applied for LOI which was in
			<lb />
			pursuance of respondent no.5&apos;s assurance that it would complete the
			<lb />
			work of redevelopment and for that it would obtain LOI for
			<lb />
			implementation of slum scheme latest by 30 June 2014. On respondent
			<lb />
			no.5&apos;s application for LOI on 6 June 2014, a draft was prepared on 23
			<lb />
			June 2014 and put up for approval of the Engineering Department on
			<lb />
			26 June 2014 and thus respondent no.5 was well on course to obtain
			<lb />
			LOI by 30 August 2014.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			93.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that realizing that if LOI is issued in favour
			<lb />
			of respondent no.5, the entire case of the petitioner on delay would be
			<lb />
			lost, the process was stymied and delayed by the petitioners themselves
			<lb />
			via a purported GBR dated 15 June 2014 by which the petitioner
			<lb />
			appointed SLK Buildcon/respondent no.7 and also complaints dated 18
			<lb />
			June 2014 and 27 June 2014 were made. It is submitted that as the
			<lb />
			draft LOI was approved which was in fact complete and pending since
			<lb />
			26 June 2014, the same was illegally deferred by the CEO, SRA with an
			<lb />
			erroneous direction to hold meetings to determine who should be the
			<lb />
			developer. It is submitted that the attempts were made to derail the
			<lb />
			composite scheme being submitted by the petitioner and delayed the
			<lb />
			implementation between June 2014 to February 2016. It is submitted
			<lb />
			that substantial time and effort of respondent no.5 was expended in
			<lb />
			proceedings before the Divisional Joint Registrar in 2014 and the writ
			<lb />
			proceedings arising from the order of the Divisional Joint Registrar
			<lb />
			from 2014. It is submitted that there were proceedings in 2014 before
			<lb />
			the HPC to set aside the CEO&apos;s illegal order dated 14 July 2014 to defer
			<lb />
			processing of respondent no.5&apos;s LOI and directions to hold meeting. It is
			<lb />
			further submitted that writ petitions were filed in 2015 seeking
			<lb />
			quashing of HPC&apos;s order dated 5 March 2015 which in turn had set
			<lb />
			aside the CEO&apos;s order of 14 July 2014 for deferral of respondent no.5&apos;s
			<lb />
			LOI proposal. It is submitted that even these writ petitions were
			<lb />
			dismissed. It is submitted that thereafter, second round of litigation
			<lb />
			was initiated by the petitioner under Section 13(2) before the CEO
			<lb />
			SRA. It is submitted that because of these intervening events,
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 could only obtain the LOI which was finally issued on
			<lb />
			5 February 2016 the approval of which was pending since 23 June
			<lb />
			2014. It is submitted that since nearly 70% of the eligible slum dwellers
			<lb />
			have acted in furtherance of the scheme and a substantial number of
			<lb />
			their structures, have been demolished and thereafter, environmental
			<lb />
			clearance and development permissions i.e., IOA and CC for rehab
			<lb />
			building for the scheme were also obtained. It is submitted that all
			<lb />
			these facts plainly demonstrate that respondent no.5 has taken concrete
			<lb />
			steps to complete the scheme and obtain the LOI. It is submitted that in
			<lb />
			fact it is the petitioner who had thwarted the scheme at the eleventh
			<lb />
			hour by the petitioner&apos;s meeting so convened on 15 July 2014 to
			<lb />
			appoint a rival developer and generated litigation which could be
			<lb />
			resolved only in a time period of two years. It is submitted that in
			<lb />
			these circumstances, there was no justifiable basis that would warrant
			<lb />
			termination of respondent no.5&apos;s appointment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			94.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the CEO SRA has rightly observed as
			<lb />
			under:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) In view of the CRZ notified area, the 60.80 mtrs. wide DP Road,
			<lb />
			the proposed metro line and available area being only 25% for
			<lb />
			rehabilitation
			<lb />
			(b) These constraints entailed that area available for actual
			<lb />
			construction on site was hardly sufficient for rehabilitation of eligible
			<lb />
			slum dwellers.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(c) That there was substance in the submission of respondent No.5
			<lb />
			that the June, 2014 termination was at the behest of the rival developer
			<lb />
			who wanted to takeover the subject SR Scheme after resolution of CRZ
			<lb />
			issue and that there was no willful delay on the part of respondent
			<lb />
			no.5.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(d) That in the facts of the case, the slum dwellers ought not to be
			<lb />
			allowed to revoke the consent since there is no wilful delay.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			95.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that these findings thereafter were
			<lb />
			considered by AGRC which was itself a body comprised of experts such
			<lb />
			as the Additional Municipal Commissioner, Vice President MHADA,
			<lb />
			Additional Chief Secretary, Housing Department etc. It is submitted that
			<lb />
			after considering the material on record and CEO&apos;s findings, the AGRC
			<lb />
			also reached a similar reasoned decision that there was no case for
			<lb />
			terminating respondent no.5&apos;s appointment. It is submitted that it is a
			<lb />
			possible view which has been taken by both the authorities and on this
			<lb />
			count the petition would not require any interference.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			96.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the petitioner has failed to make
			<lb />
			out a case to disturb the concurrent findings of fact under Article 226
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. This submission is being supported by contending
			<lb />
			that the petitioner whilst impugning these findings, does not suggest
			<lb />
			that these findings are perverse or they are such that no reasonable
			<lb />
			body of persons would arrive at. It is submitted that the thrust of the
			<lb />
			petitioner&apos;s case as borne out by record and from their submissions is
			<lb />
			that these findings are erroneous, and that the reservations were
			<lb />
			already present, when respondent no.5 was appointed as a developer. It
			<lb />
			is submitted that this contention of the petitioner is per se unfounded.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that these challenges are ex-facie challenges of fact and
			<lb />
			are ordinarily not entertained by the Court in exercising writ
			<lb />
			jurisdiction. It is submitted that in the teeth of concurrent findings that
			<lb />
			held that delay cannot be attributed to respondent no.5, such
			<lb />
			concurrent findings on facts ought not to be disturbed, unless a case is
			<lb />
			made out to establish perversity or that they evince conclusions that no
			<lb />
			reasonable body would arrive at. It is submitted that even insufficiency
			<lb />
			of evidence is not a basis for interdicting concurrent findings. This
			<lb />
			submission is being supported by relying on the decision of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in Union of India Vs. Mustafa 38 and in BSNL vs.
			<lb />
			Bhurumal 39 . It is submitted that the petitioner&apos;s reliance on Hi Tech
			<lb />
			India Construction Vs. SRA (supra) is misplaced since this judgment
			<lb />
			infact confirms that the High Court does not interfere in cases where
			<lb />
			concurrent findings of the SRA and HPC are based on possible views.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			97.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the petitioner&apos;s submissions that
			<lb />
			the CEO SRA was influenced by the HPC&apos;s order dated 29 February
			<lb />
			2015, is also incorrect and cannot be accepted. This for the reason that
			<lb />
			the CEO SRA considered the LOI report dated 23 June 2014 and
			<lb />
			thereafter recorded his own view. It is submitted that after considering
			<lb />
			these conditions, the CEO SRA was of the view that the scheme itself
			<lb />
			was not viable due to these hurdles. As it is submitted that as a passing
			<lb />
			remark, the CEO SRA has also remarked that a similar conclusion had
			<lb />
			also been drawn by the HPC in its earlier order of 29 February 2015. It
			<lb />
			is submitted that this passing observation was made in addition to his
			<lb />
			own findings and does not detract from his independent assessment
			<lb />
			carried out, as clearly seen from the CEO&apos;s order.
			<lb />
			Submissions on Natural justice :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			98.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the petitioner&apos;s contention that there is
			<lb />
			breach of principles of natural justice when the petitioner was not
			<lb />
			granted an opportunity to deal with three General Body Resolutions
			<lb />
			dated 3 May 2014 (of respondent no.8), dated 4 May 2014 (of
			<lb />
			respondent no.9) and 7 May 2014 (of the petitioner) is misconceived.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that there has been no breach of principles of natural
			<lb />
			justice, as also, this contention of the petitioner is false for the reason,
			<lb />
			since the CEO SRA has specifically recorded the fact that respondent
			<lb />
			no.5&apos;s counsel during his arguments, had made submissions on these
			<lb />
			three GBRs. It is submitted that whilst arguments were advanced by the
			<lb />
			learned Counsel on these GBRs during the hearing, copies of the same
			<lb />
			were only tendered pursuant to the CEO&apos;s directions after the hearing.
			<lb />
			This is clear from the observations as made by the CEO regarding the
			<lb />
			arguments as made on behalf of respondent no.5. It is thus submitted
			<lb />
			that the plea as urged on behalf of the petitioner that these issues were
			<lb />
			not argued is ex-facie false. It is submitted that the petitioner has
			<lb />
			disputed the factum of an oral direction being given by the CEO to
			<lb />
			submit the document, however, the petitioner has not disputed the
			<lb />
			specific case of respondent no.5 in the pleadings before the AGRC that
			<lb />
			it&apos;s counsel had made submissions and referred to and relied upon
			<lb />
			these three GBRs during the hearing before the CEO-SRA. The Court&apos;s
			<lb />
			attention in this regard is drawn to respondent no.5&apos;s reply dated 28
			<lb />
			July 2016 (page 1032 of the paper book) to contend that it has not
			<lb />
			been rebutted by the petitioner and reference is made to rejoinder
			<lb />
			affidavit dated 3 August 2016 paragraph 13 thereof (page 1140 of the
			<lb />
			paperbook). It is submitted that the CEO SRA recorded his findings
			<lb />
			that there was no willful delay upon an assessment of the facts of the
			<lb />
			scheme and the LOI report 14 July 2014. It is submitted that a plain
			<lb />
			reading of the CEO-SRA&apos;s order demonstrates that his findings, that
			<lb />
			there was no willful delay, were independent and not dependent on the
			<lb />
			May 2014 GBRs. It is submitted that even the AGRC&apos;s findings that
			<lb />
			there was no willful delay, are based on the other materials and not the
			<lb />
			May 2014 GBRs. Thus, there is no case made out for establishing de
			<lb />
			facto prejudice, necessary to claim a breach of principles of natural
			<lb />
			justice. To support this contention Mr.Kadam has relied on the decision
			<lb />
			in Haryana Financial Corporation &amp; Anr. Vs. Kailash Chandra 40 and on
			<lb />
			the decision in Aligarh Muslim University Vs. Mansoor Ali Khan 41 . It is
			<lb />
			submitted that GBRs were relied upon by the CEO, SRA to hold that the
			<lb />
			societies had purported to terminate in June 2014 at the rival
			<lb />
			developer&apos;s behest. It is next submitted that in May 2014, GBRs always
			<lb />
			formed a part of the SRA&apos;s record maintained in respect of the scheme
			<lb />
			and this position has been confirmed by the SRA in its affidavit in reply
			<lb />
			(paragraph 10) which has not been disputed. It is submitted that it is
			<lb />
			on this premise the CEO SRA was well within his rights even as a
			<lb />
			Planning Authority to consider and assess this material.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			99.
			<lb />
			It next submitted that the petitioner lacks locus to
			<lb />
			challenge the GBRs of 3 May 2014, 4 May 2014 since they relate to
			<lb />
			respondent nos.8 and 9, who support the scheme of respondent no.5.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			100.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that even before the HPC, the petitioner&apos;s
			<lb />
			substantive case on these May 2014&apos;s GBRs being fabricated, was vague
			<lb />
			as borne out by its written submissions. It is submitted that the
			<lb />
			petitioner&apos;s case that the May 2014 General Body Meetings were held
			<lb />
			inside respondent no.5&apos;s office at Hindu Colony, Dadar, is also contrary
			<lb />
			to the minutes of the General Body Meetings itself, which clearly state
			<lb />
			that the same were held on the ground floor of the said premises. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that the minutes, attendance register etc. are on record,
			<lb />
			hence, the allegations and submissions as made on behalf of the
			<lb />
			petitioner that the meetings never took place, are clearly erroneous,
			<lb />
			false and contrary to the record. It is next submitted that inspite of an
			<lb />
			opportunity being granted, the petitioner did not even attempt to
			<lb />
			dispute the authenticity of the other documents that is the documents
			<lb />
			other than 2014 General Body Resolutions of the petitioners and
			<lb />
			respondent nos.8 and 9 of the societies. Without prejudice it is
			<lb />
			submitted that apart form the case of inordinate delay in the Section
			<lb />
			13(2) application, the petitioner was also allowed to raise further
			<lb />
			contentions on alleged fraud in regard to GBRs of May 2014 and
			<lb />
			change in shareholding of respondent no.5 and the AGRC also decided
			<lb />
			these issues though the same could not be raised under Section 13(2)
			<lb />
			and were certainly not part of the show cause notice dated 20 April
			<lb />
			2016 issued by the CEO, SRA to respondent no.5. It is submitted that
			<lb />
			affidavits were filed during the period 7 July 2016 to 9 August 2017 by
			<lb />
			the parties before the AGRC in Application no.83 of 2016 and 220 of
			<lb />
			2016. Even on this count there can be no grievance that the
			<lb />
			proceedings were not substantive.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			101.
			<lb />
			Mr.Kadam, thereafter, has made extensive submission that
			<lb />
			reliance on behalf of the petitioner on the decision in L.K.Ratna (supra)
			<lb />
			is misconceived. Mr.Kadam&apos;s submission on this issue are similar to the
			<lb />
			submissions of Mr. Jagtiani. Mr. Kadam would add that L.K.Ratna
			<lb />
			(supra) was also distinguished by the Supreme Court in United
			<lb />
			Planters Vs. K.G.Sangameswaran 42 wherein the Supreme Court held
			<lb />
			that L.K.Ratna (supra) would not strictly apply in cases where the
			<lb />
			Appellate Authority could come to its own conclusion irrespective of
			<lb />
			the findings recorded in the domestic equity. Mr.Kadam would submit
			<lb />
			that in Jayantilal Vs. RBI 43 the Constitution Bench held that a post
			<lb />
			decisional hearing by the Appellate Authority was sufficient to cure an
			<lb />
			initial defect of non-grant of hearing. It is submitted that Partha Ghosh
			<lb />
			&amp; Anr. Vs. Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 44 was also the
			<lb />
			case of a Chartered Accountant which follows L.K.Ratna (supra). It is
			<lb />
			submitted that AGRC Rules,2014 enable the AGRC to do its own fact
			<lb />
			finding, and further entertain new points of fact. It is clear from Rule
			<lb />
			7(2) which enables the AGRC to call for any record or require
			<lb />
			attendance of any person to facilitate and expedite disposal of the
			<lb />
			Appeals. It is submitted that the AGRC is competent to call for records,
			<lb />
			persons and materials necessary to arrive at its own finding on facts.
			<lb />
			Rule 7(6) of the AGRC Rules,2014 enables the AGRC to exercise
			<lb />
			jurisdiction to entertain new points of facts. It is submitted that in the
			<lb />
			present case the AGRC has exercised its discretion in favour of the
			<lb />
			petitioner and permitted it to deal with the additional documents
			<lb />
			brought on record and additionally canvass new points of facts and law
			<lb />
			in appeal namely the alleged fraud in GBRs and change in
			<lb />
			shareholding. It is submitted that in all, 14 affidavits were filed before
			<lb />
			the AGRC. It is submitted that in these circumstances, the petitioner
			<lb />
			has clearly had a &apos;fair deal&apos; before the AGRC and can hardly contend a
			<lb />
			violation of the principles of natural justice.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			102.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that in any case it is well settled that an
			<lb />
			Appeal is a continuation of the trial proceedings as held in Kamla Devi
			<lb />
			V. Kushal Kanwar &amp; Anr. 45 and thus the Appeal Court / Authority can
			<lb />
			consider all the material at the trial stage as also the additional
			<lb />
			material produced at the appellate stage, as also subsequent events
			<lb />
			interalia to do complete justice between the parties, to enable the
			<lb />
			Appeal Court to pronounce judgment in a more satisfactory manner or
			<lb />
			for any other substantial cause. In making this submission, reliance is
			<lb />
			placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in North Eastern Railway
			<lb />
			Administration, Gorakhpur Vs. Bhagwan Das 46 and the decision in
			<lb />
			Pasupuleti Venkateswarlu Vs. The Motor &amp; General Traders 47 . It is
			<lb />
			submitted that the AGRC by allowing the petitioner to raise additional
			<lb />
			contentions such as fraud in the alleged GBRs and change in
			<lb />
			shareholding, has given every conceivable opportunity to the petitioner.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the petitioner has, therefore, failed to show a real
			<lb />
			prejudice to it and hence the contention about violation of principles of
			<lb />
			natural justice is completely misconceived, untenable and liable to be
			<lb />
			rejected. It is submitted that the petitioner&apos;s reliance on the decision of
			<lb />
			Suresh Dhanuka&apos;s case (supra), on the decision in Platinum Realty
			<lb />
			(supra), then on Associated Tubewells Ltd. Vs. Gujarmal Modi (supra),
			<lb />
			and the decision in Shantidevi Yadav Vs. State of Maharashtra (supra)
			<lb />
			are misplaced.
			<lb />
			SUBMISSIONS ON CHANGE IN SHAREHOLDING :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			103.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the fundamental fallacy in SLK
			<lb />
			Buildcon&apos;s argument is that the Slums Act does not forbid and/or
			<lb />
			prohibit the appointment of a company and/or corporate entity as a
			<lb />
			developer. It is submitted that the fact that the statute and the law
			<lb />
			permits a company to be appointed as a developer, itself indicates the
			<lb />
			State legislature&apos;s acceptance that a company enjoys a separate juristic
			<lb />
			identity as an artificial person with a common seal and perpetual
			<lb />
			succession. It is submitted that by law, it enjoys identity distinct from
			<lb />
			its shareholders, and further the transactions between the company and
			<lb />
			third parties are not transactions between the shareholders and third
			<lb />
			parties. To support this submission, reliance is placed on the decision in
			<lb />
			Bacha Guzdar Vs. CIT 48 and on the decision in Bakul Kapadia Vs. Bank
			<lb />
			of India 49 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			104.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the person who submitted the proposal
			<lb />
			and who has been issued an LOI remains the same namely respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 and thus the developer remains the same. It is submitted that the
			<lb />
			SRA has considered respondent no.5&apos;s application and considered it fit
			<lb />
			to implement the scheme.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			105.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the SRA has issued Office Order
			<lb />
			no.19/2015 dated 23 March 2015 and the subject of the order being
			<lb />
			&quot;fees payable after change of developer/partner/director whilst
			<lb />
			implementing the slum rehabilitation schemes.&quot; It is submitted that the
			<lb />
			subject itself establishes the order&apos;s purpose of collecting fees and not
			<lb />
			to accord permission. It further indicates that this order operates whilst
			<lb />
			the scheme is being implemented, and the implementation of the
			<lb />
			scheme only arises after issuance of the LOI. It is submitted that a bare
			<lb />
			reading of this order dated 23 March 2015, further establishes that
			<lb />
			changes in shareholding are to be intimated post facto to the SRA
			<lb />
			within 30 days, and there is no requirement to seek prior permission.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that failure to notify is met with a fine and not a refusal
			<lb />
			48 (1955)1 SCR 876
			<lb />
			49 (1994)1 Bom CR 313
			<lb />
			of permission or refusal to recognize changes. It is submitted that a
			<lb />
			failure to pay this fine is curable and not a defect that strikes at the root
			<lb />
			of the LOI. It is submitted that as and when the SRA raises a demand
			<lb />
			for premium on respondent no.5, it will pay the same to SRA. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that payment of premium as per the said order dated 23
			<lb />
			March 2015 is a matter entirely between the SRA and respondent no.5
			<lb />
			and the slum dwellers who merely have a right of rehabilitation, would
			<lb />
			thus have no concerned with the same. It is submitted that even the
			<lb />
			SRA confirms in paragraph 11 of its affidavit dated 17 September 2018
			<lb />
			that there is no restriction on transfer of shares. It is submitted that
			<lb />
			there is no challenge to this office order of CEO SRA dated 23 March
			<lb />
			2015 in the petition and in the absence of challenge it must be
			<lb />
			presumed to be valid and part of the statute. It is thus submitted that it
			<lb />
			is quite clear that there can be no basis for contending that there is a
			<lb />
			fraud on statute that is Slums Act, DCR 33(10) and Appendix IV when
			<lb />
			the same does not and cannot bar transfer of shares which is a subject
			<lb />
			matter within the exclusive domain of the Companies Act,1956.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			106.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the power to frame legislation
			<lb />
			regarding
			<lb />
			incorporation,
			<lb />
			regulation
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			winding
			<lb />
			up
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			companies/corporations being juristic entities, is exclusively conferred
			<lb />
			on Parliament under Entries 43 and 44 of List I to Schedule VII to the
			<lb />
			Constitution of India. On the other hand the State legislatures do not
			<lb />
			have any such powers under the List II or III of the Schedule VII to the
			<lb />
			Constitution of India. It is thus submitted that notwithstanding the
			<lb />
			absence of a bar, the Act must be interpreted keeping in mind the
			<lb />
			general principle that the State does not possess legislative competence
			<lb />
			to enact a bar that would override the Companies Act which provides
			<lb />
			for free transferability of shares. It is submitted that the case of the
			<lb />
			petitioner that there is an implied bar under the Slums Act, DCR
			<lb />
			33(10) and Appendix IV of the DC Regulations proceeds on a patent
			<lb />
			misreading of the Act.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			107.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the slum occupants do not have a right,
			<lb />
			title or interest in the land that is sought to be rehabilitated as a slum
			<lb />
			and also they do not possess a right to decide which society or
			<lb />
			developer implements the scheme, they only possess a right to a
			<lb />
			tenement. In supporting this, reliance is placed on paragraphs 12 and
			<lb />
			13 of the decision in Awdesh Tiwari V. CEO (supra). It is submitted that
			<lb />
			the petitioner-society and SLK Buildcon have failed to make out a case
			<lb />
			as to how a change in shareholding would defeat the rights of the slum
			<lb />
			occupants to tenements in the scheme.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			108.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the law is well settled that a bar
			<lb />
			on transfer should not be readily inferred especially when the transfer
			<lb />
			has no relevance or nexus to the object of the regulatory act in
			<lb />
			question. It is submitted that the bar on transfer operates as
			<lb />
			expropriatory legislation and must be strictly construed and it must be
			<lb />
			clear and unambiguous. It is submitted that the scheme under the LOI
			<lb />
			requires respondent no.5 to develop the slum area and the change in its
			<lb />
			shareholding would have no impact on this purpose. This submission is
			<lb />
			supported by referring to the decision in DLF Wutab Enclave Complex
			<lb />
			Educational Charitable Trust Vs. State of Harayana 50 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			109.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the SRA has confirmed that
			<lb />
			changes in shareholding were intimated to it alongwith Annexure III,
			<lb />
			and even the AGRC has arrived at such a finding. This is clear from the
			<lb />
			affidavit as filed on behalf of the SRA (page 2097) and also from
			<lb />
			paragraph 14 of the HPC order dated 11 January 2018. It is submitted
			<lb />
			that the allegation of the petitioner that the SRA mysteriously learnt of
			<lb />
			the same without being intimated amounts to an allegation that an
			<lb />
			office of the SRA colluded with respondent no.5, and such an allegation
			<lb />
			amounts to an allegation of personal malafides against the officer
			<lb />
			concerned. It is submitted that it is well settled that an enquiry into
			<lb />
			personal malafides cannot be carried out in the absence of the person
			<lb />
			50 (2003)5 SCC 622
			<lb />
			against whom the malafides are attributed and the malafides must also
			<lb />
			be established with cogent material and pleaded with material
			<lb />
			particulars. It is submitted that the petitioner has failed to do so. It is
			<lb />
			thus submitted that the allegations of malafides are bogus, afterthought
			<lb />
			and must be rejected in limine. In support of this contention, reliance
			<lb />
			is placed on the decision in State of Bihar Vs. P.P.Sharma 51
			<lb />
			110.
			<lb />
			Without prejudice to the aforesaid submissions, it is
			<lb />
			submitted that the Authority cannot travel beyond the allegations of
			<lb />
			the show cause notice and expand the scope of the proceedings. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that in the present case, the SRA issued a show cause notice
			<lb />
			dated 20 April 2016 to seek an explanation on the cause for delay, and
			<lb />
			thus the case for change of shareholding traveled beyond the notice
			<lb />
			and must be ignored. In support of this submission, reliance is placed
			<lb />
			on the decision in Bhor Industries Vs. Union 52 ; Babubhai Patel Vs.
			<lb />
			Collector of Customs 53 ; Nirmal Realtors vs. SRA 54
			<lb />
			111.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the allegations and issue relating to a
			<lb />
			change in shareholding were first raised by the Petitioner in its appeal
			<lb />
			and through an additional affidavit filed after the institution of its
			<lb />
			51 (1992) Supp (1) SCC 222
			<lb />
			52 (2011)266 ELT 444
			<lb />
			53 (1993)68 ELT 734
			<lb />
			54 2017 SCC Online Bom 9201
			<lb />
			appeals. It is submitted that no reason or cause was supplied for
			<lb />
			making these new allegations in appeal. It is submitted that even the
			<lb />
			AGRC application no.83 of 2016 filed by the petitioner to challenge the
			<lb />
			LOI was on the ground of delay only and not on the ground of change
			<lb />
			of shareholding. It is submitted that further, the prayer in application
			<lb />
			no.83 of 2016 seeking quashing and setting aside of LOI was
			<lb />
			specifically on the ground of inordinate delay of 9 years. It is thus
			<lb />
			submitted that thus plainly this issue was beyond the scope of the
			<lb />
			original proceedings and considering the legal position, it must be
			<lb />
			ignored.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			112.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the petitioner has sought to pitch
			<lb />
			a case that the slum occupants had reposed faith in the original
			<lb />
			shareholders. It is submitted that there is no such case pleaded either
			<lb />
			before the CEO-SRA or before the AGRC. It is submitted that every
			<lb />
			document has been executed with respondent no.5 and further more
			<lb />
			such an inquiry would proceed on disputed questions of fact that
			<lb />
			cannot be gone into under Article 226 of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			113.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that SLK Buildcon has sought to pitch a
			<lb />
			case that Clause 43 of the development agreement forbids changes in
			<lb />
			respondent no.5&apos;s shareholding which is plainly misconceived as SLK
			<lb />
			has no locus to rely on the development agreement, and further the
			<lb />
			petitioner itself has not made submissions on this count. It is submitted
			<lb />
			that lastly the clause itself does not constitute a bar to a change in
			<lb />
			shareholding. It is submitted that, in fact a majority of the slum
			<lb />
			dwellers in the scheme, have vacated their structures including 237
			<lb />
			eligible members out of 402 eligible members of the petitioner society
			<lb />
			and the scheme is being implemented and these events have taken
			<lb />
			place inspite of changes in the shareholding which itself reflects that
			<lb />
			slum dwellers per-se have no objection.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			114.
			<lb />
			It is next contended that reliance on behalf of SLK
			<lb />
			Buildcon-respondent no.7 on the decision in Susme Builders Pvt.Ltd.
			<lb />
			Vs. CEO SRA &amp; Ors. (supra) is misplaced as in the said case inspite of
			<lb />
			being granted LOI in the year 1995, the developer had not
			<lb />
			implemented the scheme for nearly 23 years. It is submitted that in
			<lb />
			this context where willful delay had already been found, the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court held that the developer had not bothered to implement the
			<lb />
			scheme but instead carried out changes in shareholding.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			115.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the petitioner is estopped
			<lb />
			considering the provisions of the development agreement dated 17
			<lb />
			October 2006 from making a prayer for carving out. A reference in
			<lb />
			that regard is made to Clause 5 of the agreement and to Clause 14 of
			<lb />
			the agreement, to contend that the office bearers and members of the
			<lb />
			petitioner-society had requested respondent no.5 to undertake a slum
			<lb />
			rehabilitation work. It is submitted that by virtue of Clause 5 of the
			<lb />
			agreement, all the recitals would form inseparable part of the
			<lb />
			agreement. It is submitted that Clause 14 specifically provides that
			<lb />
			there can be no objection from the members of the said societies for
			<lb />
			transfer / assignment of the benefits thereunder by the developer in
			<lb />
			favour of any third party. It is submitted that Clause 19 gives right to
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 to implement the scheme through its own funds or
			<lb />
			taking financial assistance from third party. It is thus submitted that
			<lb />
			after having agreed to the terms and conditions, the petitioner cannot
			<lb />
			approbate and reprobate by contending that the shareholders of
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 could not have sold their shares to third parties, and
			<lb />
			such change in shareholding amounts to change of developer and for
			<lb />
			this reason respondent no.5 ought to be removed as a developer.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			116.
			<lb />
			Mr.Kadam has also made submissions in regard to
			<lb />
			maintainability of these proceedings contending that the proceedings
			<lb />
			filed by the petitioner pursuant to the Managing Committee Resolution
			<lb />
			dated 26 March 2014 are not maintainable. According to Mr.Kadam,
			<lb />
			the petitioner has pleaded ex facie false and misleading case.
			<lb />
			Mr.Kadam has submitted that on 26 March 2016 the managing
			<lb />
			committee of the petitioner held a meeting to ratify the purported GBR
			<lb />
			dated 15 June 2014. It is submitted that by the said resolution dated 26
			<lb />
			March 2016 it was interalia resolved by the Managing Committee to
			<lb />
			appoint Mr. Mohammed Farooq Abdul Razzaque Kazi to make an
			<lb />
			application under Section 13(2) to the CEO SRA to challenge the LOI
			<lb />
			dated 5 February 2016 before the HPC and to appoint SLK Buildcon
			<lb />
			Pvt.Ltd. as a new developer. It is submitted that thus the Managing
			<lb />
			Committee decision dated 26 March 2016 has been deliberately sought
			<lb />
			to be portrayed as GBR dated 26 March 2016. It is therefore,
			<lb />
			submitted that the petitioner has not come to Court with clean hands
			<lb />
			and with Suppressio Veri Suggestio Falsi and therefore, is not entitled
			<lb />
			to any discretionary and equitable reliefs under Article 226 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			117.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the application under Section
			<lb />
			13(2) of the Slums Act can be only filed if the GBR is passed in that
			<lb />
			regard. It is submitted that in the present case, the application is filed
			<lb />
			on the basis of the Managing Committee Resolution dated 26 March
			<lb />
			2016 by the Honorary Secretary, hence, at the best it is a
			<lb />
			petition/proceedings filed by any individual slum dweller who is the
			<lb />
			elected secretary of the petitioner to the management committee
			<lb />
			resolution dated 26 March 2016 which not not maintainable in law. It
			<lb />
			is further submitted that the petitioner&apos;s reliance on GBR dated 15 June
			<lb />
			2014 is clearly misconceived as the same was held to be invalid as held
			<lb />
			in paragraph 10 of the order dated 5 March 2015 passed on Application
			<lb />
			No.3 and 4 of 2015 as confirmed by this Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			118.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the petitioner has realised that it
			<lb />
			cannot rely on the management committee&apos;s resolution and therefore,
			<lb />
			falsely couched the same as GBR in the proceedings for change of
			<lb />
			developer under Section 13(2).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			119.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that it was a matter of record that the
			<lb />
			general body meeting dated 15 June 2016 was convened and held in
			<lb />
			contravention of law and without authorised representative to be
			<lb />
			present and thus the resolution passed in the said meeting was wholly
			<lb />
			illegal and a nullity. It is further submitted that it is well settled that
			<lb />
			the contention of validity of the decision that is null and void can be set
			<lb />
			up wherever and whenever it is sought to be enforced or relied upon,
			<lb />
			even at the stage of execution and even in collateral proceedings. It is
			<lb />
			thus submitted that the proceedings initiated by the petitioner on the
			<lb />
			basis of GBR dated 15 June 2014 are without lawful authority. It is
			<lb />
			therefore, submitted that application no.83 of 2016 filed under Section
			<lb />
			13(2), GBR dated 5 April 2016 and Application no.110 of 2016 were
			<lb />
			liable to be ignored on this ground alone.
			<lb />
			Submission on General Body Resolution dated 7 th May-2014 :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			120.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the LOI dated 5 February 2016 was
			<lb />
			issued by SRA to respondent no.5 on the basis of proposal dated 27
			<lb />
			August 2008 and revised proposal dated 4 December 2009 which were
			<lb />
			submitted on the basis of GBRs of all the three societies held in 2006
			<lb />
			and 2009, stated to be the first and second GBR&apos;s respectively, as also
			<lb />
			the individual consents given by 658 out of 804 eligible slum dwellers
			<lb />
			which constituted 81.84% in favour of respondent no.5. That the
			<lb />
			petitioner has not challenged the GBRs of 2006 and 2009 as also the
			<lb />
			individual consent as given by the slum dwellers. The LOI report
			<lb />
			clearly refers to the proposal dated 27 August 2008 and 4 December
			<lb />
			2009 as also to the said individual consents. It is submitted that for
			<lb />
			this reason the challenge in application No. 83 of 2016 as also in the
			<lb />
			present petition to the LOI dated 5 February 2016 on the basis of
			<lb />
			alleged fraud in the GBRs of May-2014 is misconceived and untenable.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			121.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the petitioner lacks locus to
			<lb />
			challenge the GBRs dated 4 May 2014 and 3 May 2014 of respondent
			<lb />
			nos. 8 and 9. These GBRs admittedly do not pertain to the petitioner
			<lb />
			who is solely assailing this GBRs. Respondent nos. 8 and 9 whose
			<lb />
			resolutions have been challenged by the petitioner have no grievance as
			<lb />
			they are supporting the implementation of the rehabilitation scheme
			<lb />
			being undertaken by respondent no.5.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			122.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the challenge to GBR dated 7 May
			<lb />
			2014 of the petitioner could not have been raised directly before the
			<lb />
			AGRC, but was required to be challenged in proceeding before a proper
			<lb />
			forum.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			123.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the petitioner&apos;s challenge to its own
			<lb />
			GBR dated 7 May 2014 is not only misconceived and untenable but the
			<lb />
			same is false and frivolous. This for the reason that by November-2017
			<lb />
			the AGRC proceedings were closed for orders, at which point of time
			<lb />
			237 eligible members out of 402 eligible members of the petitioner (i.e.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			58.96% members) had accepted the rent by cheque from respondent
			<lb />
			no.5. Further 385 members out of petitioner&apos;s 671 total members
			<lb />
			which includes the eligible, ineligible and undecided members (which
			<lb />
			amounted to 57.38% members) had also accepted rent cheques from
			<lb />
			respondent no.5. It is submitted that this is a fact which has been
			<lb />
			recorded by the AGRC in the impugned order dated 11 January 2018 in
			<lb />
			para no. 16. It is submitted that in any case there is no challenge in the
			<lb />
			petition to the said findings of the AGRC which clearly shows the
			<lb />
			overwhelming support to the scheme enjoyed by respondent no.5.
			<lb />
			Hence, the challenge to the LOI dated 5 February 2016 on the basis of
			<lb />
			alleged fraud in the GBR dated 7 May 2014 is liable to be rejected.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			124.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the General Body Meetings of May,
			<lb />
			2014 of all the three societies in fact took place on 3 May 2014, 4 May
			<lb />
			2014 and 7 May 2014 respectively in compound of the building Ganesh
			<lb />
			Bhuvan, Plot no. 71, Hindu Colony, Dadar (East), Mumbai. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that the minutes of attendance register etc. were on record
			<lb />
			of the SRA. Hence, the allegations of the petitioner that meetings
			<lb />
			never took place is incorrect, false and contrary to the record. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that the minutes of the said 3 GBRs of May, 2014 were duly
			<lb />
			submitted to the SRA in 2014 and were part of the SRA records. This is
			<lb />
			also confirmed in para 10 of the affidavit dated 17 September 2018
			<lb />
			filed by Mr. Padmakar Rokade, Deputy Collector, SRA in the present
			<lb />
			petition. Thus, the submissions of the petitioner that the 3 GBRs of
			<lb />
			May, 2014 never took place as the GBRs surfaced for the first time on 9
			<lb />
			May 2016 as the same were not relied upon in Writ Petition No. 8410
			<lb />
			of 2014 is false and frivolous. It is submitted that due to inadvertence
			<lb />
			the said three GBRs of May, 2014 were not referred or brought on
			<lb />
			record of the earlier proceedings. Nonetheless, the same were on
			<lb />
			record of the SRA.
			<lb />
			Alternatively and without prejudice to the above
			<lb />
			submissions, it is submitted that the petitioners challenge to the GBR
			<lb />
			dated 7 May, 2014 is on three grounds. Firstly, that the meetings
			<lb />
			allegedly took place in the office of the developer. Secondly, that eight
			<lb />
			persons out of 206 members had signed twice which indicated foul play
			<lb />
			and thirdly, that signature of 2 persons were on the document who are
			<lb />
			apparently deceased.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			125.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the allegations of the petitioner were
			<lb />
			dealt by respondent nos. 8 and 9 in para 17 and 18 of the affidavit both
			<lb />
			dated 18 August 2017, filed before the AGRC wherein respondent nos.
			<lb />
			8 and 9 stated that the legal heirs of deceased members had attended
			<lb />
			the said meetings and sign on the attendance registers and hence there
			<lb />
			was no fraud as alleged by the petitioner. It is submitted that also in
			<lb />
			para 24 of the affidavit dated 6 August 2016, filed by respondent no.5
			<lb />
			before the AGRC as also in paras 66 to 71 of the written submissions
			<lb />
			filed before the AGRC, it was submitted that respondent no.5 had no
			<lb />
			role to play in holding the said GBRs and that, in any event, the legal
			<lb />
			heirs of the eligible members would be allotted rehabilitation
			<lb />
			tenements.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			126.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that in any case 2 out of 4 dead persons
			<lb />
			were the members of the petitioner namely Ms. Lily A. Koli and Ms.
			<lb />
			Rukaiya Begum. It is thus submitted that the petitioner has no locus to
			<lb />
			make allegations about two other dead persons Mr. Mujib Hasan Khan
			<lb />
			and Mr. Prakash Govind Tamore who were members of respondent nos.
			<lb />
			8 and 9 respectively. It is next submitted that the alleged case of fraud
			<lb />
			in GBRs before the AGRC of about 4 persons is being improvised to 26
			<lb />
			persons in this petition as seen from list of dates submitted on behalf
			<lb />
			of the Petitioner in Writ Petition No.2349 of 2018 which is
			<lb />
			impermissible in law. A factual issue of such nature cannot be pleaded
			<lb />
			for the first time in writ petition and which has amounted to
			<lb />
			improvising the case at subsequent stage by the petitioner, when the
			<lb />
			same was not pleaded before the AGRC nor it pleaded in the Writ
			<lb />
			Petition, but directly in the list of dates. As such allegations do not
			<lb />
			form part of the writ petition, the respondent no.5 had no chance
			<lb />
			contesting such a case even in the arguments.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			127.
			<lb />
			In the alternative it is submitted that the petitioner does
			<lb />
			not have locus to challenge GBRs of respondent nos.8 and 9 on the
			<lb />
			basis of allegations that about 21 persons out of the 26 persons are not
			<lb />
			members of petitioner. This for the reason that respondent nos. 8 and
			<lb />
			9 are supporting the scheme being undertaken by respondent no.5.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			128.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that in any case the allegations which
			<lb />
			are made by the petitioner in regard to these persons whether being
			<lb />
			members of the petitioner&apos;s or not and the allegations of fraud and
			<lb />
			forgery are required to be pleaded with material particulars. The
			<lb />
			petitioner is required to establish who committed the alleged
			<lb />
			fraud/forgery in what manner. On vague allegations, that eight
			<lb />
			signatures are appearing twice is insufficient to allege case of forgery
			<lb />
			against respondent no.5 and to allege that it has fabricated documents.
			<lb />
			In supporting to the submissions reliance is placed on the decision of
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in Bishundeo Narain Vs. Seogeni Rai 55 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			129.
			<lb />
			The next submission is that the General Body meetings
			<lb />
			pertaining to the said GBRs were held in the compound of the building
			<lb />
			Ganesh Bhavan and not in the office of respondent no. 5 on the 1 st floor
			<lb />
			of Ganesh Bhavan, as alleged by the petitioner. It is submitted that at
			<lb />
			the relevant time, the office of respondent no. 5 was admittedly on the
			<lb />
			1 st floor of the said building. In this context, it is submitted from the
			<lb />
			55 AIR 1951 SC 280
			<lb />
			reading of the minutes of General Body meetings dated 3 rd May, 2014,
			<lb />
			4 th May, 2014 and 7 th May, 2014 of respondent nos. 9 and 8 and of the
			<lb />
			petitioner, clearly show that the same were not held in the office of
			<lb />
			respondent no. 5 on the 1 st floor of the building, but on the ground
			<lb />
			floor, i.e., compound of the said building. It is submitted that the
			<lb />
			General Body Meetings were held on 3 rd May, 2014, 4 th May, 2014 and
			<lb />
			7 th May, 2014 and were attended by the respective members of these
			<lb />
			Societies. It is submitted that hence all the 800 eligible members never
			<lb />
			attended the meeting on one day. These meetings were independently
			<lb />
			held on these different dates, and the compound of the said property
			<lb />
			was sufficient to hold the said meetings. Hence, the allegation of the
			<lb />
			petitioner and more particularly as made in the submissions that it was
			<lb />
			not possible for the meetings to be held in the registered office of
			<lb />
			respondent no. 5, as the same was not large enough to accommodate
			<lb />
			all 800 eligible members of the said three Societies, is clearly erroneous
			<lb />
			and contrary to record.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			130.
			<lb />
			In the alternate, it is submitted that in impugning only 12
			<lb />
			signatures, namely, 5 persons signing twice plus the signatures of two
			<lb />
			dead persons, the petitioner has accepted the signatures of the
			<lb />
			remaining members on the GBR dated 7 th May, 2014 of the petitioner-
			<lb />
			society. It is submitted that at the best the grievance of the petitioner
			<lb />
			can be that the consent of 12 persons must be disregarded in a GBR
			<lb />
			unanimously passed by all the members present and voting. Thus, the
			<lb />
			doubts cast by the petitioner on the holding of the GBMs of May 2014
			<lb />
			of the three Societies are clearly misconceived and are required to be
			<lb />
			rejected.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			131.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the GBRs dated 11 th May, 2014 and 15 th
			<lb />
			June, 2014 of respondent no. 8 and the petitioner and the GBR dated
			<lb />
			22 nd June, 2014 of respondent no. 9 as passed in the said meetings
			<lb />
			convened by the purported meeting conveners were also subject matter
			<lb />
			of challenge in Application Nos. 3 of 2015 and 4 of 2015. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that the High Power Committee by its order dated 5 th March,
			<lb />
			2015 held the said GBR&apos;s to be illegal and invalid. It is submitted that
			<lb />
			the said orders of H.P.C. were also upheld by this Court in its judgment
			<lb />
			dated 21 st September, 2015 passed in Writ Petition No.673 and 674 of
			<lb />
			2015, and the said judgment of this Court has attained finality, as the
			<lb />
			same was not challenged. It is submitted that consequently there was
			<lb />
			no requirement in law for respondent no.5 to once again get
			<lb />
			respondent no. 5&apos;s appointment confirmed in as much as once the GBRs
			<lb />
			dated 11 th May, 2014, 15 th June, 2014 and 22 nd June, 2014 were held to
			<lb />
			be illegal, the purported termination was of no consequence and hence
			<lb />
			a status quo ante, namely, the status prior to General Body Resolutions
			<lb />
			dated 11 th May, 2014, 15 th June, 2014 and 22 nd June, 2014 was
			<lb />
			restored. It is submitted that in fact after the elections of the three
			<lb />
			Societies held in March 2016, if the said three Societies wanted to
			<lb />
			terminate the appointment of respondent no. 5 and to appoint
			<lb />
			respondent no. 7-SLK Buildcon in respondent nos. 5&apos;s place, then it was
			<lb />
			statutorily incumbent for these Societies to pass fresh General Body
			<lb />
			Resolutions in that behalf and that too by following a procedure
			<lb />
			namely requiring the presence of the representative of the Assistant
			<lb />
			Registrar SRA as per circular no.169 dated 31 st December, 2015 (Page
			<lb />
			1139 of the compilation of documents-IV). It is submitted, however,
			<lb />
			thereafter the petitioner&apos;s General Body did not pass a resolution but
			<lb />
			the Managing Committee passed the resolution dated 26 th March, 2016
			<lb />
			thereby purporting to reiterate the General Body Resolution dated 15 th
			<lb />
			June, 2014 of the petitioner-society which was already declared to be
			<lb />
			illegal and invalid by the High Power Committee and which orders
			<lb />
			were upheld by this Court. It is, therefore, submitted that the challenge
			<lb />
			to the LOI and the Application under section 13(2) by the petitioner on
			<lb />
			the basis of resolution of the Managing Committee dated 26 th March,
			<lb />
			2016 were clearly untenable in law and were rightly rejected.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			132.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that in fact the AGRC in the impugned order
			<lb />
			dated 11 th January, 2018 in paragraph 16 has clearly observed that
			<lb />
			during the pendency of the matter before HPC, 644 structures of the
			<lb />
			occupants were demolished and that out of these 644 demolished
			<lb />
			structures, structures of 205 occupants were of the members of the
			<lb />
			petitioner-society.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			133.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that respondent no. 5 or respondent nos. 8
			<lb />
			and 9 are not justifying the impugned order dated 11 th January, 2018
			<lb />
			passed by AGRC on the basis of affidavits filed by these respondents
			<lb />
			before the AGRC or in this Court and for this reason, the decision of
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in Mohinder Singh Gill &amp; Anr. (supra) would not be
			<lb />
			applicable in this circumstances. It is submitted that the doctrine of
			<lb />
			proportionality is now well settled and the Courts have held that
			<lb />
			administrative actions or quasi judicial decisions can be tested on the
			<lb />
			touchstone of doctrine of proportionality. To support this contention,
			<lb />
			reliance is placed on the decision of Supreme Court in Om Kumar &amp;
			<lb />
			Ors. Vs. Union of India 56 and in the case of Johnson and Johnson vs.
			<lb />
			State 57 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			134.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that the GBR of May 2014 is not the
			<lb />
			basis of issue of LOI dated 5 th February, 2016. In this context, it is
			<lb />
			submitted that even assuming without admitting that 12 signatures of
			<lb />
			the petitioner&apos;s members are irregular or vitiated, the Court certainly
			<lb />
			possesses the discretion to sever and disregard the same from the
			<lb />
			signatures appended to the attendance sheet of the GBR dated 7 th May,
			<lb />
			2014 especially since the said GBR did not lead to issuance of LOI
			<lb />
			dated 5 th February, 2016. It is submitted that the said LOI was issued
			<lb />
			pursuant to the LOI Report dated 14 th July, 2014, which itself refers to
			<lb />
			the proposals dated 27 th August, 2008 and 4 th December, 2009 which
			<lb />
			were submitted in pursuance to the GBR of 2006 and 2009 and
			<lb />
			consents of 658 out of 804 eligible slum dwellers, i..e, about 81.84% to
			<lb />
			the Slum Redevelopment Scheme of respondent no. 5. It is thus
			<lb />
			submitted that the consent held by respondent no. 5 was more than the
			<lb />
			required minimum of 70% and thus minor irregularities and infirmities
			<lb />
			in GBR of May 2014 (which do not lead to the LOI) do not vitiate the
			<lb />
			scheme. In supporting this submission, reliance is placed on the
			<lb />
			decision of Supreme Court in Balasaheb Arjun Torbole vs.
			<lb />
			Administrator 58 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			135.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that GBRs of May 2014 are not the
			<lb />
			only basis of which the impugned order dated 17 th May, 2016 of CEO,
			<lb />
			SRA or the order dated 11 th January, 2018 of AGRC are passed.
			<lb />
			Therefore, the challenge to the LOI and the impugned orders must fail.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			58 (2015) 6 SCC 534
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			136. Submissions on Reliefs under Article 226 of the Constitution :-
			<lb />
			Mr. Kadam learned senior counsel for respondent no. 5 has
			<lb />
			made submissions on the reliefs as prayed for in the present petition
			<lb />
			and the reasons these reliefs ought not to be granted. It is submitted
			<lb />
			that grant of reliefs in this Petition would entail a complete destruction
			<lb />
			of the scheme and cause a manifest injustice to the members of
			<lb />
			respondent nos. 8 and 9 and majority of the members of the petitioner.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the slum scheme in question is being implemented
			<lb />
			in respect for one large slum spread on 3 contiguous plots of land
			<lb />
			bearing CS Nos. 1500 (pt.), 2116 (pt.) and 2124 of Mahim Division
			<lb />
			totally admeasuring about 20,465.72 sq. Mtrs. Situate at Mahim (Est),
			<lb />
			Mumbai. It is submitted that the said property belongs to the
			<lb />
			Government of Maharashtra. It is submitted that out of 1263 slum
			<lb />
			dwellers thereon, as of September, 2018, 808 slum dwellers are found
			<lb />
			eligible for rehabilitation under the Slums Act read with Regulation
			<lb />
			33(10) of Development Control Regulation 1991. The Court&apos;s attention
			<lb />
			is drawn to the prayers as made by the petitioner before the CEO, SRA
			<lb />
			and the AGRC to submit that the prayers as made would establish that
			<lb />
			the real purpose for the petitioner is to break the composite scheme in
			<lb />
			order to have a plot of land carved out therefrom and destroy the
			<lb />
			whole composite scheme or at least delay the same, for reason best
			<lb />
			known to the petitioner. It is submitted that the prayer of the petitioner
			<lb />
			throughout, before the authorities below as also this Court is to carve
			<lb />
			out a plot of land from LOI issued in favour of respondent no. 5 which
			<lb />
			is contrary to the statutory scheme to rehabilitate entire slum area at a
			<lb />
			stretch and not piecemeal over individual plots which is borne out
			<lb />
			from. Firstly, the provision of Section 4(1) of the Slums Act which
			<lb />
			would provide that rehabilitation of slums is area specific and not plot
			<lb />
			specific. Secondly, Clauses 1.3 and 1.15 of Appendix IV of DCR, 1991,
			<lb />
			as applicable to the present scheme, contemplate implementation of
			<lb />
			slum scheme over a viable stretch at one place. It is submitted that the
			<lb />
			idea was to have entire area rehabilitated at a stretch as opposed to
			<lb />
			piecemeal rehabilitation as canvassed by the petitioner. It is submitted
			<lb />
			that this would also result in better town planning/layout, which is
			<lb />
			again in larger public interest. In making the submission, reliance is
			<lb />
			placed on the decision of Supreme Court in Balasaheb Tarbole (supra).
			<lb />
			It is submitted that carving out of the property as sought by the
			<lb />
			petitioner would cause manifest injustice to all the occupants as since
			<lb />
			November 2017 nearly 70% of the occupants had already acted in
			<lb />
			furtherance of the composite scheme as envisaged. It is thus submitted
			<lb />
			that discretion under Article 226 ought not to be exercised in cases
			<lb />
			where a majority of slum dwellers have vacated their structures which
			<lb />
			have been demolished. Any interference in this stage would be
			<lb />
			manifestly against the interests of the occupants whose structures have
			<lb />
			been demolished and who are awaiting the completion of the scheme.
			<lb />
			In support of this submission, reliance is place on the decision of
			<lb />
			Division Bench of this Court in Vasant Kheraj Bhanushali vs. Goregaon
			<lb />
			Siddharth Nagar Sahakari 59 . It is submitted that the decision is
			<lb />
			applicable with full force, as in the present case during the pendency of
			<lb />
			the matter before the AGRC, 644 structures of occupants were
			<lb />
			demolished and of these demolished structures, structures of 205
			<lb />
			occupants of the petitioner were also demolished. It is submitted that
			<lb />
			by August, 2018, 896 occupants out of 1263 occupants (eligible and
			<lb />
			ineligible), i.e., 70.94% have accepted rent from respondent no. 5. It is
			<lb />
			further submitted that these occupants have allowed their structures to
			<lb />
			be demolished in further to the composite scheme under the LOI and
			<lb />
			who are now awaiting completion of the scheme. Hence, interference
			<lb />
			at this stage at the behest of the petitioner would be manifestly against
			<lb />
			the interests of all these occupants and against public interest and the
			<lb />
			objects of the Slums Act. For this reason, even interim order dated 13 th
			<lb />
			April, 2018 passed by this Court in present Writ Petitions directing that
			<lb />
			respondent no. 5 cannot claim equities would not circumscribe, the
			<lb />
			Court&apos;s discretionary jurisdiction to consider whether the passing of any
			<lb />
			adverse order would be contrary and manifestly against the interests of
			<lb />
			59 (2011) 3 Mh. L.J. 433
			<lb />
			the occupants whose structures are demolished and who are awaiting
			<lb />
			completion of the scheme.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			137.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that even otherwise the petitioner lacks the
			<lb />
			requisite majority for change of developer. It is thus submitted that for
			<lb />
			change of developer, a requisite majority of 70% of the slum&apos;s eligible
			<lb />
			occupants must give their consent and even when such majority
			<lb />
			support is obtained, the proposal for change must be considered and
			<lb />
			assessed by the SRA to determine what is in the best interest of all
			<lb />
			these stakeholders including the occupants especially on a contiguous
			<lb />
			stretch of land. To support this argument, reference is made to
			<lb />
			Appendix IV Clause 1.15 of DCR, 1991, and the decision of the Division
			<lb />
			Bench of this court in Lokhandwala Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra (supra) (paragraphs 10 and 15). It is submitted that the
			<lb />
			Division Bench has held that proposals for change of developer must be
			<lb />
			strictly assessed in order to ensure that managing committees of
			<lb />
			societies do not further their own interests. It is submitted that the
			<lb />
			ratio in this decision is squarely applicable to the present case since the
			<lb />
			Petition has been filed on the basis of a purported Managing Committee
			<lb />
			Resolution dated 16 th March, 2016. It is thus submitted that while
			<lb />
			examining the case for changing the developer, discretion and
			<lb />
			jurisdiction under Article 226 must be exercised in favour of the larger
			<lb />
			public interest of all the occupants and stakeholders.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			138.
			<lb />
			It is next submitted that in the matter of planning, the
			<lb />
			Court must give greater deference to the views of Planning Authority
			<lb />
			(SRA) and also AGRC whose members are having requisite knowledge/
			<lb />
			expertise and experience to decide the matters of development and
			<lb />
			planning and the views expressed by such competent authorities in a
			<lb />
			decision may not be interfered in writ jurisdiction. To support this
			<lb />
			submission, reliance is placed on the decision of Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			Anand Buttons vs. State of Haryana 60 .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			139. Submissions on behalf of respondent nos.8 and 9 (Nav Kiran CHS
			<lb />
			and Hind Ekta CHS) :-
			<lb />
			Mr.Shyam Mehta, the learned senior counsel for
			<lb />
			respondent nos.8 and 9 at the outset submits that the respondent nos.8
			<lb />
			and 9 have no intention to change respondent no.5 as the developer for
			<lb />
			the project. Mr. Mehta has referred to a list of dates pointing out
			<lb />
			complete sequence of events in the list of dates submitted by him, to
			<lb />
			submit that at all material times respondent no.8 and 9 as a society
			<lb />
			intended to support development only at the hands of respondent no.5.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			60 (2005) 9 scc 164
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the GBRs and all applications made on behalf of the
			<lb />
			respondent nos.8 and 9 as being pointed out by the petitioner are not
			<lb />
			the actual resolutions or any decisions of the GBRs of respondent nos.8
			<lb />
			and 9. It is his submission that the contention of the petitioner that on
			<lb />
			11 May 2014 meeting was held of respondent no.8 and 9 to terminate
			<lb />
			appointment of respondent no.5 and appoint respondent no.7 SLK
			<lb />
			Buildcon as a new developer, is totally misconceived in as much as
			<lb />
			these meetings were not convened by the Chief Promoters of the
			<lb />
			society but were purportedly convened by some disgruntled members
			<lb />
			of respondent nos. 8 and 9. It is further submitted that purportedly
			<lb />
			meetings were not held in accordance with circular No. 80 dated 15
			<lb />
			February 2008, in as much as they were not held in the presence of the
			<lb />
			Authorized Representative of the Assistant Registrar, SRA.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			proceedings were also not video-graphed. Also notices convening
			<lb />
			alleged meetings at no point of time were placed on record. Event the
			<lb />
			attendance sheet does not bear address of venue, date and time of the
			<lb />
			purported meetings. It is his submissions that the CEO-SRA as also the
			<lb />
			AGRC has appropriately recorded reasons to reject the applications of
			<lb />
			the petitioner filed under section 13(2) of the Slums Act. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that the contentions urged on behalf of the petitioner that
			<lb />
			application filed by the petitioner under section 13(2) was
			<lb />
			maintainable as there is no requirement of consent of 70% of the Slums
			<lb />
			developers under the circular dated 15 February 2008 is a misconceived
			<lb />
			and narrow interpretation of the said circular. Mr. Mehta has also
			<lb />
			drawn my attention to application pointing out location of the each
			<lb />
			plots. He has also drawn attention to the intervention application filed
			<lb />
			on behalf of the respondent no.8 before the Chief Executive Officer, to
			<lb />
			submit that right from inception respondent no.8 has taken a position
			<lb />
			that the case of the petitioner to change respondent no.5 as a
			<lb />
			developer, is untenable. It is submitted that in the present case the
			<lb />
			scheme is required to be considered in its entirety and the concurrent
			<lb />
			findings as recorded by the both authorities in rejecting 13(2)
			<lb />
			application would not warrant any interference. Mr. Mehta&apos;s
			<lb />
			submissions on all the other counts are similar to the ones made by Mr.
			<lb />
			Kadam learned senior counsel for respondent no.5 and more
			<lb />
			particularly as to how in the facts and circumstances of the case the
			<lb />
			slum re-development in question is required to be considered as a
			<lb />
			composite scheme, as rightly dealt by both the authorities below in
			<lb />
			rejecting the petitioner&apos;s application and appeal respectively.
			<lb />
			Questions for determination :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			140.
			<lb />
			On the above conspectus, whether the petitioner was
			<lb />
			entitled for change of a developer under the provisions of Section 13(2)
			<lb />
			of the Slums Act, would require determination of the following
			<lb />
			questions:-
			<lb />
			(I)
			<lb />
			Whether the findings and conclusion of the CEO-SRA and
			<lb />
			the AGRC, that the requirement of consent of 70% slum dwellers
			<lb />
			agreeing for redevelopment of slums in question, stood complied, qua
			<lb />
			the slum redevelopment proposal, submitted by respondent no.5 on
			<lb />
			behalf of the petitioner and respondent nos.8 and 9, can be said to be
			<lb />
			perverse and illegal ?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(II)
			<lb />
			Whether transfer of shareholding in respondent No.5 by
			<lb />
			Shenghanis in favour of Porwals and by Porwals in favour of
			<lb />
			M/s.Omkar Realtors, would amount to induction of a new developer
			<lb />
			contrary to the statutory procedure to appoint a new developer; and/or
			<lb />
			whether it would amount to illegal sale of a slum scheme by one
			<lb />
			developer to another ?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(III)
			<lb />
			Whether the concurrent findings of the CEO-SRA and the
			<lb />
			AGRC that there is no delay/willful delay on the part of respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 in implementing the slum scheme, can be said to be perverse and
			<lb />
			illegal, so as to warrant an approval under Section 13(2) of the Slums
			<lb />
			Act to change respondent no.5 as a developer ?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(IV)
			<lb />
			Whether the orders passed by the Chief Executive Officer-
			<lb />
			SRA on the petitioner&apos;s application under Section 13(2) and as
			<lb />
			confirmed by the AGRC, are in any manner vitiated on the ground of
			<lb />
			breach of principles of natural justice ?
			<lb />
			Reasons and Conclusions :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			141.
			<lb />
			To answer the above questions, it would be necessary to
			<lb />
			note the relevant statutory background which concerns slum
			<lb />
			redevelopment and implementation of slum schemes.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			142.
			<lb />
			The State Legislature with an object to make better
			<lb />
			provision for improvement and clearance of slum areas in the State and
			<lb />
			their redevelopment enacted the Maharashtra Slum Areas
			<lb />
			(Improvement, Clearance And Redevelopment) Act, 1971 (&apos;Slums Act&apos;).
			<lb />
			Chapter I-A of the Slums Act provides for slum rehabilitation scheme,
			<lb />
			under which Section 3A provides for appointment of a Slum
			<lb />
			Rehabilitation Authority by the State Government which shall be body
			<lb />
			corporate having perpetual succession and common seal with power to
			<lb />
			contract, acquire, hold and dispose of property, both movable and
			<lb />
			immovable, and to do all things necessary for the purposes of Slums
			<lb />
			Act and which may sue and be sued by its corporate name. Sub-section
			<lb />
			(3) of Section 3A provides for the following powers, duties and
			<lb />
			functions of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(a) to survey and review existing position regarding slum areas;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(b) to formulate schemes for rehabilitation of slum areas;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(c) to get the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme implemented;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(d) to do all such other acts and things as may be necessary for
			<lb />
			achieving the objects of rehabilitation of slums.
			<lb />
			Section 3A sub-section (5) of the Slums Act provides that the SRA may
			<lb />
			appoint Committees consisting of its members and experts to facilitate
			<lb />
			its working and &quot;speedy implementation of the scheme prepared under
			<lb />
			section 3B of the Act.&quot; Section 3B of the Slums Act, provides for
			<lb />
			preparation of a general slum rehabilitation scheme for the areas
			<lb />
			specified under sub-section (1) of Section 3A for rehabilitation of slums
			<lb />
			and hutment colonies in such areas. Sub Section (4) of Section 3B
			<lb />
			provides for the parameters for declaration of any area as the slum
			<lb />
			rehabilitation area and the parameters and the manner in which it can
			<lb />
			be provided therefor. Section 3C is the power of the Chief Executive
			<lb />
			Officer after publication of slum rehabilitation scheme to declare the
			<lb />
			slum rehabilitation area. Section 4 provides for a declaration of an area
			<lb />
			as &quot;slum areas&quot;, when the competent authority is satisfied any area is
			<lb />
			or may be a source of danger to the health, safety or convenience of the
			<lb />
			public of that area or of its neighborhood, by reason of the area having
			<lb />
			inadequate or no basic amenities, or being insanitary, squalid,
			<lb />
			overcrowded or otherwise; or the buildings in any area, used or
			<lb />
			intended to be used for human habitation are in any respect, unfit for
			<lb />
			human habitation; or by reasons of dilapidation, overcrowding, faulty
			<lb />
			arrangement and design of such buildings, narrowness or faulty
			<lb />
			arrangement of streets, lack of ventilation, light or sanitation facilities
			<lb />
			or any combination of these factors, detrimental to the health, safety or
			<lb />
			convenience of the public of that area, in such a situation the
			<lb />
			Competent Authority may, by notification in the Official Gazette,
			<lb />
			declare such area to be a slum area by following the procedure.
			<lb />
			Chapter III of the Slums Act provides for slum improvement. Chapter
			<lb />
			IV provides for slum clearance and redevelopment under which Section
			<lb />
			13 which is a relevant provision which would provide for change of the
			<lb />
			developer in case the redevelopment is not being undertaken within the
			<lb />
			time. As the basic controversy in the present proceedings falls under
			<lb />
			this provision it would be appropriate to extract the said provision
			<lb />
			which reads thus:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Section 13. Power of Competent Authority to redevelop clearance
			<lb />
			area
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>

			<lb />
			the work of redevelopment of that land has been commenced by the
			<lb />
			owner, by order, determine to redevelop the land at its own cost, if that
			<lb />
			Authority is satisfied that it is necessary in the public interest to do so.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2) Where land has been cleared of the buildings in accordance with a

			<lb />
			contravention of plans duly approved, or any restrictions or conditions
			<lb />
			imposed under sub-section (10) of section 12, or has not been

			<lb />
			provisions of the Development Control Regulations for Greater
			<lb />
			Bombay,1991 are required to be noted as these provisions concern the

			2.7
			<lb />
			Where there is no builder-developer but the Project is

			3.14 Amalgamation/Subdivision Of Plots and Balancing Of FSI
			<lb />
			Thereon :
			<lb />
			Any land declared as slum rehabilitation area or on which slum
			<lb />
			rehabilitation project has been sanctioned , if it is spread on part or

		<p>
			3.15 Boundaries and the measurement of plot areas of the Slum
			<lb />
			Rehabilitation Area shall be declared by the competent authority after

			<lb />
			A &quot;Schedule&quot; has been incorporated in Appendix IV to
			<lb />
			provide for &apos;Policy Guidelines for the Development Plan of Grater
			<lb />
			Bombay for implementation of lands allocated to various users
			<lb />
			designated/reserved sites occupied by slums&apos;. These guidelines have
			<lb />
			categorized the lands situated in Bombay which are under slums,
			<lb />
			falling under different zones and the purpose for which the land under
			<lb />
			the development plan are intended to be used.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			146.
			<lb />
			Further a procedure for submission, processing and
			<lb />
			approval of slum rehabilitation scheme has been notified, to provide
			<lb />
			that all slums and pavements whose inhabitants&apos; names and structures
			<lb />
			appeared in the electoral roll prepared with reference to 1 January
			<lb />
			1995 or a date prior thereto and who are actually occupants of the
			<lb />
			hutments are eligible for the slum rehabilitation scheme. Clause (2) of
			<lb />
			the Procedure provides for 70% or more of the eligible hutment-
			<lb />
			dwellers in a slum or pavement in a viable stretch at one place, have to
			<lb />
			show their willingness to join Slum Rehabilitation Scheme and come
			<lb />
			together to form a co-operative housing society of all eligible hutment-
			<lb />
			dwellers, through a resolution to that effect. As there is some relevance
			<lb />
			and as this procedure was adopted in the present case, it would be
			<lb />
			apposite to note this procedure as contained in Clauses 1 to 15 which
			<lb />
			read thus:-
			<lb />
			Procedure for submission, processing and approval of Slum
			<lb />
			Rehabilitation Schemes:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;1. All slums and pavements whose inhabitants&apos; names and structures
			<lb />
			appear in the electoral roll prepared with reference to 1-1-1995 or a
			<lb />
			date prior thereto and who are actual occupants of the hutments are
			<lb />
			eligible for the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			2.
			<lb />
			70% or more of the eligible hutment-dwellers in a slum or
			<lb />
			pavement in a viable stretch at one place have to show their willingness
			<lb />
			to join Slum Rehabilitation Scheme and come together to form a
			<lb />
			cooperative housing society of all eligible hutment-dwellers through a
			<lb />
			resolution to that effect. The following resolution should be adopted:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(a) Resolution electing a chief promoter.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(b) Resolution giving the chief promoter authority to apply for
			<lb />
			reservation of name for cooperative housing society.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(c) To collect share capital (Rs.50/-per member for slum societies) and
			<lb />
			Re 1/-as entrance fee and to open account in Mumbai District Central
			<lb />
			Cooperative/Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank Ltd. (any branch)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			3. The chief promoter, office-bearers and the members of the proposed
			<lb />
			Society should collect the documents such as 7/12 extract and the PR
			<lb />
			card of the plot on which the slum is situate. They should then get the
			<lb />
			plot surveyed/measured and prepare map of the plot showing slum
			<lb />
			structures therein with the help of surveyors attached to the office of
			<lb />
			Additional Collector (Encroachment) or the Deputy Collector
			<lb />
			(Encroachment) of the zone.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			4. While undertaking the survey, they should collect the information of
			<lb />
			the proposed members/slum-dwellers and fill up land occupied by the
			<lb />
			slum-dwellers, number and type of structures such as residential,
			<lb />
			industrial, commercial, amenity structures, etc. and the list of eligible
			<lb />
			and ineligible occupants and consent of the slum-dwellers to join the
			<lb />
			Scheme. Earlier the promoter /cooperative housing society had to first
			<lb />
			approach the different competent authorities namely Additional
			<lb />
			Collector for the slums on government and private lands and the land-
			<lb />
			owning authorities for the slums on different public authority lands,
			<lb />
			for obtaining certified Annexure II, before they could put in application
			<lb />
			for Slum Rehabilitation Scheme to SRA. As a simplification measure,
			<lb />
			this procedure is now discontinued and Annexure II format is now
			<lb />
			required to be filled by the promoter /cooperative housing society itself
			<lb />
			for submitting building proposal to SRA, so that the scrutiny of the
			<lb />
			proposal and certification of Annexure II can start simultaneously.
			<lb />
			Annexure II needs to be submitted in duplicate. As a measure of
			<lb />
			further simplification, Additional Collector (Encroachment) is being
			<lb />
			designated as the sole competent authority for deciding eligibility and
			<lb />
			for taking eviction action against non-participants in Slum
			<lb />
			Rehabilitation Schemes.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			5. The chief promoter and the office-bearers of the proposed society
			<lb />
			should then apply for name reservation of the proposed cooperative
			<lb />
			housing society along with the self-prepared Annexure II and the
			<lb />
			required resolutions to the Assistant Registrar of Cooperative Societies.
			<lb />
			To facilitate this, office of the Assistant Registrar has been started in
			<lb />
			SRA itself. It is no longer necessary to approach different offices of the
			<lb />
			Cooperation Department for this purpose. The Assistant Registrar/SRA
			<lb />
			will issue a letter reserving the name for the proposed cooperative
			<lb />
			housing society and permission to open a bank account in the
			<lb />
			proposed society&apos;s name.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			6. While the above steps are being taken, the decision to search a
			<lb />
			competent developer to act as a promoter has to be taken up by the
			<lb />
			proposed cooperative housing society of slum-dwellers. The society
			<lb />
			itself or an NGO/developer/owner can take up Slum Rehabilitation
			<lb />
			Scheme as a promoter.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			7. The promoter so chosen has to enter into an agreement with every
			<lb />
			eligible slum-dweller while putting up slum rehabilitation proposal to
			<lb />
			SRA for approval. SRA is in the process of trying to evolve standard
			<lb />
			formats for the following four types of agreements required in the
			<lb />
			Scheme, with the approval of the State Government.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(a) Consent-cum-agreement between the promoter and the slum-
			<lb />
			dwellers.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(b) Development rights/agreement to lease between the promoter and
			<lb />
			the land-owning authority.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(c) Lease agreement between the land-owning authority and the
			<lb />
			cooperative society of slum-dwellers.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(d) Lease agreement between the land-owning authority and the
			<lb />
			cooperative society of free-sale tenement buyers.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			8. The promoter has also to appoint an architect in consultation with
			<lb />
			the proposed cooperative housing society of slum-dwellers to prepare
			<lb />
			the plans of development of the slum area as per DCR-33(10). It is
			<lb />
			expected that the architect ensures community participation in
			<lb />
			preparation of the building plans. All required documents such as
			<lb />
			building plan, layout plan, PR card, etc. along with Annexure I,
			<lb />
			Annexure II and Annexure III are to be submitted to SRA by the
			<lb />
			architect along with an application for the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme.
			<lb />
			A checklist of all such documents required for submission is available in
			<lb />
			SRA office.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			9. Annexure-I gives details about ownership of land, details of plot
			<lb />
			area, details of existing hutments and their type, computation of
			<lb />
			tenement density, extent and type of reservations, amenities, FSI
			<lb />
			available, number of tenements to be constructed including calculation
			<lb />
			of TDR etc.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			10. Annexure III is prescribed to assess the financial capability of the
			<lb />
			promoter. The items contained in Annexure III are self-explanatory.
			<lb />
			Keeping in view the sensitivity of this information, it is kept strictly
			<lb />
			confidential by SRA.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			11. After a pre-security by a designated engineer of SRA, to ensure
			<lb />
			completeness of the proposal submitted, so far as documents are
			<lb />
			concerned, proposals are accepted. Then a computerised file number is
			<lb />
			allotted to the Scheme on payment of scrutiny fees which are charged
			<lb />
			at half (sic) file number is allotted to the Scheme on payment of
			<lb />
			scrutiny fees which are charged at half the rate of the Municipal
			<lb />
			Corporation&apos;s general building permission fees. Upon acceptance, the
			<lb />
			scrutiny of Annexures I, II and III start simultaneously in the Building
			<lb />
			Permission Wing, Eligibility Certification Wing and Accounts &amp; Finance
			<lb />
			Wing respectively.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			12.
			<lb />
			Earlier, Letter of Intent conveying approval to the scheme,
			<lb />
			approval to the layout, building-wise plan approval (Intimation of
			<lb />
			Approval) and Commencement Certification were different stages of
			<lb />
			approval in the scheme, each having a long validity period. To speed
			<lb />
			up the actual commencement of building construction work on site,
			<lb />
			architects have been advised to submit slum rehabilitation proposals
			<lb />
			complete in all respects to enable SRA to give all the four approvals, at
			<lb />
			least for the first rehabilitation building, at one go. The validity period
			<lb />
			of the approval has been reduced from one year to 3 months. Circular
			<lb />
			number 4 dated 27 th August, 1997 has been issued by SRA detailing the
			<lb />
			simplified procedure (Appendix-D).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			13.
			<lb />
			In the slum rehabilitation scheme, the promoter is required to
			<lb />
			deposit Rs.20,000/-per rehabilitation tenement with SRA as per the
			<lb />
			time-schedule laid down by Chief Executive Officer of SRA. Promoter is
			<lb />
			also required to pay an amount of Rs.840/-per sq.m. for the built-up
			<lb />
			area over and above the normally permissible FSI, for the rehabilitation
			<lb />
			and free-sale tenements.
			<lb />
			After elaborate discussions with all
			<lb />
			concerned, suitable deferments on the statutory payments and
			<lb />
			flexibility in the installments of such payments have been provided by
			<lb />
			SRA. (Circular No. 7 dated 25 th November, 1997 is at Appendix-E).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			14.
			<lb />
			Providing temporary transit accommodation to the slum-
			<lb />
			dwellers, during the construction of rehabilitation and free-sale
			<lb />
			tenements, is the responsibility of the promoter. SRA facilitates
			<lb />
			obtaining constructed transit tenements, if available, by recommending
			<lb />
			the same for allotment to MHADA. SRA also helps in getting no
			<lb />
			objection certificates from public authorities on nearby identified public
			<lb />
			authority lands, for putting up temporary transit structures. These
			<lb />
			structures are required to be demolished and cleared after completion
			<lb />
			of the slum rehabilitation scheme.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			15.
			<lb />
			While applying for occupation certificate of rehabilitation
			<lb />
			building, the architect is expected to give the details of tenements
			<lb />
			allotments, done by the cooperative society by drawing lots, in the joint
			<lb />
			names of the head of the household (pramukh) and his/her spouse.
			<lb />
			SRA will generate computerised identity cards in the joint names of
			<lb />
			pramukh and spouse and hand over the same to each allottee family.
			<lb />
			The card will clearly mention that the rehabilitation tenements cannot
			<lb />
			be sold/leased/assigned or transferred in any manner for ten years
			<lb />
			(except to legal heirs) and tenements illegally transferred will be taken
			<lb />
			over by SRA. Any change of allotment within the members of the
			<lb />
			cooperative society, has also to be with the prior permission of SRA.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			147.
			<lb />
			The format for submitting the scheme as per modified DCR
			<lb />
			33(10) is contained in Appendix &quot;C&quot; at Annexure I which interalia
			<lb />
			requires the details of existing hutments to be set out alongwith
			<lb />
			statement of details of area of each commercial establishment, the
			<lb />
			documentary evidence for different commercial tenements or any other
			<lb />
			amenities like school, gymnasium, religious structures etc. Also an area
			<lb />
			statement providing for area of the plot, deduction for set back area,
			<lb />
			proposed road, deduction of fiscal provision, buildable/non buildable
			<lb />
			deduction, deduction for 5% amenities open space to arrive at no plot
			<lb />
			area is required to be set out. There is a separate column for
			<lb />
			computation of rehabilitation free sale area. Clause 27 of the said form
			<lb />
			provides for cost of the project to be set out. Next is Annexure II which
			<lb />
			is a certificate issued by the Competent Authority who can be the Ward
			<lb />
			Officer of MCGM or a Chief Officer of MHADA or the Deputy Collector
			<lb />
			(Encroachment) certifying the area as contained in the C.S.Number to
			<lb />
			be a censused slum colony of Municipal / Mhada/ Government record
			<lb />
			or is notified as slum under Section 4(1) of the Slums Act, or is
			<lb />
			declared a slum at a private land under Section 4(1) of the Slums Act.
			<lb />
			The total number of structures which are protected as per the
			<lb />
			Government policy and who will be eligible for free alternate
			<lb />
			accommodation as per DC Regulation 33(10). The classification of
			<lb />
			these slum dwellers into residential and commercial and also a
			<lb />
			certification of the percentage of the slum dwellers who have consented
			<lb />
			for slum rehabilitation scheme. It also provides for list of hutment
			<lb />
			dwellers and the other details such as carpet area for commercial user
			<lb />
			as appended to the said survey. Annexure III is the proforma to be
			<lb />
			submitted for the assessment of the financial capabilities of the
			<lb />
			developer to execute the slum rehabilitation scheme and would require
			<lb />
			particulars to be submitted in regard to item 1.11 as set out in
			<lb />
			proforma.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			148.
			<lb />
			From the provisions of the Slums Act and the above rules
			<lb />
			and regulations, it can be clearly seen that the object and intention is to
			<lb />
			provide to the slum dwellers at large a decent roof over their head by
			<lb />
			removing them from unhygienic slums which is the basic necessity for a
			<lb />
			normal human existence. This is also the constitutional scheme. It
			<lb />
			would be necessary to note the observations of the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			Shantistar Builders vs. Narayan K. Totame &amp; Ors., 61 in which the
			<lb />
			61(1990) 1 SCC 520
			<lb />
			Supreme Court held that difference between the need of an animal and
			<lb />
			a human being for shelter has to be kept in view. For an animal it is the
			<lb />
			bare protection of the body, for a human being it has to be a suitable
			<lb />
			accommodation which would allow him to grow in every aspect -
			<lb />
			physical, mental and intellectual. This is also the theme which would
			<lb />
			flow from different provisions of the Slums Act namely to ameliorate
			<lb />
			the pathetic and miserable condition of the slum dwellers and to ensure
			<lb />
			that the slum dwellers residing in such unhygienic and inhabitable
			<lb />
			conditions are granted a decent shelter. The Supreme Court in the said
			<lb />
			decision although in the context of the Urban Land (Ceiling and
			<lb />
			Regulation) Act, which was also a social welfare legislation, in
			<lb />
			paragraphs 9 and 10 has observed thus:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;9. Basic needs of man have traditionally been accepted to be three-
			<lb />
			food, clothing and shelter. The right to life is guaranteed in any
			<lb />
			civilized society. That would take within its sweep the right to food,
			<lb />
			the right to clothing, the right to decent environment and a reasonable
			<lb />
			accommodation to live in. The difference between the need of an
			<lb />
			animal and a human being for shelter has to be kept in view. For the
			<lb />
			animal it is the bare protection of the body; for a human being it has
			<lb />
			to be a suitable accommodation which would allow him to grow in
			<lb />
			every aspect -physical, mental and intellectual. The Constitution aims
			<lb />
			at ensuring fuller development of every child. That would be possible
			<lb />
			only if the child is in a proper home. It is not necessary that every
			<lb />
			citizen must be ensured of living in a well-built comfortable house but
			<lb />
			a reasonable home particularly for people in India can even be mud-
			<lb />
			built thatched house or a mud-built fire-proof accommodation .
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			10. With the increase of population and the shift of the rural masses to
			<lb />
			urban areas over the decades the ratio of poor people without houses
			<lb />
			in the urban areas has rapidly increased. This is a feature which has
			<lb />
			become more perceptible after independence. Apart from the fact that
			<lb />
			people in search of work move to urban agglomerations, availability of
			<lb />
			amenities and living conveniences also attract people to move from
			<lb />
			rural areas to cities. Industrialisation is equally responsible for
			<lb />
			concentration of population around industries. These are feature
			<lb />
			which are mainly responsible for increase in the homeless urban
			<lb />
			population, Millions of people today live on the pavements of different
			<lb />
			cities of India and a greater number live animal like existence in
			<lb />
			jhuggis.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			149.
			<lb />
			Similarly the Division Bench of this Court in &quot;The State Of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra vs Mahadeo Pandharinath Dhole&quot; 62 made the following
			<lb />
			observations:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;A dream situation would, of course, be total absence of any slums.
			<lb />
			But there seems to be a long way to go to realize the same. In the
			<lb />
			meanwhile, slums have arisen and do crop up. Necessity knows no
			<lb />
			law. But to accept these slums as they are would be the very negation
			<lb />
			of the duties of a modern welfare State. Since overnight clearance of
			<lb />
			slums appears to be a problem beyond the immediate reach of the
			<lb />
			State and the State Legislature has rightly chosen the next rest step
			<lb />
			viz. to regulate and control the slums and to see to it that these do not
			<lb />
			become a source of danger to health, safety and convenience not only
			<lb />
			of the slum dwellers but also the surrounding areas and to also see to
			<lb />
			it that these do not become a source of nuisance to the public.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			150.
			<lb />
			The endevour of the Court would be to decide these
			<lb />
			petitions on the touchstone of the above legal principles and the
			<lb />
			provisions of law so as to ascertain as to whether the impugned orders
			<lb />
			warrant any interference.
			<lb />
			Some admitted facts in regard to the slum scheme in question :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			151.
			<lb />
			Having noted the statutory complexion and the various
			<lb />
			facets relevant for a slum rehabilitation scheme, some admitted facts
			<lb />
			are required to be noted so as to answer the issues which have fell for
			<lb />
			62 AIR 1980 Bom 348
			<lb />
			determination.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			152.
			<lb />
			The land is notified as slums under Section 4 of the Slums
			<lb />
			Act and the subject matter of the slum rehabilitation scheme is the land
			<lb />
			in C.S.No.1500 (pt), 2166 (pt) and 2124 (pt) of Mahim Division
			<lb />
			admeasuring 20465.74 sq.meters and owned by the State Government.
			<lb />
			It is also not in dispute that there were 1263 slum dwellers. It is also
			<lb />
			not in dispute that the slum dwellers have formed three proposed
			<lb />
			societies namely the petitioner-New Janta SRA CHS Ltd., respondent
			<lb />
			no.8-Nav Kiran CHS and respondent no.9-Hind Ekta CHS, out of which
			<lb />
			400 slum dwellers are found to be eligible for providing alternate
			<lb />
			accommodation from the petitioner-society, 204 slum dwellers from
			<lb />
			respondent no.8-Nav Kiran CHS and 200 slum dwellers from
			<lb />
			respondent no.9-Hind Ekta CHS. In all about 804 slum dwellers are
			<lb />
			found to be eligible, who are residing on these notified slums. That the
			<lb />
			petitioner, respondent nos.8 and 9 societies have passed separate
			<lb />
			general body resolutions dated 3 June 2006, 9 June 2006 and 15 June
			<lb />
			2006 appointing respondent no.5 as a developer and respondent no.6
			<lb />
			as an architect to implement the slum rehabilitation scheme. It is also
			<lb />
			not in dispute that respondent no.5 was formerly incorporated on 19
			<lb />
			September 2006, that is three months after the resolutions were passed
			<lb />
			in the general body meeting of these three societies. Thereafter a
			<lb />
			development agreement dated 17 October 2016 was entered between
			<lb />
			each of these societies and respondent no.5 as also a power of attorney
			<lb />
			was issued by the societies in favour of respondent no.5 and
			<lb />
			respondent no.6-Architect. It is not in dispute that on 27 August 2008,
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 through respondent no.6-Architect submitted a
			<lb />
			proposal with the SRA to implement a composite scheme under DCR
			<lb />
			33(10) for these three societies on the land bearing C.S.No.1500 (pt)
			<lb />
			admeasuring about 7876 square meters. Also on 27 August 2008 an
			<lb />
			acceptance report was prepared by the Superintendent of the
			<lb />
			Engineering Department, SRA, on a proposal submitted by respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 and development planning remarks came to be made, that the
			<lb />
			land is situated in the residential zone and falls under CRZ and is not
			<lb />
			reserved for any public purpose. It was also noted that for an Annexure
			<lb />
			II, the applicant (respondent No.5) has submitted a list of tenants/slum
			<lb />
			dwellers, required under Annexure II and a consent/resolution from
			<lb />
			the society of the slum dwellers that more than 70% have given their
			<lb />
			consent, was also recorded. Further, it is also not in dispute that a
			<lb />
			General Body Resolution was passed by the petitioner and respondent
			<lb />
			nos.8 and 9 -societies to include certain other slum dwellers who had
			<lb />
			become members of these societies and who were occupying the
			<lb />
			adjacent land namely C.S.no.2166 (pt) and 2124 (pt) admeasuring
			<lb />
			13478.32 sq.meters in the said scheme and in pursuance thereto an
			<lb />
			acceptance report was prepared by the Executive Engineer, SRA dated
			<lb />
			14 December 2009. That a revised proposal dated 27 August 2008 was
			<lb />
			submitted by respondent no.5 through its architect-respondent no.6 for
			<lb />
			amalgamation of area of C.S.No.2116 (pt) and 2124 (pt) in the slum
			<lb />
			scheme. Thus a revised proposal came to be submitted increasing the
			<lb />
			members of the slum dwellers, who came to be added in the scheme
			<lb />
			and who would also become eligible for permanent alternate
			<lb />
			accommodation, if found eligible as per the eligibility norms. On 8
			<lb />
			June 2010 the Deputy Collector/Competent Authority, issued a report
			<lb />
			and certified Annexure II for total 802 eligible slum dwellers out of
			<lb />
			1362 slum dwellers. The report states that respondent no.5 almost has
			<lb />
			consent of 658 eligible slum dwellers which is more than about 70%
			<lb />
			and in fact stated to be 82%.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			153.
			<lb />
			It is also not in dispute that the land was affected by CRZ
			<lb />
			notification, since it was within 500 meters from the high tide line. It
			<lb />
			was affected by the reservation for the DP road of 60.8 meters having
			<lb />
			an area of 13338.83 sq. meters which would reduce the plot area to
			<lb />
			7126.89 sq.meters, also out of this, 30% of the plot was to be affected
			<lb />
			by the proposed Metro-III project. Hence, actual plot area for
			<lb />
			rehabilitation was 4988 sq.meter which was 25% of the total area.
			<lb />
			There were also reservations such as education complex, for St. Xavier
			<lb />
			Institute. On 14 July 2010 the certified Annexure II dated 8 June 2010
			<lb />
			was forwarded by the certifying authority to SRA.
			<lb />
			Also in July, 2012 in regard to Mahim Bay within which the land
			<lb />
			in question would fall, and in regard to the exemption of the land from
			<lb />
			CRZ Notification, a writ petition filed by one Deepak Rao (Writ Petition
			<lb />
			no.1263 of 2012) was pending before this Court. The claim in the writ
			<lb />
			petition was made in pursuance of the 2011 CRZ notification, as to
			<lb />
			whether it would change the development requirements qua the land
			<lb />
			falling within the Bay of Mahim, which was earlier restricted to 500
			<lb />
			meters from the High Tide Line. The contention of the petitioner
			<lb />
			therein was that the rules for development would be required to be
			<lb />
			considered now by applying the norms of 100 meters from high tide
			<lb />
			line and not 500 meters. This was to have a direct bearing on the
			<lb />
			development potential in respect of the land in question. This Court
			<lb />
			disposed of the writ petition with a direction to Maharashtra Coastal
			<lb />
			Zone Management Authority (MCZMA), to grant hearing to Deepak
			<lb />
			Rao and pass an appropriate orders on his representation. The
			<lb />
			Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority, in turn referred the
			<lb />
			matter to Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and
			<lb />
			National Coastal Zone Management Authority for clarification. On 4
			<lb />
			December 2012, also an application was made by respondent no.5 to
			<lb />
			the Principal Secretary, Urban Development Department for reduction
			<lb />
			of width of the proposed DP road to 30.3 meters in view of reduction in
			<lb />
			traffic in pursuance to construction of Bandra-Worli Sea Link road.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			154.
			<lb />
			On 6 February 2013 Annexures were forwarded by the
			<lb />
			Deputy Collector, SRA to the Engineering Department. Also a second
			<lb />
			writ petition was filed by Mr.Deepak Rao on 25 November 2013 (Writ
			<lb />
			Petition No.327 of 2013) which came to be disposed of with a direction
			<lb />
			to MCZMA to take decision on the representation of Deepak Rao and to
			<lb />
			interpret the word &apos;Bay&apos; as per 2013 CRZ notification and other
			<lb />
			relevant notifications. Pursuant to the High Court&apos;s direction the
			<lb />
			MCZMA in its meeting dated 31 January 2014, for the first time
			<lb />
			declared that the land beyond 100 meters of high tide line of Mahim
			<lb />
			Bay and Creek would not fall within the restrictive ambit of the CRZ
			<lb />
			notification. On 6 June 2014, as per the assurance given to the societies
			<lb />
			on 10 April 2014 respondent no.5 applied to the CEO SRA for a LOI for
			<lb />
			the slum scheme. On 4 February 2016 SRA certified Annexure III in
			<lb />
			favour of respondent no.5. On 5 February 2016 the SRA issued a letter
			<lb />
			of intent in favour of respondent no.5 which was interalia incorporates
			<lb />
			Condition 31 that LOI will have no bearing on any parallel proceedings
			<lb />
			under any section of the Slums Act. On 12 April 2015, respondent no.5
			<lb />
			applied to SRA for intimation of approval (IOA) for implementation of
			<lb />
			scheme to enable respondent no.5 to commence construction. On 28
			<lb />
			June 2016 the SRA authorities submitted IOA report for issuance of
			<lb />
			revised LOI to respondent no.5 for approval of CEO SRA. On 8 march
			<lb />
			2017, the SRA issued a revised LOI to respondent no.5. On 22 February
			<lb />
			2018 the SRA issued commencement certificate of rehabilitation
			<lb />
			building no.1.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			155.
			<lb />
			Having noted the admitted facts, relevant to the proposal
			<lb />
			on the file of the SRA, it needs to be stated that in regard to an
			<lb />
			endeavour of the petitioner to have a general body meeting and to pass
			<lb />
			a resolution to remove respondent No.5 as the developer and thereafter
			<lb />
			approach the CEO, SRA, there are whole lot of facts which included not
			<lb />
			only resolutions being passed, but proceedings adopted by the slum
			<lb />
			dwellers before various authorities ultimately culminating into filing of
			<lb />
			writ petitions before this Court and adjudication of these writ petitions
			<lb />
			as noted in detail above. All these facts would necessarily call for
			<lb />
			discussion in dealing with the questions falling for determination which
			<lb />
			are addressed below :-

			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Q.I Whether the findings and conclusion of the CEO-
			<lb />
			SRA and the AGRC, that the requirement of consent of 70% slum
			<lb />
			dwellers agreeing for redevelopment of slums in question, stood
			<lb />
			complied, qua the slum redevelopment proposal, submitted by
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 on behalf of the petitioner and respondent nos.8 and
			<lb />
			9, can be said to be perverse and illegal ?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			On a bare reading of the statutory scheme under the DCR
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			33(10) it is quite clear that the requirement for a slum scheme is that
			<lb />
			70% of the slum dwellers come together and apply to the SRA for
			<lb />
			redevelopment of the slum after formation of a proposed co-operative
			<lb />
			housing society. Such an application is usually made by the proposed
			<lb />
			society after appointment of a developer which would be considered by
			<lb />
			the SRA. The position in law in regard to the requirement of 70 % of
			<lb />
			the slum dwellers coming together at the &quot;threshold&quot; and so as to make
			<lb />
			a valid application is no more res-integra. Some decisions in this
			<lb />
			regard can be referred.
			<lb />
			In Awdesh Vasistha Tiwari &amp; Ors. Vs. Chief Executive
			<lb />
			Officer, Slum Rehabilitation Authority, 63 , a Division Bench of this Court
			<lb />
			in regard to the requirement of 70 % of the slum dwellers coming
			<lb />
			together and forming a co-operative society observed thus :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			20.
			<lb />
			If the entire scheme under Regulation 33(10) is perused it is
			<lb />
			obvious that if 70% of the slum dwellers on a particular area come
			<lb />
			together and apply after formation of proposed co-operative housing
			<lb />
			society, the said application has to be independently considered in
			<lb />
			accordance with law.
			<lb />
			The scheme does not contemplate
			<lb />
			simultaneous consideration of such an application made by a
			<lb />
			proposed society with an Application subsequently made by another
			<lb />
			proposed society relating to same land. The Applicant-society has to
			<lb />
			have 70% support which obviously two societies cannot have. The
			<lb />
			Application received first is to be processed first independtly. If it
			<lb />
			fails to get 70% support, Second Application can be examined. The
			<lb />
			obvious intention is to avoid unhealthy competition between the
			<lb />
			different builders who are interested in supporting such societies. If
			<lb />
			63 2006(4) Mh.L.J.
			<lb />
			such a course of simultaneous consideration is permitted to be
			<lb />
			adopted, unscrupulous persons and builders will try to win over the
			<lb />
			hutment dwellers who have supported the application made earlier
			<lb />
			by another society. Therefore, it is not desirable that an application
			<lb />
			which is earlier made and the one which is subsequently filed
			<lb />
			should be considered together. That is not the scheme provided
			<lb />
			under D.C. Regulation 33(10). It is necessary that the application
			<lb />
			which is first received in respect of a particular property by the SRA
			<lb />
			should be processed and decided first. After decision of the first
			<lb />
			Application, the second Application made by another society can be
			<lb />
			considered depending on the result of the first Application. The
			<lb />
			reason is that none of the societies have any right, title and interest
			<lb />
			in respect of the property. Such a course will prevent the unhealthy
			<lb />
			competition between the builders or between the leaders of two
			<lb />
			groups in a slum area.

			<lb />
			Developers Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Ors. 64 the Division Bench of this Court in regard
			<lb />
			to the requirement of 70% of the slum dwellers observed thus :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			At the stage when an application is submitted before the Slum
			<lb />
			Rehabilitation Authority, the application, as it stands , must
			<lb />
			indicate that the applicant fulfills the requirement of the
			<lb />
			requisite consent of 70% of the slum dwellers. The claim of the
			<lb />
			applicant is thereupon subject to scrutiny. But before the
			<lb />
			question of scrutiny arises, the application must on its face
			<lb />
			indicate that it fulfills the requirement of 70% consents.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			158.
			<lb />
			It is clear that the requirement of 70% of the slum dwellers
			<lb />
			coming together is at the stage when an application is submitted
			<lb />
			before the Slum Rehabilitation Authority, and when such an application
			<lb />
			is made it should fulfill the requirement of requisite consent of
			<lb />
			70% of the slum dwellers. In a recent judgment of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			64 2011(3) Mh.L.J. 604
			<lb />
			in Susme Builders Private Limited Vs. Chief Executive Officer, Slum
			<lb />
			Rehabilitation Authority &amp; Ors. (supra), the Supreme Court has
			<lb />
			recognised the requirement of 70% of the slum dwellers coming
			<lb />
			together to make an application.
			<lb />
			Following are the relevant
			<lb />
			observations :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			Whether support of 70% of the slum dwellers is mandatory and
			<lb />
			whether slum dwellers are entitled to withdraw their consent;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			58.
			<lb />
			It would be important to note that under 1991 DCR,
			<lb />
			which were initially applicable to this project, a scheme for
			<lb />
			rehabilitation could be initiated where more than 70% of the
			<lb />
			eligible hutment dwellers on the land agreed to the
			<lb />
			redevelopment scheme by becoming members of a cooperative
			<lb />
			society. Thereafter, the scheme was to be considered by the
			<lb />
			authorities for implementation. Relevant portion of the DCR
			<lb />
			reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;Initiation of the scheme, -Where more than 70% of the
			<lb />
			eligible hutment dwellers on the land agree to join the
			<lb />
			redevelopment scheme and become members of the cooperative
			<lb />
			society, the scheme should be considered for implementation.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			59.
			<lb />
			Under Development Control Regulation 33(10) of
			<lb />
			1991 DCR, the essential requirement was that at least 70% of
			<lb />
			the slum-dwellers had to form a society with a view to
			<lb />
			redevelop the slum area. In case 70% slum-dwellers did not
			<lb />
			join, there could be no rehabilitation scheme. As far as the
			<lb />
			present case is concerned it is not disputed that more than 70%
			<lb />
			slum-dwellers had formed Respondent 3 Society. It is the
			<lb />
			admitted case of the parties that 800 out of 867 slum-dwellers
			<lb />
			formed Respondent 3 Society, which is 92.27%.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			60.
			<lb />
			The 1991 DCR were amended in 1997. Clause 1.15
			<lb />
			of Appendix IV of the amended DCR provided that 70% or more
			<lb />
			of eligible hutment dwellers in a slum must agree to join a
			<lb />
			rehabilitation scheme before it can be considered for approval.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			61.
			<lb />
			It is thus obvious that under the amended DCR, not
			<lb />
			only 70% or more of the eligible hutment dwellers must first
			<lb />
			agree to join a rehabilitation scheme before it is taken up for
			<lb />
			consideration, but the owner/developer or cooperative society
			<lb />
			must also enter into individual agreements with each of these
			<lb />
			eligible hutment dwellers. We may also point out that the
			<lb />
			amended DCR in clause 1.16 of Appendix IV provides that even
			<lb />
			in respect of those eligible hutment dwellers who do not join
			<lb />
			the project willingly, the developer/builder has to make
			<lb />
			provision for accommodation of these hutment dwellers in the
			<lb />
			scheme. They are entitled to the same benefits as the hutment
			<lb />
			dwellers who actually join the scheme. They are also entitled to
			<lb />
			similar transit accommodation as is allotted to those who
			<lb />
			willingly join the scheme. Further, the regulations also provided
			<lb />
			that if such hutment dwellers do not join the scheme and do not
			<lb />
			accept the transit accommodation or the completed premises,
			<lb />
			then they can be removed from their hutments and it will be
			<lb />
			ensured that these hutment dwellers do not cause any
			<lb />
			hindrance to the project.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			62.
			<lb />
			Very lengthy arguments were addressed by learned
			<lb />
			counsel on the issue whether 70% support of the slum dwellers
			<lb />
			is mandatory. A large number of authorities have also been
			<lb />
			cited but, in our view, it is not necessary to refer to the various
			<lb />
			authorities because the bare provisions of law are sufficient to
			<lb />
			decide this issue. A bare reading of DCR of 1991 makes it
			<lb />
			absolutely clear that under the said DCR at least 70% of the
			<lb />
			slum dwellers/occupiers have to get together and form a
			<lb />
			Society for the purpose of slum re-development scheme.
			<lb />
			Therefore, unless 70% slum dwellers agree to form a Society,
			<lb />
			the provisions of the Slums Act could not be invoked to frame
			<lb />
			an SRD scheme. Under the amended DCR of 1997, there is a
			<lb />
			change and the change is that now the developer/owner was
			<lb />
			required to enter into agreements with 70% of the slum
			<lb />
			dwellers and unless 70% of the slum dwellers agree, the slum
			<lb />
			rehabilitation scheme cannot be entertained. The magic figure
			<lb />
			remains at 70%. The idea behind it is that more than 2/3 of the
			<lb />
			occupiers must agree for the rehabilitation scheme.

			<lb />
			Also in Vasant Kheraj Bhanushali &amp; Ors. vs. Goregaon
			<lb />
			Siddharth Nagar Sahakari Grih Nirman Sanstha Ltd. &amp; Ors. 65 , the
			<lb />
			Division Bench of this Court in regard to the requirement of 70% has
			<lb />
			observed thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;11. As regards the allegation that there was an assignment by
			<lb />
			the new developer in breach of the provisions of the tripartite
			<lb />
			agreement, it has been stated before the Court that on 4
			<lb />
			January 2010 an agreement for project management was
			<lb />
			entered into by the developer with HDIL. That agreement has
			<lb />
			since been cancelled on 26 July 2010. In that view of the
			<lb />
			matter, the submission would cease to have any practical
			<lb />
			65 2011 (3) Mh. L.J. 433
			<lb />
			relevance. Finally, it has been urged that the scheme does not
			<lb />
			have the support of 70% of the occupants. In this regard, it is
			<lb />
			common ground before the Court that the High Powered
			<lb />
			Committee had called upon MHADA to carry out a physical
			<lb />
			verification of the consents of the existing tenants. There is a
			<lb />
			finding of fact that 70% of the occupants have consented to the
			<lb />
			scheme. In a project such as the one which is involved in the
			<lb />
			present case, there is always a shifting body of occupants,
			<lb />
			consisting of persons who are willing to shift loyalties to rival
			<lb />
			builders against a promise of better incentives. Consents once
			<lb />
			given cannot be allowed to be revoked at the whim and fancy
			<lb />
			of individual occupants. If that was to be allowed, no scheme
			<lb />
			for redevelopment could be successfully implemented. Though
			<lb />
			none of the Petitioners had furnished their consents, what is
			<lb />
			material is that there is a determination of fact that 70% of the
			<lb />
			existing occupants have consented to the scheme.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			160.
			<lb />
			Having noted the position in law, to consider as to whether
			<lb />
			in the facts of the present case, the requirement of consent of 70% slum
			<lb />
			dwellers was fulfilled, in respondent no.5 submitting the slum
			<lb />
			redevelopment proposal, some factual background is required to be
			<lb />
			noted. Respondent No.5 was unanimously appointed by the petitioner
			<lb />
			and respondent No.8 and respondent No.9-societies by general body
			<lb />
			resolution passed in June 2006. Thereafter on 17 October 2006
			<lb />
			independent development agreements were entered between the
			<lb />
			petitioner and respondent No.5 as also between respondent Nos.8 &amp; 9
			<lb />
			and respondent No.5 and subsequent to which a composite proposal for
			<lb />
			redevelopment of the slums was filed by respondent No.5 on 27 August
			<lb />
			2008 and further on 23 August 2009. These three societies also passed
			<lb />
			general body resolutions to include the adjacent lands CTS No.2116
			<lb />
			(PT), 2124(PT), admeasuring 13478.32 sq. mtrs.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			161.
			<lb />
			This indicates that there was no dispute till this point of
			<lb />
			time on anything much less any dispute on 70 % of the slum dwellers
			<lb />
			coming together not only appointing respondent no 5 but also
			<lb />
			submitting slum rehabilitation scheme through respondent no.5. It can
			<lb />
			thus be said that the basic requirement of 70% of the slum dwellers
			<lb />
			consenting, stood satisfied in submitting the slum redevelopment
			<lb />
			proposal. Nonetheless after this many things happened and how far
			<lb />
			they would be relevant to the proposal already submitted can be seen
			<lb />
			from the following discussion.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			162.
			<lb />
			It appears that there was some activity in the petitioner&apos;s
			<lb />
			camp leading to a disquiet and in pursuance of which respondent No.5
			<lb />
			furnished an undertaking to the petitioner dated 10 April 2014 that a
			<lb />
			L.O.I. would be obtained by respondent No.5 by 30 June 2014,
			<lb />
			however the same could not be obtained. At the same time, there
			<lb />
			appeared to be also some activity of discomfort against respondent
			<lb />
			No.5 amongst a group of slum dwellers belonging to respondent Nos.8
			<lb />
			and 9. However despite respondent No.5 assuring that LOI would be
			<lb />
			obtained before 30 June 2014, on 30 May 2014 the Managing
			<lb />
			Committee of the petitioner held a meeting and decided to terminate
			<lb />
			the services of respondent No.6-Architect. Thereafter on 15 June 2014,
			<lb />
			a general body meeting of the petitioner was convened and a resolution
			<lb />
			was passed to terminate appointment of respondent No.5 as a
			<lb />
			developer and appointing respondent No.7-M/s.SLK Buildcon Private
			<lb />
			Limited, as a new developer for implementing the slum scheme.
			<lb />
			Accordingly the petitioner addressed a letter to the CEO, SRA, on 27
			<lb />
			June 2014 requesting to remove the name of respondent No.5 from the
			<lb />
			record of SRA and substitute the name of respondent No.7 as a new
			<lb />
			developer. A copy of the said letter was also forwarded to the Assistant
			<lb />
			Registrar, Co-operative Societies, SRA with a request to call for a special
			<lb />
			general body meeting as required by circular No.80 issued by the SRA,
			<lb />
			to ascertain as to which of the developers would have consent of more
			<lb />
			than 70% of the eligible slum dwellers and depute a representative
			<lb />
			nominated from the office of the SRA to participate in the special
			<lb />
			general body meeting of the petitioner.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			163.
			<lb />
			In pursuance to the above letter of the petitioner, the
			<lb />
			Assistant Registrar by his letter dated 15 July 2014 addressed to the
			<lb />
			petitioner informed that the petitioner&apos;s request to hold general body
			<lb />
			meeting was approved. The petitioner was directed to call a general
			<lb />
			body meeting of all the eligible slum dwellers with an agenda for
			<lb />
			appointment of Managing Committee Members and other committee
			<lb />
			members and verify whether respondent No.5 continued to enjoy
			<lb />
			consent of 70% eligible slum dwellers and if not take a decision
			<lb />
			regarding consent for appointment of respondent No.7 as a new
			<lb />
			developer. This action initiated by the letter dated 15 July 2014 of the
			<lb />
			Assistant Registrar (SRA) did not find favour with some of the slum
			<lb />
			dwellers who approached the Divisional Joint Registrar Co-operative
			<lb />
			Society, challenging the said letter dated 15 July 2014 issued by the
			<lb />
			Assistant Registrar by filing a revision application on 18 July 2014. On
			<lb />
			1 August 2014 an interim order was passed by the Divisional Joint
			<lb />
			Registrar inter-alia granting a stay to the operation of the said letter
			<lb />
			dated 15 July 2014. Ultimately on 11 September 2014 the Divisional
			<lb />
			Joint Registrar allowed this revision application filed by the slum
			<lb />
			dwellers, whereby he quashed and set aside the letter dated 15 July
			<lb />
			2014 issued by the Assistant Registrar permitting the petitioner to
			<lb />
			convene a general body meeting. This decision of the Divisional Joint
			<lb />
			Registrar was challenged by some of the slum dwellers before this
			<lb />
			Court in Writ Petition No.8410 of 2014, Writ Petition No.8414 of 2014
			<lb />
			and Writ Petition No.8412 of 2014 which came to be decided by a
			<lb />
			judgment and order dated 18 December 2014 rendered by the learned
			<lb />
			Single Judge. The learned Single Judge set aside the said orders passed
			<lb />
			by the Divisional Joint Registrar inter-alia observing that the Divisional
			<lb />
			Joint Registrar had no jurisdiction qua the procedure adopted by the
			<lb />
			CEO, SRA as the Assistant Registrar, SRA had acted on the instructions
			<lb />
			of the CEO, SRA. The District Joint Registrar hence could not have gone
			<lb />
			into the validity of the action being initiated by the Assistant Registrar.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			164.
			<lb />
			On a reading of the said order passed by this Court, it
			<lb />
			appears that the petitions were filed by the meeting conveners/
			<lb />
			organizers of respondent No.9 Hind Ekta CHS. As seen from paragraph
			<lb />
			5[A] of the order, it was the case of these meeting conveners, that by a
			<lb />
			resolution passed by the general body meeting on 27 June 2014
			<lb />
			appointment of respondent No.5 was terminated and respondent No.7
			<lb />
			M/s.SLK Buildcon Private Limited was appointed as a new developer.
			<lb />
			It is in this context, observations are made by the Court in paragraph 9
			<lb />
			referring to the case of the petitioner, that initially in the year 2006
			<lb />
			respondent No.5 was appointed by the proposed society and the
			<lb />
			agreement has been terminated in the year 2014 and new developer
			<lb />
			respondent No.7 M/s.SLK Buildcon was appointed to redevelop the
			<lb />
			property. However what is pertinent is to note the observations of the
			<lb />
			Court on the disputes regarding appointment and termination of the
			<lb />
			developer. The Court observed as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The record indicates that the proposed society has
			<lb />
			not been registered and there are rival claims by the
			<lb />
			members of the society regarding the appointment
			<lb />
			and termination of the developers.
			<lb />
			Several
			<lb />
			applications/ complaints from the members of the
			<lb />
			proposed society were received by the SRA in this
			<lb />
			regard. The CEO, SRA in the light of the disputes
			<lb />
			regarding the appointment and termination of the
			<lb />
			developers to redevelop the property and in view of
			<lb />
			circular Nos.72 and 80 came to the conclusion that
			<lb />
			fresh general body meeting of the proposed society
			<lb />
			be held in the presence of the representatives of the
			<lb />
			SRA in order to ascertain which of the developers
			<lb />
			has consent of more than 70% eligible slum dwellers
			<lb />
			and accordingly, by his order dated 11 July 2014
			<lb />
			directed the Assistant Registrar -SRA to hold
			<lb />
			general body meeting of the proposed society.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			165.
			<lb />
			In pursuance of the orders passed by this Court, the
			<lb />
			Assistant Registrar issued a letter dated 13 January 2015 to the
			<lb />
			petitioner and respondent Nos.8 and 9 calling upon the petitioner to
			<lb />
			call for a general body meeting as per circular No.80. By a further
			<lb />
			letter dated 23 January 2015 the Assistant Registrar informed the
			<lb />
			petitioner that a meeting convened on 31 January 2015 by the
			<lb />
			petitioner be cancelled, as complaints were received in regard to the
			<lb />
			said meeting which was to be held on the Nokarda ground, Fishermen
			<lb />
			Colony, near Raheja Hospital, Sion-Mahim Link Road, which was a
			<lb />
			open ground and the general body meeting could create a law and
			<lb />
			order situation. Thereafter on 23 January 2015 public notices were
			<lb />
			issued by the authorized officers informing that the general body
			<lb />
			meeting of the eligible slum dwellers of the petitioner would be held on
			<lb />
			8 February 2015 at 11.00 a.m. with an agenda to appoint Chief
			<lb />
			Promoter and other committee members, open bank account and
			<lb />
			whether respondent No.5 had consent to act as a developer. On 28
			<lb />
			January 2015 respondent No.5 and slum dwellers filed application
			<lb />
			Nos.3 of 2015 and 4 of 2015 before the High Power Committee
			<lb />
			challenging the notice for holding a general body meeting on 8
			<lb />
			February 2015 as also challenging the order dated 14 July 2014 of the
			<lb />
			CEO, SRA making an endorsement on draft LOI report prepared by
			<lb />
			Engineering Department for meeting of the society is to be held. A
			<lb />
			relief was also prayed by respondent No.5 that respondent No.2 be
			<lb />
			directed to issue LOI in favour of respondent No.5. By an order dated
			<lb />
			30 January 2015 passed by the High Power Committee, a status-quo
			<lb />
			order was granted and eventually meeting convened on 8 February
			<lb />
			2015 could not be held. On 5 March 2015, application No.3 of 2015
			<lb />
			and application No.4 of 2015 were allowed by the High Power
			<lb />
			Committee and the order dated 14 July 2014 passed by the Chief
			<lb />
			Executive Officer, SRA was set aside. This order passed by the High
			<lb />
			Power Committee was challenged by respondent No.9 in Writ Petition
			<lb />
			(L.) No.673 of 2015 and Writ Petition (L.) No.674 of 2015. A Division
			<lb />
			Bench of this Court by its judgment and order dated 21 September
			<lb />
			2015 dismissed the said writ petitions directing that the SRA shall take
			<lb />
			a decision uninfluenced by conclusions in the impugned order dated 5
			<lb />
			March 2015 passed by the High Power Committee and including the
			<lb />
			orders of this Court. Certain observations made by the Division Bench
			<lb />
			interalia considering circular No.80 would have relevance and are
			<lb />
			required to be noted:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;24. For properly appreciating the rival contentions we must refer to
			<lb />
			the two Circulars and which are relied upon by both the Petitioners
			<lb />
			and the SRA. The first Circular is to be found at page 234 of WP
			<lb />
			No.674 of 2015. That Circular is dated 15th February, 2008 and bears
			<lb />
			No.80. The subject of this Circular issued by the SRA would show that
			<lb />
			it deals with the presence of the representative of the SRA at a
			<lb />
			meeting and where the slum dwellers of the proposed Society or any
			<lb />
			Association would elect or select Chief Promoter and Developer. The
			<lb />
			Circular observes that when slum rehabilitation schemes are proposed
			<lb />
			and proposals from the proposed societies of slum dwellers are
			<lb />
			received and thereafter permissions are sought to reserve the name
			<lb />
			and allot a code number,so as to open a bank account with such
			<lb />
			request and proposals, the minutes of the meeting convened to elect
			<lb />
			the Chief Promoter, the Developer, an Architect and authorization
			<lb />
			letter in their favour, power of attorney and development agreement
			<lb />
			are relied upon. However, whenever there are further steps taken on
			<lb />
			the basis of these documents and relying upon them, it is experienced
			<lb />
			that several disputes arise and inter alia regarding the election of the
			<lb />
			Chief Promoter, the Developer etc. There are complaints received from
			<lb />
			the affected parties by the SRA in this regard . All this goes to show
			<lb />
			that the progress and implementation of the slum rehabilitation
			<lb />
			scheme is affected and puts a question mark on its future. Therefore, it
			<lb />
			is directed that once the Annexure II is prepared, then a meeting
			<lb />
			which will be convened to elect a Chief Promoter, the Developer and
			<lb />
			the consent of the Developer, it would be mandatory that at such
			<lb />
			meeting convened representatives of the SRA are present, further
			<lb />
			video recording of the proceedings of the meeting has to be carried
			<lb />
			out. This Circular enlists the subjects or the agenda items for the
			<lb />
			meeting, the notice period and other ancillary issues and directions
			<lb />
			with regard thereto. The notice has to be issued to those who should
			<lb />
			remain present and participate in accordance with this Circular. These
			<lb />
			directions be issued to all concerned so that they abide by.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			25. Circular No.148 has been issued on 2nd February 2015 and that
			<lb />
			refers and relies upon the prior Circular No.80 and thereafter states
			<lb />
			that the proceedings of the meeting and which would be convened to
			<lb />
			discuss the above agenda items should be transparent. An impartial
			<lb />
			Presiding Officer must conduct the meeting. That is why the SRA
			<lb />
			further directs that the meeting must be convened strictly in
			<lb />
			accordance with prior Circular. This Circular goes ahead and directs
			<lb />
			the Department of Cooperation, Government of Maharashtra to ensure
			<lb />
			that it must depute an official so as to preside over the Meeting. Thus,
			<lb />
			the meeting be convened and proceedings thereat now to be held
			<lb />
			under the control and supervision of the statutory Authority.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			26. These Circulars are issued by the SRA in order to ensure that
			<lb />
			the Cooperative Housing Societies (Proposed) of the slum dwellers
			<lb />
			elect a Chief Promoter, a Developer and thereafter preparatory steps
			<lb />
			taken should not then be questioned by filing complaints and
			<lb />
			applications etc. That would delay the implementation of the slum
			<lb />
			rehabilitation scheme. That is why all such meetings and to elect the
			<lb />
			Chief Promoter and Developer etc. have to be held in terms of these
			<lb />
			directions contained in two Circulars.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			29. Precisely, for the reasons and which take care of a situation like
			<lb />
			the present one that this Court directed in the said judgment that if
			<lb />
			one proposal or one scheme is under consideration of the SRA, then it
			<lb />
			must take that scheme to its logical end, it must convey either
			<lb />
			issuance of LOI or refusal. When that scheme is under consideration of
			<lb />
			the SRA, no other scheme should be considered by the SRA parallely
			<lb />
			and consideration of more than one scheme at the same time leads to
			<lb />
			confusion and chaos and may lead to avoidable disputes and
			<lb />
			complaints. There could be claims and assertions and which would go
			<lb />
			contrary to the object and purpose sought to be achieved by the Slums
			<lb />
			Act. If the slum rehabilitation schemes can be framed and
			<lb />
			implemented and equally planning laws have been amended so as to
			<lb />
			ensure that people residing in unhygienic and inhabitable conditions
			<lb />
			obtain a decent accommodation, then such schemes have to be
			<lb />
			expeditiously framed and implemented. It is part and parcel of
			<lb />
			prudent urban planning to avoid proliferation of slums in mega cities
			<lb />
			like Mumbai. The general impact on sanitation and hygiene in a city
			<lb />
			like Mumbai and caused by slums is tremendous. We have witnessed
			<lb />
			several scenes of garbage and waste thrown around particularly in
			<lb />
			slums. Slum or slum like structures which are constructed and spring
			<lb />
			up on public properties and lands are a risk to the health and safety of
			<lb />
			the residents of the city as a whole. That is a reflection on planning.
			<lb />
			That is why SRA as a single Authority has been given several powers
			<lb />
			including that of the Planning Authority and of registration of
			<lb />
			Societies under the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act. A single
			<lb />
			window system is carved out and SRA must therefore take a decision
			<lb />
			and monitor and supervise implementation of the slum rehabilitation
			<lb />
			scheme. This is a scheme with public and private participation. If an
			<lb />
			opportunity is given to the slum dwellers to choose a developer after
			<lb />
			forming a Society and submit a proposal to the SRA for its sanction,
			<lb />
			then a single proposal being taken to the logical end serves the object
			<lb />
			of the Act better. In the present case, we do not see why the SRA did
			<lb />
			not take a decision on the application made by Respondent No.8
			<lb />
			expeditiously. It could have independently satisfied itself about the
			<lb />
			financial power of the Respondent No.8 to implement the slum
			<lb />
			rehabilitation scheme and construct buildings by developing the
			<lb />
			property. If Respondent No.8 did not have the requisite support or the
			<lb />
			financial strength to take the scheme ahead, then nothing prevented
			<lb />
			the SRA from taking an appropriate decision including rejecting the
			<lb />
			Application seeking the LOI. However, the SRA allowed the decision to
			<lb />
			be postponed and indefinitely. It allowed the Petitioners thereafter to
			<lb />
			set up a rival claim. It also allowed itself to be converted into a full
			<lb />
			fledged dispute redressal forum and to decide issues arising out of the
			<lb />
			Slums Act as also Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act 1960. That is
			<lb />
			why the HPC reminded the SRA of its duties in law. We do not see the
			<lb />
			direction of the nature given by the HPC to be contravening any
			<lb />
			provision of law.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			30. We have perused that order of the HPC and we find that what
			<lb />
			the impugned order really holds is that the SRA had before it a full
			<lb />
			fledged application of Respondent No.8. The HPC considered the rival
			<lb />
			contentions and thereafter found that it is undisputed that when the
			<lb />
			scheme was submitted by the Developer -Respondent No.8, he
			<lb />
			claimed support of 82 % of the eligible slum dwellers out of total 804.
			<lb />
			There is a complaint that no progress was made at site and that is why
			<lb />
			a group of people supported and formed another Society with another
			<lb />
			developer who was interested in developing /implementing subject
			<lb />
			slum rehabilitation scheme, that is what the intervention of the
			<lb />
			Petitioners is termed by the HPC. The HPC then did not go into the
			<lb />
			issue whether the alleged resolution of termination of the authority of
			<lb />
			Respondent No.8 as Developer has been passed by the proposed
			<lb />
			Society in the presence of Assistant Registrar of SRA. It has also found
			<lb />
			that there is procedure laid down for change of developer under the
			<lb />
			slum rehabilitation scheme. Moreover, the Chief Executive Officer
			<lb />
			could have taken action under section 13(2) of the Slums Act.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			31. We do not intend to express any opinion, much less, final on the
			<lb />
			contention and which was canvassed before the HPC and possibly
			<lb />
			found favour with it. All that we wish to emphasize is that if an
			<lb />
			application is made by Respondent No.8 and it claims to enjoy support
			<lb />
			of 82 % of the eligible slum dwellers, then, it was incumbent upon
			<lb />
			SRA to take that application to its logical end and conclusion. This is
			<lb />
			the expectation of the HPC from the SRA, more so, when the SRA
			<lb />
			could have taken note of any complaint with regard to the alleged
			<lb />
			inaction of Respondent No.8. It is empowered to do sounder section
			<lb />
			13 of the Slums Act. Hence eventual direction of the HPC to SRA
			<lb />
			cannot be faulted or interfered with.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			34. We accordingly hold that the SRA will take a decision
			<lb />
			uninfluenced by any observations and conclusions in the impugned
			<lb />
			order and including an order of this Court.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			35. We therefore proceed to dismiss this Petition and having
			<lb />
			clarified as above, we do not find that the HPC&apos;s order can be termed
			<lb />
			as vitiated, by errors apparent on the face of the record or perverse
			<lb />
			nor the HPC has exceeded its power and jurisdiction.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			166.
			<lb />
			The observations of the Division Bench in paragraphs 29,
			<lb />
			30 and 31 are significant, recording that respondent No.5 in submitting
			<lb />
			the proposal to the SRA had a support of 82% of the eligible slum
			<lb />
			dwellers. The Division Bench also made serious observations in the
			<lb />
			SRA delaying to take a decision on the proposal/scheme of respondent
			<lb />
			No.5. The consequence of the above writ petitions being dismissed,
			<lb />
			was that the High Court upheld the orders dated 5 March 2015 passed
			<lb />
			by the High Power Committee on application Nos.3 of 2015 and 4 of
			<lb />
			2015, whereby, the High Power Committee set aside the order dated 14
			<lb />
			July 2014 passed by the CEO-SRA, as also the action initiated by the
			<lb />
			Assistant Registrar to hold a general body meeting on 8 February 2015.
			<lb />
			It is on this backdrop the CEO-SRA was directed to take an
			<lb />
			independent decision without being influenced by the orders of the
			<lb />
			High Power Committee. Thus the situation which emerged was that
			<lb />
			the general body meeting which was to be held on 8 February 2015 to
			<lb />
			purportedly decide the purported fate of respondent No.5 did not take
			<lb />
			place and there was no termination of respondent No.5 as would be
			<lb />
			required to be undertaken even assuming that circular No.80 as issued
			<lb />
			by the SRA was to be applied. This factual position is compounded by
			<lb />
			a letter dated 10 October 2015 of the petitioner being an application to
			<lb />
			respondent No.2 made under Section 13(2) of the Slums Act inter-alia
			<lb />
			praying for a relief, to terminate respondent No.5 as a developer; to
			<lb />
			reject the application dated 6 June 2014 of respondent No.5 for
			<lb />
			issuance of an LOI; for a direction to the Assistant Registrar to conduct
			<lb />
			a fresh general body meeting of the society, to ascertain as to whether
			<lb />
			respondent No.5 had continuous support of 70% of eligible slum
			<lb />
			dwellers for implementation of the slum rehabilitation scheme on the
			<lb />
			subject land and for a direction that the Additional Collector/Deputy
			<lb />
			Collector (Encroachment and Removal) and the Competent Authority
			<lb />
			to re-verify Annexure-II dated 8 June 2010 and submit a report.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			167.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, on 17 December 2015 the CEO-SRA passed an
			<lb />
			order directing the Assistant Registrar to hold fresh elections of the
			<lb />
			three societies and if the newly elected &quot;managing committees&quot; submit
			<lb />
			application to the SRA, then a decision would be taken on such
			<lb />
			application as per rules. Consequently, the Assistant Registrar Mr. K.S.
			<lb />
			More, came to be nominated as an authorized officer to conduct
			<lb />
			elections of the society on 1 February 2016. This time the meeting as
			<lb />
			called by the Assistant Registrar came to be stayed by an order dated
			<lb />
			28 January 2016 passed by the Hon&apos;ble the Chief Minister.
			<lb />
			In the meantime following the procedure and probably
			<lb />
			also the observations of the Division Bench (supra), the SRA granted a
			<lb />
			LOI in favour of respondent No.5 on 5 February 2016.
			<lb />
			On 12 February 2016 the stay granted by the Hon&apos;ble Chief
			<lb />
			Minister was vacated which was in pursuance of a report dated 29
			<lb />
			January 2016 of the CEO to the Principal Secretary, that there are two
			<lb />
			factions in the society and it was not possible to ascertain whether
			<lb />
			respondent No.5 is enjoying majority support. The consequence is that
			<lb />
			the notice dated 16 January 2016 issued by the Assistant Registrar and
			<lb />
			nominating Mr.K.S. More, as an authorized officer to conduct the
			<lb />
			elections stood revived. Accordingly, on 17 March 2016, 19 March 2016
			<lb />
			and 20 March 2016 elections of the three societies were held. On 26
			<lb />
			March 2016 the newly elected committee members of the petitioner
			<lb />
			called for a meeting and resolved that the earlier decision to remove
			<lb />
			respondent No.5 as a developer be re-confirmed. However no such
			<lb />
			resolution was passed by the managing committees of respondent no. 8
			<lb />
			and 9.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			168.
			<lb />
			Consequent thereto on 28 March 2016 only the petitioner
			<lb />
			addressed a letter to the CEO, SRA informing that the newly elected
			<lb />
			Chief Promoter has terminated appointment of respondent No.5 and
			<lb />
			respondent No.6 and that the CEO should not accept, process or give
			<lb />
			any form of sanction to respondent No.5 and respondent No.6.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			169.
			<lb />
			Thereafter on 1 April 2016 it was only the petitioner who
			<lb />
			filed an application before the High Power Committee (application
			<lb />
			No.13 of 2016) praying for quashing of the LOI dated 5 February 2016
			<lb />
			issued by the SRA to respondent No.5. Also on 15 April 2016 the
			<lb />
			petitioner filed an application under Section 13(2) of the Slums Act
			<lb />
			before the CEO, SRA inter-alia praying to terminate/remove
			<lb />
			appointment of respondent No.5 as developer of the petitioner&apos;s society
			<lb />
			complaining of inordinate delay of 10 years in implementation of slum
			<lb />
			rehabilitation scheme on the subject property, and prayed that the CEO
			<lb />
			direct the Engineering Department of SRA to carve out the plot of the
			<lb />
			petitioner society being CTS. No.2116 (part), 2124(part) of Mahim
			<lb />
			Division from the LOI dated 5 February 2016.
			<lb />
			It is pertinent that the CEO, SRA had categorically
			<lb />
			observed in his order dated 17 December 2015 that the decision of the
			<lb />
			newly elected &quot;Managing Committees&quot; of the societies would be
			<lb />
			relevant. However admittedly there was only one managing committee
			<lb />
			of the petitioner seeking removal of respondent No.5. It cannot be
			<lb />
			overlooked that the proposal submitted by respondent No.5 with the
			<lb />
			consensus of more than 70% of the slum dwellers was a consolidated
			<lb />
			proposal of all the three societies and the lands in this regard.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			170.
			<lb />
			The question is, whether on the above backdrop, can it be
			<lb />
			said, that consensus of 70% of the slum dwellers was lacking, qua the
			<lb />
			appointment of respondent No.5 as the developer and the slum scheme
			<lb />
			as submitted by respondent no.5, so that it can be held that respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 ought to have been removed by the SRA and that too exercising
			<lb />
			powers under Section 13(2) of the Slums Act. In my opinion, certainly
			<lb />
			the answer would be in the negative. This for two fold reasons. Firstly
			<lb />
			for the reason that the petitioner is not disputing the fact that the
			<lb />
			petitioner&apos;s society is part of a composite slum rehabilitation scheme
			<lb />
			along with two other societies, namely respondent Nos.8 and 9, and
			<lb />
			that the proposal which was submitted by respondent No.5 for
			<lb />
			redevelopment was a composite proposal in respect of lands, inhabited
			<lb />
			by slum dwellers/ members of these three societies, the lands being
			<lb />
			amalgamated. It is not in dispute that respondent Nos.8 and 9 are not
			<lb />
			supporting the petitioner to change the developer and it is for this
			<lb />
			reason the petitioner chose to stand alone to take all necessary actions
			<lb />
			to remove respondent Nos.5 and 6, overlooking the fact that what is
			<lb />
			relevant under DCR 33(10) read with the procedure for submission of
			<lb />
			processing and approval of slum rehabilitation scheme is that consent
			<lb />
			of 70% or more of the eligible slum dwellers is necessary for
			<lb />
			maintaining an approval for an application for redevelopment of a
			<lb />
			slum. Clause 2 of the said procedure categorically provides that 70%
			<lb />
			or more of the eligible slum dwellers in a viable stretch at one place
			<lb />
			have to show their willingness to join a rehabilitation scheme and come
			<lb />
			together to form a co-operative housing society of all eligible slum
			<lb />
			dwellers through a resolution to that effect. However once the slum
			<lb />
			scheme was submitted, the society if it intended to change the
			<lb />
			developer then it can be done only on the grounds as specified under
			<lb />
			section 13(2) of the Slums Act for the reasons the SRA may find proper,
			<lb />
			applying the norms and the provisions of law, which would permit
			<lb />
			change of the developer. It is nobody&apos;s case that when respondent No.5
			<lb />
			submitted the initial and the modified proposal, respondent No.5 had a
			<lb />
			consent of more than 70% of the slum dwellers of these three societies,
			<lb />
			in fact it was 82%.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			171.
			<lb />
			It certainly cannot be at the ipse dixit of either the
			<lb />
			managing committee or the general body that a developer can be
			<lb />
			changed at any stage of the Scheme. Surely valid reasons are necessary
			<lb />
			to change the developer, as there are serious civil consequences to
			<lb />
			remove a developer in the midst of the procedure as put into motion.
			<lb />
			In this context even in Susme Builders Pvt.Ltd. (supra), the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court approving the decisions of this Court has sounded a word of
			<lb />
			caution, as observed in paragraph 86 of the report, which reads thus:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;86. Our attention was drawn to various judgments of
			<lb />
			the Bombay High Court that consent once given by the
			<lb />
			slum dwellers should not be permitted to be withdrawn. It
			<lb />
			was also brought to our notice that the Bombay High
			<lb />
			Court has consistently held that voting inter se developers
			<lb />
			should not be done. It has been the consistent view of the
			<lb />
			Bombay High Court that in case voting is done, then this
			<lb />
			will lead to developers trying to buy out the slum dwellers
			<lb />
			and then no rehabilitation scheme would attain fruition.
			<lb />
			We totally agree with the aforesaid views of the Bombay
			<lb />
			High Court. We must remember that slum dwellers
			<lb />
			normally belong to the poorest section of the society. They
			<lb />
			can be tempted to change their mind. In the present case
			<lb />
			itself, the slum dwellers shifted from Susme to J.G.
			<lb />
			Developers for two reasons -(i) Susme had delayed the
			<lb />
			project and (ii) J.G. Developers made a promise that it
			<lb />
			would give a flat of 344 sq. ft./419 sq. ft. area, which
			<lb />
			promise was obviously a false promise. The view of the
			<lb />
			Bombay High Court that consent once given should not be
			<lb />
			permitted to be withdrawn, is absolutely the right view.
			<lb />
			Otherwise, a person may give consent one day, withdraw
			<lb />
			it the second day and review the consent the third day,
			<lb />
			leaving the Scheme in a perpetual state of flux. For the
			<lb />
			aforesaid reasons, we agree with the Bombay High Court
			<lb />
			that there should be no inter se bidding between the
			<lb />
			builders. The proper course is that the scheme of the
			<lb />
			developer who is the first choice, should be placed before
			<lb />
			the slum dwellers and if it gets 70% votes, then the
			<lb />
			Scheme can be considered, but if it does not get 70%
			<lb />
			consent, then obviously, the second developer can be
			<lb />
			considered. However, competitive bidding should not be
			<lb />
			done because that can lead to a very unholy practice of
			<lb />
			developers trying to buy out the slum dwellers, which is
			<lb />
			also not in the interest of the rehabilitation scheme.

			<lb />
			Thus the SRA has to exercise due caution and only after
			<lb />
			considering the facts and circumstances of the case, justifying the
			<lb />
			removal of the developer, such an order can be passed as would be
			<lb />
			permissible in law. In the present case, it is quite clear that the
			<lb />
			petitioner intends to now disassociate itself from respondent Nos.8 and
			<lb />
			9 when already there is a amalgamated proposal/slum rehabilitation
			<lb />
			scheme which was subject matter of consideration with the CEO-SRA.
			<lb />
			For this purpose 70% would be required to be considered qua the
			<lb />
			proposal as submitted by respondent no.5, namely of all the three
			<lb />
			societies, though initially these were independent general body
			<lb />
			resolutions of society to appoint respondent No.5. Admittedly, the
			<lb />
			members of respondent Nos.8 and 9 who are 404 in number are not
			<lb />
			with the petitioner. In any case it is only the managing committee
			<lb />
			resolution of the petitioner which is being pressed into service by the
			<lb />
			petitioner to contend that it has 70% majority to remove respondent
			<lb />
			Nos.5 and 6. It needs to be emphasized that when respondent No.5
			<lb />
			was initially appointed it was a collective decision of the three societies
			<lb />
			as taken in their general body resolutions, in pursuance of which
			<lb />
			respondent No.5 acted and changed its position. Considering all these
			<lb />
			facts in my opinion, the petitioner&apos;s contention that 70% of the slum
			<lb />
			dwellers have lost confidence in respondent No.5, cannot be accepted
			<lb />
			and such a contention as one of the grounds to remove respondent
			<lb />
			Nos.5 and 6 is required to be rejected.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			173.
			<lb />
			The above observations are supported by the decision of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court in Balasaheb Arjun Torbole &amp; Ors. Vs. The
			<lb />
			Administrator &amp; Divisional Commissioner &amp; Ors. 66 . In this case, a
			<lb />
			similar contention as raised in the present petition fell for consideration
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court as seen from paragraph 2 of the decision which
			<lb />
			reads thus:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;In other words, the major grievance of the appellants
			<lb />
			is that the respondents have wrongly treated that
			<lb />
			there exists a consent for redevelopment from 70% of
			<lb />
			the occupants. Such claim, according to appellants,
			<lb />
			must be rejected and the appellants should be allowed
			<lb />
			to have the redevelopment through a cooperative of
			<lb />
			occupants of private plots exclusively. The other
			<lb />
			contention of the appellants is that their does not exist
			<lb />
			any valid Annexure II with respect to the private
			<lb />
			plots.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			In rejecting the said contention, in paragraphs 21, 22, 23 the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court observed thus:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;21. When in aggregate consent of 70% or more
			<lb />
			slum dwellers has been obtained, the essential purpose
			<lb />
			of slum rehabilitation scheme cannot be put to peril on
			<lb />
			the ground that certain procedures were not strictly
			<lb />
			followed or some steps were against the procedures
			<lb />
			prescribed in the guidelines for preparation of
			<lb />
			Annexure II in a prescribed format. From the
			<lb />
			documents submitted and shown at the stage of
			<lb />
			hearing it has been noticed that even subsequent
			<lb />
			claims of some slum dwellers that they are eligible for
			<lb />
			rehabilitation have been verified and many have been
			<lb />
			allowed on the basis of relevant documents because it
			<lb />
			is not infrequent that at the time of one particular
			<lb />
			checking or verification some dwellers may be absent
			<lb />
			and might have gone to some other place. Clearly the
			<lb />
			process of preparation of the list described as
			<lb />
			Annexure II and its verification is meant to find out the
			<lb />
			claims of genuine slum dwellers who may be eligible
			<lb />
			for benefits under the slum rehabilitation scheme.
			<lb />
			Such beneficial provisions meant to ameliorate the
			<lb />
			poor condition of slum dwellers, in our considered
			<lb />
			66 (2015) 6 SCC 534
			<lb />
			view, should not be jettisoned only on technical
			<lb />
			grounds or procedural infirmities unless the persons
			<lb />
			coming to the court and seeking relief through writ
			<lb />
			petition are able to show that they have suffered
			<lb />
			injustice or legal injury.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			22. In the present case, the only legal injury to
			<lb />
			appellants as per submissions of Mr. Parikh is that if
			<lb />
			the private plots were treated as separate slum area,
			<lb />
			the residents of these plots alone could have formed
			<lb />
			and carried out development scheme through their
			<lb />
			own cooperative society and gained some advantages
			<lb />
			including monetary. Such a plea is too far-fetched to
			<lb />
			establish legal injury to the appellants who claim to be
			<lb />
			slum dwellers and on such plea, in our considered
			<lb />
			view the appellants could not have been granted relief
			<lb />
			in writ jurisdiction which has been rightly denied to
			<lb />
			them, albeit for other reasons, after considering all
			<lb />
			their pleas on merits.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			23. The only other substantial issue raised by Mr.
			<lb />
			Parikh that there could have been no clubbing of
			<lb />
			private lands with municipal lands for purpose of
			<lb />
			counting consent of 70% of the slum dwellers is also
			<lb />
			found to be without any merits. Mr. Divan rightly
			<lb />
			relied upon DCR of 1991 and particularly clause 1.15
			<lb />
			of Appendix IV which clearly shows that 70% or more
			<lb />
			of the eligible hutment dwellers in a slum or pavement
			<lb />
			in a viable stretch at one place can agree to join a
			<lb />
			rehabilitation scheme. There is no merit in the
			<lb />
			submission on behalf of the appellants that the clause
			<lb />
			&quot;in a viable stretch at one place&quot; should be read only in
			<lb />
			conjunction with the word &apos;pavement&apos; and not the
			<lb />
			word &apos;slum&apos; although the use of the word &apos;or&apos; between
			<lb />
			slum and pavement clearly shows both have to be
			<lb />
			treated at same footing and therefore both are
			<lb />
			qualified by the clause &quot;in a viable stretch at one
			<lb />
			place&quot;. Clause 3.14 providing for amalgamation/sub-
			<lb />
			division of plots of Appendix IV of the DCR 1991 also
			<lb />
			goes a long way to support the submission that the
			<lb />
			statutory
			<lb />
			provisions
			<lb />
			clearly
			<lb />
			permit
			<lb />
			natural
			<lb />
			amalgamation/sub-division of plots for the sanction of
			<lb />
			slum rehabilitation project as well as for planning of
			<lb />
			Floor Space Index (FSI) thereto. Clause 7.7 and 7.8 in
			<lb />
			the same Appendix D lend further support to the
			<lb />
			aforesaid arguments of Mr. Divan.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Thus considering the statutory scheme, it can be very well said that
			<lb />
			once a developer is appointed, it is within the powers of the SRA on a
			<lb />
			proper verification and scrutiny of the facts and applying the rules and
			<lb />
			the law to take an appropriate decision on any proposal to change the
			<lb />
			developer and/or the viability of a new developer being appointed in
			<lb />
			the facts of a given case. This more particularly has to be seriously
			<lb />
			considered when the land belongs to a public body and/or the
			<lb />
			Government. A slum dweller would always have limited rights of
			<lb />
			rehabilitation in the manner as recognised under the statutory scheme
			<lb />
			and nothing more.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			174.
			<lb />
			It thus cannot be accepted more particularly considering
			<lb />
			the provisions of Section 13(2) of the Slums Act that a slum society at
			<lb />
			its sole discretion and /or without any control and regulations by SRA
			<lb />
			can change the developer. If such a course of action is made
			<lb />
			permissible, considering the hard realities and the hundreds of
			<lb />
			developers being available to take over such schemes, it would create a
			<lb />
			chaos and it is likely that a situation is created, that the slum
			<lb />
			rehabilitation scheme never takes off and it is entangled into fights
			<lb />
			between two factions within the society and/or two rival developers.
			<lb />
			This is certainly not the object of the legislation. It would be too far-
			<lb />
			fetched to read such draconian rights available to the Managing
			<lb />
			Committee or to general body of a society without any regulation,
			<lb />
			supervision and control of the SRA to change the developer. The SRA
			<lb />
			has all the powers not only to regulate and control such situations but
			<lb />
			to take a decision as to what is in the best interest of the slum dwellers
			<lb />
			and intended to achieve the object of the legislation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			175.
			<lb />
			Secondly it is not in dispute that the application of the
			<lb />
			petitioner for change of respondent no.5-developer was under Section
			<lb />
			13(2) of the Slums Act. Having noted this provision in the foregoing
			<lb />
			paragraphs, Section 13(2) of the Slums Act would come into play only
			<lb />
			when the developer fails to adhere to the provisions of the development
			<lb />
			permissions granted by the SRA and a change of developer can be
			<lb />
			sought only when there is an inordinate delay or the construction
			<lb />
			carried on, is contrary to the sanctioned plans and/or the permissions.
			<lb />
			Considering this clear position falling under Section 13(2), in the
			<lb />
			context of this factual controversy as raised by the petitioner in regard
			<lb />
			to the consent of 70% of the slum dwellers being not available to
			<lb />
			respondent no.5, I am of the clear opinion that the view taken by both
			<lb />
			the authorities, in not accepting the petitioner&apos;s contention, is required
			<lb />
			to be held to be correct and valid.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			176.
			<lb />
			Be that as it may, what is paramount for consideration in
			<lb />
			the facts of the present case is that, all this what has happened at the
			<lb />
			behest of slum dwellers who are occupying Government land and not
			<lb />
			any private property. In such a situation, under the provisions of the
			<lb />
			Act, once it is the Government land, surely the SRA is the custodian of
			<lb />
			the rights of the slum dwellers to be rehabilitated, by undertaking slum
			<lb />
			rehabilitation scheme. In this context, it would be apposite to note the
			<lb />
			observations of the Division Bench of this Court in Lokhandwala
			<lb />
			Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. State of Maharashtra and ors.
			<lb />
			(supra) when the Court taking note of the lands belonging to
			<lb />
			Government and Municipal Corporation which are declared as slum,
			<lb />
			observed thus:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;10. The execution of Slum Rehabilitation Schemes is
			<lb />
			impressed with a public character. The lands on which
			<lb />
			the Scheme is sought to be sanctioned and
			<lb />
			implemented may be lands belonging to the Municipal
			<lb />
			Corporation or to the State of Maharashtra or, for that
			<lb />
			matter, its instrumentalities such as the Maharashtra
			<lb />
			Housing and Area Development Authority. The title to
			<lb />
			the land does not vest in the society or in its members
			<lb />
			at the stage when the Scheme is propounded and
			<lb />
			subjected for sanction. Where it owns the land, the
			<lb />
			Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai is the
			<lb />
			authority responsible for issuing a certification of
			<lb />
			Annexure II containing the list of eligible occupants
			<lb />
			who can participate in the Scheme. The interest of the
			<lb />
			Municipal Corporation as the owner of the land is
			<lb />
			recognized by conferring upon the Municipal
			<lb />
			Corporation the role of verifying and authenticating
			<lb />
			who are the actual and genuine occupants of the land
			<lb />
			as on 1 January 1995. Public land is sought to be
			<lb />
			utilized in order to further the object of providing
			<lb />
			dignified accommodation to those living in slums. The
			<lb />
			co-operative societies of slum dwellers and developers
			<lb />
			through whom the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme is
			<lb />
			sought
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			be
			<lb />
			implemented
			<lb />
			facilitate
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			implementation of the Scheme. The agreements or
			<lb />
			arrangements that may be arrived at between them
			<lb />
			cannot be treated at par with purely private or
			<lb />
			contractual agreements entered into in respect of land
			<lb />
			belonging to private individuals. The State as the
			<lb />
			owner of the land upon which a slum is situated has a
			<lb />
			vital public interest in ensuring that the object for
			<lb />
			which the land is utilized subserves the purpose of
			<lb />
			rehabilitation of the slum dwellers. It is in that context
			<lb />
			that diverse provisions are made by the Development
			<lb />
			Control Regulations to regulate every stage of the
			<lb />
			Slum Rehabilitation Scheme, from the submission of
			<lb />
			the proposals, the evaluation of proposals, scrutiny
			<lb />
			and verification, grant of sanctions and the actual
			<lb />
			implementation of the Scheme. Though a dispute
			<lb />
			between the co-operative society and its developer has
			<lb />
			a private element, it is not as if that a recourse to
			<lb />
			private law remedies is the only available form of
			<lb />
			redress. The Slum Rehabilitation Authority as the
			<lb />
			authority which is vested with the power to regulate
			<lb />
			the implementation of the Scheme and the owners of
			<lb />
			the land such as the Municipal Corporation or, as the
			<lb />
			case may be, the State Government are vital
			<lb />
			components in the implementation of the Slum
			<lb />
			Rehabilitation Scheme. Their statutory powers to
			<lb />
			ensure that the Scheme is not misused and is utilized
			<lb />
			to subserve the public purpose underlying the Scheme
			<lb />
			is not trammeled by private contractual arrangements.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			15. Now undoubtedly, a developer who has been
			<lb />
			appointed by a co-operative society is required to
			<lb />
			fulfill the mandate of DCR 33(10) by securing the
			<lb />
			implementation of the scheme. Where a developer
			<lb />
			fails to implement the scheme, that would not
			<lb />
			preclude the society which represents the interests of
			<lb />
			hutment dwellers from proceeding to terminate the
			<lb />
			contract with the developer. The act of termination
			<lb />
			may, as in the present case, give rise to a private
			<lb />
			dispute to which a remedy may be available in
			<lb />
			accordance with the rights which the contractual
			<lb />
			arrangement creates between the parties. But, where
			<lb />
			the society seeks to appoint a new developer, it would
			<lb />
			be necessary that a proper verification and scrutiny is
			<lb />
			made of the authenticity of the proposal and of the
			<lb />
			grounds on which the society seeks to enter into a
			<lb />
			new contractual arrangement. Section 13(2) of the
			<lb />
			Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement, Clearance
			<lb />
			and Redevelopment) Act 1971 inter alia contemplates
			<lb />
			that where the Slum Rehabilitation Authority is
			<lb />
			satisfied that the land has not been developed within
			<lb />
			the time, if any, specified under such conditions as
			<lb />
			have been prescribed, the authority may determine to
			<lb />
			develop the land by entrusting it to any agency
			<lb />
			recognized by it for the purpose. It was urged on
			<lb />
			behalf of the co-operative society that Section 13(2)
			<lb />
			operates where a letter of intent is issued to the
			<lb />
			developer and would have no application where as in
			<lb />
			the present case a letter of intent was yet to be issued.
			<lb />
			We are not prepared to accept the submission which
			<lb />
			has been urged on behalf of the society that a
			<lb />
			proposed society of slum dwellers is entitled without
			<lb />
			any scrutiny or regulation of its activities by the
			<lb />
			statutory authorities to enter into and terminate
			<lb />
			development agreements at its own whim and fancy
			<lb />
			without any application of mind by the authorities
			<lb />
			concerned. To accept such a submission would only
			<lb />
			lead to a situation of chaos in the implementation of
			<lb />
			Slum Rehabilitation Schemes. Members of the
			<lb />
			managing committees of the societies which are still
			<lb />
			proposed societies would then be at liberty to pursue
			<lb />
			their own private ends and to switch loyalties between
			<lb />
			rival builders on considerations of exigency. Once the
			<lb />
			proposal has been submitted to the authority under
			<lb />
			DRC 33(10), the authorities are entitled to scrutinize
			<lb />
			whether a proposal involving the change of a
			<lb />
			developer is in the interest of the slum dwellers;
			<lb />
			whether the developer would fulfill the needs and
			<lb />
			requirements of the scheme and has the necessary
			<lb />
			capacity to do so and whether the new developer has
			<lb />
			the consents of 70% of the slum dwellers. There is
			<lb />
			absolutely no merit in the submission that while the
			<lb />
			initial proposal needs to have the consents of 70% of
			<lb />
			the slum dwellers, a proposal for a change or
			<lb />
			substitution of a developer need not possess the
			<lb />
			requisite majority. The acceptance of such a
			<lb />
			submission would only defeat the object and purpose
			<lb />
			of the provisions made in DCR 33(10) and Appendix
			<lb />
			IV and would result in rendering the schemes subject
			<lb />
			to misuse. Such an interpretation cannot be accepted.
			<lb />
			We are clearly of the view that the dispute between a
			<lb />
			society and the developer does not lie purely in the
			<lb />
			realm of a private contractual dispute. The dispute has
			<lb />
			an important bearing on the proper implementation of
			<lb />
			the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme. The dispute has
			<lb />
			consequences which go beyond the private interests of
			<lb />
			the society and the developer. The scheme involves
			<lb />
			other stake-holders in the process including the land
			<lb />
			owning public bodies and the slum dwellers whose
			<lb />
			interests are sought to be protected by the scheme.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			177.
			<lb />
			Thus having perused the findings as recorded by the
			<lb />
			authorities below in my opinion, no case is made out by the petitioner
			<lb />
			to hold that the respondent no 5 lacked the support of 70% of the slum
			<lb />
			dwellers so as to render the development proposal as submitted by
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 to be invalid.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			178.
			<lb />
			The Court also cannot shut its eyes to the fact that about
			<lb />
			644 hutments are already demolished out of which 205 structures are
			<lb />
			of the members of the petitioners who consented for demolition of their
			<lb />
			structures. Also interim rent is being received by those eligible slum
			<lb />
			dwellers who have vacated their premises and/ or whose hutments are
			<lb />
			demolished. All these facts clearly weaken the claim of the petitioner
			<lb />
			of having 70 % consent to remove respondent no. 5. If this was to be
			<lb />
			the case, 205 members of the petitioner together with the members of
			<lb />
			respondent no. 8 and 9 could never have accepted vacating of their
			<lb />
			hutments and demolition of their structures and they would have
			<lb />
			independently adopted proceedings against respondent no. 5. For
			<lb />
			these reasons, I find myself in complete agreement on what has been
			<lb />
			urged on behalf of the SRA, respondent no 5 and 6 and respondent no
			<lb />
			Whether transfer of shareholding in respondent
			<lb />
			No.5 by Shenghanis in favour of Porwals and by Porwals in favour of
			<lb />
			M/s.Omkar Realtors, would amount to induction of a new developer
			<lb />
			contrary to the statutory procedure to appoint a new developer; and/or
			<lb />
			whether it would amount to illegal sale of a slum scheme by one
			<lb />
			developer to another ?
			<lb />
			On this issue it is the petitioner&apos;s case that initially its
			<lb />
			members reposed confidence in one Mr. Mohanlal Shenghani and Mr.
			<lb />
			Chandulal Shenghani who held 100% of the shareholding in
			<lb />
			respondent No.5 and hence, they had appointed respondent No.5 as
			<lb />
			the developer (a company incorporated under the Companies Act,
			<lb />
			1956). The petitioner has contended that in the year 2012 share
			<lb />
			capital of respondent No.5 was increased, whereby 50,000 shares of
			<lb />
			respondent No.5 were allotted to Mr.Paras Porwal who effectively
			<lb />
			became 50% shareholder in respondent No.5 company, however, the
			<lb />
			petitioner was not informed of such change in the shareholding. The
			<lb />
			petitioner has stated that subsequently the entire shareholding of
			<lb />
			Shenghanis was transferred in favour of one Mr.Ronnie Porwal and
			<lb />
			respondent No.5 was completely controlled by the Porwal family. The
			<lb />
			petitioner contends that Porwals transferred their entire shareholding
			<lb />
			in favour of M/s. Omkar Realtors and a fresh allotment of 12450000
			<lb />
			shares valued at about Rs.12.45 Crores was made in favour of
			<lb />
			M/s.Omkar Realtors.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			180.
			<lb />
			The case of the petitioner is that this transfer of
			<lb />
			shareholding is illegal and primarily for two reasons. Firstly it amounts
			<lb />
			to inducting/appointing a new developer, not selected and appointed
			<lb />
			by the slum dwellers by this mechanism of transfer of shareholding. It
			<lb />
			is urged that this is contrary to the basic statutory framework under
			<lb />
			DCR 33(10) read with the procedure for submission of processing and
			<lb />
			approval of slum rehabilitation scheme. Secondly such transfer is in
			<lb />
			the teeth of the office order No.19 of 2015 dated 23 March 2015 issued
			<lb />
			by the SRA.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			181.
			<lb />
			Per contra, the SRA as also respondent No.5 have
			<lb />
			contended that there is nothing illegal in transfer of the shareholding in
			<lb />
			a company incorporated under the Companies Act, as also there is no
			<lb />
			prohibition for such transfer either under the Slums Act or D.C.R.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			33(10) and even under the office order dated 23 March 2015 issued by
			<lb />
			the SRA.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			182.
			<lb />
			To appreciate this issue, some basic requirements for
			<lb />
			appointing a developer would be required to be stated.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			183.
			<lb />
			Section 3A of the Slums Act empowers the SRA to take
			<lb />
			necessary action in order to achieve the object of rehabilitation of
			<lb />
			slums. As noted above Section 3D confers a power to do all such other

			<lb />
			The SRA exercising powers under the Slums Act has issued
			<lb />
			an Office Order No.SRA/CO/Office Order 19/2015, dated 23 rd March
			<lb />
			2015,
			<lb />
			providing
			<lb />
			for
			<lb />
			fees
			<lb />
			payable
			<lb />
			after
			<lb />
			change
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			Developer/Partner/Director
			<lb />
			while
			<lb />
			implementing
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			Slum
			<lb />
			Rehabilitation Scheme. The said order read thus :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;OFFICE ORDER
			<lb />
			Slum Rehabilitation Authority has frequently noticed the Instances
			<lb />
			wherein after the submission of Schemes by Developer / Partnership
			<lb />
			firm / Company / Joint Venture etc., changes are effected by these
			<lb />
			entities in the Shares / Stakes etc. of their respective Partners /
			<lb />
			Directors etc. at different stages of the Scheme. Sometimes, the
			<lb />
			Partnership Firm, Joint Venture or Company is totally replaced or
			<lb />
			taken over by new partners of Directors. Up-till now SRA has not
			<lb />
			formulated any procedure to recognize such change for effective and
			<lb />
			accountable Implementation of the S.R. Scheme. It is felt necessary
			<lb />
			that Slum Rehabilitation Authority should be made aware of such
			<lb />
			changes immediately so as to effectively supervise the redevelopment
			<lb />
			work. Henceforth, whenever there is any change in Partner / Director
			<lb />
			etc. or their Shares / Holdings etc. the following procedure should be
			<lb />
			followed :-
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			I.
			<lb />
			All changes have to be intimated to SRA within 30
			<lb />
			days of making formal change, failing which, a fine equal to 5
			<lb />
			times below shall be charged.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			II.
			<lb />
			In the event of change of Partner / Director in
			<lb />
			Partnership Firm / Company, Society / Trust or LLP of
			<lb />
			developer, their officials from the concerned Registration
			<lb />
			Authority/s, Registrar of Firms, Registrar of Companies (RoC),
			<lb />
			Registrar of Society, Charity Commissioner, etc. about having
			<lb />
			taken changes in the ownership on record shall be submitted
			<lb />
			on record of SRA within 90 days from the dated of such
			<lb />
			changes.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			III.
			<lb />
			In the event of change of developer, 5% of Land cost of
			<lb />
			sale plot area (i.e. approximately 50% of the net scheme area
			<lb />
			calculated as per ASR (Annual Schedule of Rates) payable
			<lb />
			thereon on
			<lb />
			should be recovered from the new Developer.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			IV.
			<lb />
			The charges mentioned in Clause (I) hereinabove, shall
			<lb />
			also be payable in the event of retirement of any Partner /
			<lb />
			Director proportionate to the share of incoming partner when
			<lb />
			the Developer is a partnership firm or a
			<lb />
			Private
			<lb />
			Limited
			<lb />
			Company / or LLP.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			V.
			<lb />
			The newly appointed Developer shall deposit
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			amount mentioned in clause (I) and (II)
			<lb />
			hereinabove
			<lb />
			as
			<lb />
			per Rules, Regulations of SRA
			<lb />
			before
			<lb />
			issuance
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			LOI/revised LOI or further approval by SRA.
			<lb />
			VI.
			<lb />
			These charges are applicable for changes in developer
			<lb />
			or in share holding patterns in developer company /
			<lb />
			organisation / partnership etc. after the stage of formal
			<lb />
			submission of the scheme.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			VII.
			<lb />
			The newly appointed developer shall indemnity
			<lb />
			SRA and its officers against any litigation in future.
			<lb />
			VIII. The Circular will not be applicable in cases where non-
			<lb />
			performing developer in terminated by the CEO/SRA at the
			<lb />
			request of society.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			IX.
			<lb />
			The charges mentioned in clause (I) and (II) shall not
			<lb />
			be payable if the changes are effected on account of death of
			<lb />
			Sole Developer or Partner or Director etc., towards legal heir
			<lb />
			(s) of the same.
			<lb />
			The guidelines prescribed hereinabove shall be followed by all
			<lb />
			the concerned henceforth scrupulously. &quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis added)
			<lb />
			On a reading of the aforesaid office order issued by the
			<lb />
			SRA as also from the statutory scheme, it is clear that the SRA
			<lb />
			acknowledges that sometimes &quot;Partnership Firms&quot;, &quot;Joint Venture&quot; or
			<lb />
			&quot;Company&quot; is replaced or taken over by new partners or directors. The
			<lb />
			office order also identifies in clauses (II to IV) the nature of changes
			<lb />
			that may take place in the Partnership Firm/Company undertaking the
			<lb />
			Slum Rehabilitation Scheme. It also requires the developer to intimate
			<lb />
			changes to SRA and make payment of fees for carrying out the same.
			<lb />
			This office order also prescribes for imposition of fine on account of
			<lb />
			failure to intimate the said changes within the prescribed time.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			188.
			<lb />
			Clause 4 of the Office Order provides for intimation and
			<lb />
			payment of fees on account of retirement of any partner/director
			<lb />
			proportionate to the share of the incoming partners when the developer
			<lb />
			is a partnership firm or a private limited company/LLP. Clause 4
			<lb />
			therefore permits change in the shareholding of the developer if it is a
			<lb />
			private limited company incorporated under the Companies Act, on
			<lb />
			payment of charges as per clause 1, and that such changes to be
			<lb />
			intimated to SRA within 30 days of making formal change failing which
			<lb />
			a fine equal to 5 times shall be charged.
			<lb />
			This office order as issued under the Slums Act, therefore
			<lb />
			does not prohibit any change in the shareholding of a company
			<lb />
			appointed as a developer. The petitioners have not challenged the
			<lb />
			legality of this office order. The sole purpose of the office order is to
			<lb />
			regulate the change in partnership/directorship/shareholding of the
			<lb />
			developer. In any case the legal and/or juristic identity of the
			<lb />
			developer as an artificial person, when it is a company incorporated
			<lb />
			under the companies Act, does not change on account of change in
			<lb />
			shareholding and even when the shareholding is of such a nature that it
			<lb />
			becomes a controlling shareholding in a company so appointed. It is
			<lb />
			well settled that a company which is an artificial person with a
			<lb />
			common seal and perpetual succession has a identity distinct from its
			<lb />
			shareholders and the transaction between the company and third
			<lb />
			parties are not transactions between the shareholders and third parties.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			189.
			<lb />
			In Bacha F. Guzdar vs. Commissioner of Income-tax
			<lb />
			(supra), the Supreme Court taking a review of law on this proposition,
			<lb />
			observed thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;7.
			<lb />
			.......The company is a juristic person and is distinct from the
			<lb />
			shareholders. It is the company which owns the property and not the
			<lb />
			shareholders. The dividend is a share of the profits declared by the
			<lb />
			company as liable to be distributed among the shareholders. (.....) This
			<lb />
			statement does not justify the contention that shareholders are owners of a
			<lb />
			divisible sum or that they are owners of the property of the company. (...)
			<lb />
			There is nothing in the Indian law to warrant the assumption that a
			<lb />
			shareholder who buys shares buys any interest in the property of the
			<lb />
			company which is a juristic person entirely distinct from the shareholders.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			9.
			<lb />
			It was argued that the position of shareholders in a company is
			<lb />
			analogous to that of partners inter se. -This analogy is wholly inaccurate.
			<lb />
			Partnership is -merely an association of persons for carrying on the business
			<lb />
			of partnership and in law the firm name is a compendious method of
			<lb />
			describing the partners. Such is, however, not the case of a company which
			<lb />
			stands as a separate juristic entity distinct from the shareholders. In
			<lb />
			Halsbury&apos;s Laws of England, Volume 6 (3rd Ed.), page 234, the law
			<lb />
			regarding the attributes of shares is thus stated :
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot; A share is a right to a specified amount of the share capital of a
			<lb />
			company carrying with it certain rights and liabilities while the
			<lb />
			company is a going concern and in its winding up. The shares or
			<lb />
			other interest of any member in a company are personal estate
			<lb />
			transferable in the manner provided by its articles, and are not of the,
			<lb />
			nature of real estate. &quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			10.
			<lb />
			In Borland&apos;s Trustee v. Steel Brothers &amp;,Co. Ltd.(1), Farwell J. held
			<lb />
			that &quot;a share in a company cannot properly be likened to a sum of money
			<lb />
			settled upon and subject to executory limitations to arise in the future ; it is
			<lb />
			rather to be regarded as the interest of the shareholder in the company,
			<lb />
			measured, for the purposes of liability and dividend, by a sum of
			<lb />
			money ........&quot; It was suggested that the dividend arises out of the profits
			<lb />
			accruing from land and is impressed with the same character as the profits
			<lb />
			and that it does not change its character merely because of the incident that
			<lb />
			it reaches the hands of the shareholder. This argument runs counter to. the
			<lb />
			definition of agricultural income which emphasizes the necessity of the
			<lb />
			recipient of income having a direct and an immediate rather than an indirect
			<lb />
			and remote relation with land. To accept this argument will be tantamount to
			<lb />
			saying that the creditor recovering interest on money debt due from the
			<lb />
			agriculturist who pays out of the produce of the land is equally entitled to the
			<lb />
			exemption. In fairness to Mr. Kolah it must, however, be stated that the
			<lb />
			contention was not so broadly put but there is no reason why one should stop
			<lb />
			at a particular stage and not pursue the analogy to its logical limits.&quot;
			<lb />

			190.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			The Madras High Court in Naga Brahma Trust vs.
			<lb />
			Translanka Air Travels P. Ltd. (supra) has held that a company possess a
			<lb />
			separate juristic character from its shareholders and as such, a change
			<lb />
			in shareholding of the lessee does not amount to transfer of the
			<lb />
			leasehold rights.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			191.
			<lb />
			This apart it would be too far-fetched to accept that the
			<lb />
			Slums Act which is a State Legislation creates an embargo for transfer
			<lb />
			of the shares in a company governed under the Companies Act as also
			<lb />
			permissible under the provisions of the said Act. (See Section 56, 58 &amp;
			<lb />
			Section 62 of the 2013 Act). The Slums Act and the Companies Act fall
			<lb />
			under different legislative powers of the respective legislatures as also
			<lb />
			both these legislations operate in different fields. I am thus of the clear
			<lb />
			opinion that there was no impediment whatsoever for Shengani to
			<lb />
			transfer the shareholdings in favour of Porwal and then from Porwal to
			<lb />
			M/s. Omkar Realtors.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			192.
			<lb />
			As a sequel to the above discussion, the contention as
			<lb />
			urged on behalf of the petitioner that corporate veil of respondent no. 5
			<lb />
			is required to be lifted to find out who is the actual developer
			<lb />
			undertaking the scheme, in my opinion, is not well founded. Even
			<lb />
			otherwise the SRA is on record to state in its affidavit dated 17 th
			<lb />
			September, 2018 that respondent no. 5 has submitted all relevant
			<lb />
			documents showing the change in shareholding for the purpose of
			<lb />
			reference (Annexure III to the SRA Scheme) and even as on date
			<lb />
			respondent no. 5 is continuing to be on record of SRA as a developer
			<lb />
			for implementation of slum scheme on the subject property and that
			<lb />
			transfer fees shall be recovered by SRA from respondent no. 5 as per
			<lb />
			the norms in respect of transfer of shares. SRA has also submitted that
			<lb />
			change in shareholding in the present case will not result in any
			<lb />
			revenue loss as contended by the petitioners and that office order has
			<lb />
			become applicable and recovery in that regard would be effected from
			<lb />
			respondent no. 5. Thus the contention of the petitioners of lifting of
			<lb />
			the corporate veil relying on the decision of Vodafone International
			<lb />
			Holdings BV (supra); CIT Vs. Sri Meenakshi Mills Ltd. (supra); and
			<lb />
			Delhi Development Authority Vs.Skipper Construction Co.(P) Ltd. &amp;
			<lb />
			Anr. (supra) is unfounded. Even otherwise these decisions hence are
			<lb />
			wholly inapplicable in the facts of the present case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			193.
			<lb />
			The contention as urged on behalf of the petitioner as also
			<lb />
			on behalf of SLK Buildcon, that change in the shareholding has in fact
			<lb />
			enabled a developer, who was not appointed by the slum dwellers, to
			<lb />
			gain a entry into the project in a manner which is alien to the Slums
			<lb />
			Act and which has resulted into commercial dealing of a slums scheme
			<lb />
			at the hands of the developers, also cannot be accepted. In my opinion,
			<lb />
			once the statutory scheme under the Slums Act and DCR 33(10)
			<lb />
			permits a company registered under the Companies Act to be appointed
			<lb />
			as a developer, this would necessarily include all necessary attributes
			<lb />
			which are associated with the juristic existence of such person, which
			<lb />
			would interalia include change in the shareholding as permissible
			<lb />
			under the Companies Act. A consequence emerging from such change
			<lb />
			of shareholding in a company would be required to be accepted as a
			<lb />
			change integral to such a company. Change in the shareholding in a
			<lb />
			company would not alter the legal character of the company and its
			<lb />
			obligation to perform its contractual obligations towards the Society,
			<lb />
			under a development agreement which would remain unaltered and at
			<lb />
			all material times enforceable against the company, appointed as a
			<lb />
			developer under the Slums Act or the D.C. Regulations, to undertake a
			<lb />
			Slum Scheme. It, therefore, cannot be conceived that mere change in
			<lb />
			the shareholding of a developer-company would tantamount to
			<lb />
			commercial dealing and/or transfer of a slums project at the hands of
			<lb />
			such developer against the wishes of the slum dwellers society. By
			<lb />
			appointing a company as a developer, the slum dweller society is
			<lb />
			deemed to have accepted its contractual association with a juristic
			<lb />
			entity and despite the change in the shareholding, the juristic entity of
			<lb />
			a developer so appointed, would always remain legal and valid.
			<lb />
			Moreover this argument as urged on behalf of the petitioner is in the
			<lb />
			teeth of the petitioner&apos;s own recognition of the juristic identity of
			<lb />
			respondent no. 5 in entering into a development agreement with
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 and not its promoters, and all legal consequences
			<lb />
			which are attributed and arising under such legal relationship with
			<lb />
			respondent no. 5, needs to be recognised, even for the purposes of the
			<lb />
			Slums Act. Even Clause 43 of the development agreement entered
			<lb />
			between the petitioner and respondent no.5 cannot be construed to
			<lb />
			mean that it would not permit a change in the shareholding of
			<lb />
			respondent no.5. Thus, there is no illegality whatsoever in the AGRC
			<lb />
			rejecting such contention as urged on behalf of the petitioner that
			<lb />
			transfer of the shareholding has amounted to an illegal dealing by
			<lb />
			respondent no. 5 of the slum scheme in question in favour of M/s.
			<lb />
			Omkar Realtors.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			194.
			<lb />
			There is another vital facet of which the petitioners are
			<lb />
			unmindful in objecting to a change of shareholding namely, that such a
			<lb />
			mechanism as available to a company (legal person) to alter its
			<lb />
			shareholding and to invite more capital in a given situation would
			<lb />
			come to the aid and benefit of the slum dwellers society. This in as
			<lb />
			much as it is likely, that such a corporate developer can make available
			<lb />
			more specialised resources, including financial which would ultimately
			<lb />
			benefit the slum scheme which may not be always possible for an
			<lb />
			individual developer or a partnership firm. In the present case, it is
			<lb />
			quite clear that the share capital of respondent no. 5 has gradually
			<lb />
			increased and M/s.Orbit Realtor is now holding substantial
			<lb />
			shareholding than what Shengani&apos;s were holding in respondent no. 5
			<lb />
			when the development agreement came to be entered by the petitioner
			<lb />
			with respondent no. 5 at which time Shengani was holding only 50000
			<lb />
			shares. All these beneficial effects of the company being appointed as a
			<lb />
			developer are relevant and stand impliedly recognised in the said Office
			<lb />
			Order isued by the SRA. Thus the contention as urged on behalf of the
			<lb />
			petitioner and SLK Buildcon relying on the decisions in Susme Builders
			<lb />
			Pvt.Ltd. Vs. CEO SRA &amp; Ors. (supra); Pramila Suman Singh Vs. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra (supra) and Awdesh Vasistha Tiwari Vs. Chief Executive
			<lb />
			Officer, Slum Rehabilitation Authority (supra), Atesham Ahmed Khan V.
			<lb />
			Lakadawala Developers Pvt. Ltd. (supra) and Lokhandwala Pvt. Ltd. Vs.
			<lb />
			State of Maharashtra (supra) to contend that there there is
			<lb />
			circumvention of the established procedure of appointment of
			<lb />
			developers under the Slums Act read with DCR 33(10) in view of the
			<lb />
			change in the shareholding, cannot be accepted. In any event, these
			<lb />
			are not the decisions which lay down any absolute proposition that
			<lb />
			shareholding in a company who has been appointed as developer
			<lb />
			cannot be transferred. Even in Susme (supra) in regard to the transfer
			<lb />
			of shareholding the Supreme Court in making observations in
			<lb />
			paragraph 80 of the decision does not reach to a conclusion that
			<lb />
			transfer of shareholdings is not permissible. What has been commented
			<lb />
			is in regard to the conduct of Susme, that despite the change in the
			<lb />
			shareholding, it treated the slum dwellers as a means of making money
			<lb />
			which was purely in the facts of the said case. Following are the
			<lb />
			observations of their Lordships:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			80.
			<lb />
			We may also add that though Susme may have
			<lb />
			remained the same entity in name, there have been, at
			<lb />
			least, three changes in the promoters of Susme and these
			<lb />
			transfers of shareholdings obviously must have been done
			<lb />
			for consideration. It is more than obvious that Susme, as a
			<lb />
			legal entity, was treating the slum dwellers only as a
			<lb />
			means of making money and, therefore, we are clearly of
			<lb />
			the view that Susme is not entitled to any relief.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			195.
			<lb />
			The next contention as urged on behalf of the petitioner
			<lb />
			relying on various decisions as noted above that what could not be
			<lb />
			directly done by Shenganis or Porwal, namely transfer of a slum
			<lb />
			scheme, has been achieved indirectly by transfer of shareholding also
			<lb />
			cannot be accepted. Once the legislation and the Statutory scheme
			<lb />
			itself permits such transfer in the shareholding, there is no question of
			<lb />
			petitioners contending that the slum scheme was being dealt, as a
			<lb />
			marketable or tradeable commodity interse between the shareholders.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			196.
			<lb />
			The petitioners have next contended that change in the
			<lb />
			developer ought to be only by following a procedure under the Rules
			<lb />
			and in no other manner. To support this contention, on behalf of the
			<lb />
			petitioner reliance is placed on the decision in Jamal Uddin Ahmad V.
			<lb />
			Abu Saleh Najmuddin (supra); Center for Public Interest Litigation Vs.
			<lb />
			Union of India &amp; Anr. (supra) which lay down that when the statute
			<lb />
			mandates that something is to be done in a particular way, the things
			<lb />
			cannot be done in any other way. As discussed above, this argument of
			<lb />
			the petititoners cannot be accepted. It would be untenable to accept
			<lb />
			that by transfer of shares, the statutory provisions of the Act stand
			<lb />
			evaded by such shift or contrivance applying the principle as laid down
			<lb />
			by Abbot,C.J. in Fox Vs. Bishop of Chester 67 . Consequently, in the facts
			<lb />
			of the present case, the decision in Shrisht Dhawan (Smt) (supra);
			<lb />
			Jagir Singh Vs. Ranbir Singh and the decision of Delhi High Court in
			<lb />
			The Associated Journal Ltd. &amp; Anr. Vs. Land and Development Office
			<lb />
			would have no application, as it cannot be said that there is any fraud
			<lb />
			on the statute, in the absence of any prohibition to transfer the
			<lb />
			shareholding in a developer company under the scheme of the Slums
			<lb />
			Act.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			197.
			<lb />
			It needs to be observed that the contention on the change
			<lb />
			in the shareholding was raised by the petitioners and SLK Buildcon
			<lb />
			before AGRC. It was not a ground on which the petitioner moved the
			<lb />
			CEO SRA to remove respondent no. 5 and on the basis of which the
			<lb />
			show cause notice dated 20 th April, 2017, was issued to respondent no.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			5. Respondent no. 5 would accordingly be right in its contention that
			<lb />
			the issue of change of shareholding though raised by the petitioner
			<lb />
			before AGRC in the additional affidavit and not even in the grounds in
			<lb />
			fact was not within the ambit of adjudication of the show cause notice
			<lb />
			which had taken place before CEO SRA. In my opinion, in any case,
			<lb />
			such an argument on the change in the shareholding being canvassed
			<lb />
			on behalf of respondent no. 7-SLK Buildcon, who came to be appointed
			<lb />
			as a new developer by the petitioners is totally untenable. Respondent
			<lb />
			no. 7-SLK Buildcon has no locus to urge such a contention and more
			<lb />
			particularly when SLK Buildcon is a company incorporated under the
			<lb />
			Companies Act.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			198.
			<lb />
			Respondent no. 5 would also be right in contending that
			<lb />
			the contentions of the petitioner on change of shareholding in fact
			<lb />
			militated against Clause 5 and 14 of the Development Agreement
			<lb />
			entered between the petitioner and respondent no. 5 wherein the
			<lb />
			petitioner has accepted to appoint respondent no. 5 as a developer. It
			<lb />
			certainly does not show that it was Shengani who was appointed as
			<lb />
			developer but it was respondent no. 5-Shee Nidhi Concept Relators Pvt.
			<lb />
			Ltd., who was appointed as a developer. In any event such a contention
			<lb />
			also cannot be held to be relevant to Section 13(2) of the Slums Act.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			199.
			<lb />
			As a sequel to the above discussion, the second question is
			<lb />
			required to be answered in the negative so as to hold that the transfer
			<lb />
			of shareholding in respondent no. 5 in favour of Omkar Realtors is legal
			<lb />
			and valid and would not amount to an illegal transfer of a slum
			<lb />
			scheme.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>

			<lb />
			Q.III Whether the concurrent findings of the CEO-SRA
			<lb />
			and the AGRC that there is no delay/willful delay on the part of
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 in implementing the slum scheme, can be said to be
			<lb />
			perverse and illegal, so as to warrant an approval under Section 13(2)
			<lb />
			of the Slums Act to change respondent no.5 as a developer ?
			<lb />
			To decide this question at the cost of some repetition, some
			<lb />
			background facts are required to be restated. As noted above it is not
			<lb />
			in dispute that not only the petitioner but respondent no.8 and 9, being
			<lb />
			the proposed societies of the slum dwellers unanimously appointed
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 as the developer in June 2006. A development
			<lb />
			agreement dated 17 October 2006 was entered by these societies with
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 to undertake a slum redevelopment scheme. A
			<lb />
			consequent power of attorney was also issued in favour of respondent
			<lb />
			no.5. Undoubtedly slums in question which are scattered on three
			<lb />
			plots are not small slums as noted above. Qua the petitioner, there were
			<lb />
			669 tenements and initially the total slum dwellers/hutments in respect
			<lb />
			of these three societies were 1263 hutments, who were required to be
			<lb />
			surveyed as per the procedure, to determine the eligibility of these slum
			<lb />
			dwellers, to be housed in a permanent alternate accommodation. For
			<lb />
			this a long procedure was required to be undertaken. It appears from
			<lb />
			the record that between the period October 2006 to August 2008,
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 took necessary steps to secure individual irrevocable
			<lb />
			consents from the members of these three societies. This included
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 entering into individual agreements with the slum
			<lb />
			dwellers which itself was a substantial task. After obtaining all the
			<lb />
			relevant documentary evidence, a draft Annexure II was required to be
			<lb />
			prepared which also required preparation of plans. The following form
			<lb />
			of Annexure II would indicate the intricate details which are required
			<lb />
			to prepare an Annexure II as prescribed under the Schedule to
			<lb />

			<lb />
			It is not in dispute that respondent no.5 thereafter on 27
			<lb />
			August 2008 submitted a proposal through its Architect -respondent
			<lb />
			no.6 to the SRA for implementing a &quot;single composite slum
			<lb />
			rehabilitation scheme&quot; under DCR 33(10), for rehabilitating the slum
			<lb />
			dwellers of the three societies, on a plot bearing C.S.no.1500 (pt)
			<lb />
			admeasuring 7876.26 sq.meters. Such a proposal is required to be
			<lb />
			submitted in &apos;Annexure I&apos; which interalia includes the developer setting
			<lb />
			out details of the exiting hutments; their eligibility; zone; reservation as
			<lb />
			per development plan alongwith survey remarks; lay out; sub division;
			<lb />
			amalgamation; area statement; deduction for set back area; proposed
			<lb />
			road; computation of tenement density; computation of free sale areas,
			<lb />
			built up areas for rehabilitation, exclusion for FSI computation, and
			<lb />
			amongst several other details the cost of the project under different
			<lb />
			heads. On submission of the first proposal, the Superintendent
			<lb />
			Engineering (SRA) and the AE (SRA) issued a report which was
			<lb />
			endorsed by the Executive Engineer. Clause 3 of the report regarding
			<lb />
			the development plan remarks, recorded that the land was affected by
			<lb />
			Coastal Zone Regulations. It was also recorded that consent of more
			<lb />
			than 70% of the slum dwellers has been obtained as stated in Clause 4.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			202.
			<lb />
			It is also not in dispute that slum dwellers who were
			<lb />
			occupying adjoining land admeasuring 11176 sq.meters also intended
			<lb />
			to join the slum scheme of the petitioner and respondent nos.8 and 9.
			<lb />
			The petitioner had no objection for this. However, this adjoining land
			<lb />
			lacked a City Survey number (C.S.Number). The architect of
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 was therefore, required to make an application to the
			<lb />
			Collector for allotment of C.S.Number for the said adjoining land. On
			<lb />
			17 October 2008 after undertaking an exercise of measuring the land,
			<lb />
			correspondence ensued between the Collector and the Additional Chief
			<lb />
			Secretary. Finally, on 28 July 2009, the Additional Chief Secretary
			<lb />
			(Revenue) granted approval to the Collector for allotment of
			<lb />
			C.S.number to the unnumbered plot to be shown in the State
			<lb />
			Government&apos;s name. Accordingly, C.S. no.2124 was granted to the
			<lb />
			adjoining land admeasuring 11176 sq.meters. C.S.no.2124 (pt) was
			<lb />
			situated between C.S.No.1500 (pt) and C.S.No.2116 (pt).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			203.
			<lb />
			On account of the numbering of the plots respondent no.5
			<lb />
			submitted a revised proposal for amalgamation of land bearing
			<lb />
			C.S.no.2116 (pt) and 2124 (pt) total admeasuring to 13478.32
			<lb />
			sq.meters in addition to the original proposal dated 27 August 2008.
			<lb />
			Consequently on 23 August 2009 separate general body meetings were
			<lb />
			held by respondent nos.8 and 9 reconfirming appointment of
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 as a developer. It was also resolved to include other
			<lb />
			slum dwellers of the adjoining lands to be part of the scheme. In
			<lb />
			pursuance to the fresh consent being accorded, on 4 December 2009
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 submitted a proposal for amalgamation of
			<lb />
			C.S.No.2116 (pt) and 2124 (pt) admeasuring 13478.32 sq.meters with
			<lb />
			the original scheme submitted in respect of C.S.no.1500(pt) which was
			<lb />
			admeasuring 7876.26 sq. meters.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			204.
			<lb />
			The record would indicate that surely none of the societies
			<lb />
			much less the petitioner had any grievance upto this stage which itself
			<lb />
			consumed about three and half years. Thus the contention of the
			<lb />
			petitioner that there was a delay since the year 2006 is ex-facie
			<lb />
			untenable.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			205.
			<lb />
			It needs to be stated that this new proposal was thereafter
			<lb />
			processed by the Assistant Engineer of the SRA and the Executive
			<lb />
			Engineer of the SRA. On 8 June 2010, the Deputy Collector
			<lb />
			(Encroachment &amp; Removal)/Competent Authority, issued an Annexure
			<lb />
			II Report&quot; certifying total 804 eligible slum dwellers out of 1263 slum
			<lb />
			dwellers. The report recorded that respondent no.5&apos;s appointment has
			<lb />
			the consent of 658 eligible slum dwellers which was about 82% as also
			<lb />
			noted in paragraph 12 of the order passed by the AGRC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			206.
			<lb />
			It is not in dispute that the petitioner and the other two
			<lb />
			societies (respondent nos.8 and 9) at all material times were aware
			<lb />
			that the land, subject matter of the proposal for slum redevelopment,
			<lb />
			was affected by Coastal Zone Regulation (CRZ) Notification issued by
			<lb />
			the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, as the
			<lb />
			land was within 500 meters from the High Tide Line. Also that there
			<lb />
			was a reservation of 60.80 meters wide D.P. Road of an area of
			<lb />
			13,338.83 sq.meters reducing the net plot area to 7126.89 sq.meters.
			<lb />
			There was also a proposed Metro Line-3 to pass through the land in
			<lb />
			question and about 30% of the plot area was affected by the Metro line.
			<lb />
			There was also a reservation for educational complex and St. Xavier
			<lb />
			Institute. It is accepting these reservations a proposal was submitted by
			<lb />
			respondent No.5 for redevelopment of the slums in question.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			207.
			<lb />
			All these issues of various reservations as noted above
			<lb />
			would become relevant if one considers the; &quot;Policy guidelines for the
			<lb />
			Development Plan for Greater Bombay for implementation of lands
			<lb />
			allocated to various users designated/reserved sites occupies by slums&quot;
			<lb />
			framed by the State Government in exercise of powers under Section
			<lb />
			31(1) of the MRTP Act. Under these guidelines there are different
			<lb />
			categories of lands classified as Category I to Category VIII. The policy
			<lb />
			specifies as to how the different categories of land are to be developed.
			<lb />
			It appears that the Annexure II was also being processed by SRA in
			<lb />
			consultation with the Collector.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			208.
			<lb />
			At this juncture it is required to be noted that the land in
			<lb />
			question being part of the Mahim Bay, and which was admittedly hit by
			<lb />
			the CRZ notification dated 19 February 1991 issued by the MOEF, was
			<lb />
			also a subject matter of an alteration qua the 500 meters High Tide
			<lb />
			line (HTL) restriction. This on account of issuance of another
			<lb />
			notification dated 6 January 2011 by the MOEF superseding the earlier
			<lb />
			CRZ notification dated 19 February 1991, in consequence of the MOEF
			<lb />
			approving a CZMP (Coastal Zone Management Plan) for Mumbai. By
			<lb />
			the said notification dated 6 January 2011 the Central Government
			<lb />
			declared the following areas as CRZ and imposed (from the date of the
			<lb />
			notification) certain restrictions on the setting up and expansion of
			<lb />
			industries, operation, process and the like in the CRZ.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			the land area from High Tide Line (hereinafter
			<lb />
			referred to as the HTL) to 500 mts on the landward side
			<lb />
			along the sea front.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			CRZ shall apply to the land area between HTL to
			<lb />
			100 mts or width of the creek whichever is less on the
			<lb />
			landward side along the tidal
			<lb />
			influenced
			<lb />
			water
			<lb />
			bodies that are connected to the sea and the distance
			<lb />
			up to which development along such tidal influenced
			<lb />
			water bodies is to
			<lb />
			be regulated shall be governed by
			<lb />
			the distance up to which the tidal effects
			<lb />
			are
			<lb />
			experience which shall be determined based on salinity
			<lb />
			concentration of 5 parts per thousand (ppt) measured
			<lb />
			during the driest
			<lb />
			period of the year and distance up
			<lb />
			to which tidal effects are
			<lb />
			experienced shall be clearly
			<lb />
			identified and demarcated accordingly in the Coastal
			<lb />
			Zone Management Plans.
			<lb />
			The expression tidal
			<lb />
			influenced
			<lb />
			water bodies was defined to mean the
			<lb />
			water bodies influenced by tidal
			<lb />
			effects from sea, in
			<lb />
			the bays, estuaries, rivers, creeks, backwaters,
			<lb />
			lagoons, ponds connected to the sea or creeks and like.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			209.
			<lb />
			The 2011 CRZ notification, hence, restricted the
			<lb />
			construction upto 500 meters from the HTL on the landward side of sea
			<lb />
			front. However, as far as &quot;Bay&quot; was concerned, restriction was reduced
			<lb />
			from 500 meters to 100 meters. This surely was one of the important
			<lb />
			factors which would weigh with the SRA, in considering the slum
			<lb />
			redevelopment proposal as submitted by respondent no.5, more
			<lb />
			particularly, the land being a government land. As noted it so
			<lb />
			happened that in or about July 2012 one Deepak Rao filed Writ Petition
			<lb />
			1623/2012 before this Court raising issues concerning the Mahim Bay.
			<lb />
			An order was passed by this Court on 1 November 2012 directing the
			<lb />
			Maharashtra Coastal Zone Authority to hear the said petitioner and
			<lb />
			pass appropriate orders on his representation. As no action was taken,
			<lb />
			Mr. Deepk Rao filed another petition (WP No. 327 of 2013) in this
			<lb />
			Court. On 25 November 2013 an order came to be passed on the said
			<lb />
			writ petition recording Mr. Rao&apos;s contention that 2011 CRZ notification
			<lb />
			having superseded the old 1991 notification, the land of Mr. Deepak
			<lb />
			Rao fell beyond 100 meters from the Mahim Bay. As the MCZMA
			<lb />
			despite a long wait was not getting any clarification from the National
			<lb />
			Coastal Zone Authority (NCZMA) the Court observed that the MCZMA
			<lb />
			cannot indefinitely wait and a decision either way is required to be
			<lb />
			taken. The order dated 25 November 2013 passed by this Court in the
			<lb />
			said writ petition was deliberated in the 86 th meeting of the MCZMA
			<lb />
			held on 27 November 2013 and thereafter in the 88 th meeting held on
			<lb />
			31 January 2014 the said authority observed as under :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			o
			<lb />
			The work of preparation of new CZMPs as per the
			<lb />
			provisions of the
			<lb />
			CRZ Notification, 2011 was under
			<lb />
			process by the State Government
			<lb />
			through
			<lb />
			MoEF
			<lb />
			authorized agencies. The appointed MoEF authorized
			<lb />
			agencies would take atleast one year to submit draft CZMPs
			<lb />
			to MCZMA.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			o
			<lb />
			The Hon&apos;ble High Court of Mumbai while passing the
			<lb />
			orders in WP No. 647 of 2012, WP No. 1694 of 2013 and WP
			<lb />
			No. 11595 of 2012 had observed that project proponet could
			<lb />
			not be expected to wait, merely because
			<lb />
			MCZMA
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			NCZMA were going to revise the CZMP in
			<lb />
			accordance
			<lb />
			with the CRZ notification 2011.
			<lb />
			o
			<lb />
			Further, National Hydrographic Office, Dehradun,
			<lb />
			which is one of the MoEF authorized agency vide letter dated
			<lb />
			28 th September 2013 had clarified that as per their records,
			<lb />
			Mahim bay was considered as &apos;Bay&apos; and was also depicted as
			<lb />
			&apos;Bay&apos; on official navigational chart.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			o
			<lb />
			The CRZ map prepared by IRS, Chennai, indicated
			<lb />
			that the project site
			<lb />
			is beyond 100 m from CRZ line from
			<lb />
			the HTL of Mahim bay and creek. The HTL line demarcated
			<lb />
			by the IRS was same as in the old CZMP approved by MoEF
			<lb />
			for the same location.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
			It was therefore held that the project site of Mr.Deepak Rao
			<lb />
			was situated outside CRZ area that is beyond 100 mts. line from HTL
			<lb />
			of Mahim Bay and creek as per the 2011 CRZ Notification.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			210.
			<lb />
			The above decision of the MCZMA taken on 31 January
			<lb />
			2014 was a significant development in respect of lands falling within
			<lb />
			the Mahim Bay as a new development potential was now available due
			<lb />
			to the alternation of the CRZ norms from 500 mts. HTL to 100 mts.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			HTL. The grievance of the petitioner is that respondent no.5, delayed
			<lb />
			the slums scheme awaiting the potential that would be available in
			<lb />
			view of this change in the CRZ Rules in as much as the petitioner was
			<lb />
			at all material times aware of the reservations and restrictions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			211.
			<lb />
			The above contention of the petitioner is unfounded. It
			<lb />
			cannot be conceived that respondent no.5 would be aware in 2006 that
			<lb />
			in 2011 a CRZ notification would be issued by the MOEF which would
			<lb />
			possibly alter development potential in respect of such lands. However,
			<lb />
			the moment such a potential become available it cannot go unnoticed
			<lb />
			and more particularly for those like respondent no.7-SLK Buildcon,
			<lb />
			would like to reap commercial gains which would be so available.
			<lb />
			Slums on the Government land and the Government having turned a
			<lb />
			blind eye to safeguard public interest on such lands, is an ideal
			<lb />
			situation for developers to look for business by undertaking a slum
			<lb />
			redevelopment scheme when there is likelihood of a large free sale
			<lb />
			area, which would be available and that too in a prime location.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			212.
			<lb />
			The above developments in regard to the CRZ were
			<lb />
			destined to cause difficulties with the SRA qua the petitioner&apos;s project.
			<lb />
			This for the reason that the petitioner who did not appear to have any
			<lb />
			complaint on the slums scheme being processed by the SRA authorities
			<lb />
			as submitted by respondent no.5, invited a letter from respondent no.5
			<lb />
			dated 10 April 2014 which was addressed by Mr.Senghani (then
			<lb />
			Director of respondent no.5) to the petitioner, that a Letter of Intent be
			<lb />
			obtained by respondent no.5 by 30 June 2014 and satisfactory progress
			<lb />
			be achieved to start the construction, failing which a no objection
			<lb />
			would be handed over to the society by respondent no.5.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			213.
			<lb />
			It also appears that respondent no.8, respondent no.9 and
			<lb />
			the petitioner held General Body Meetings on 3 May 2014, 4 May 2014
			<lb />
			and 7 May 2014 reconfirming respondent no.5&apos;s appointment. Holding
			<lb />
			of such a meeting is although disputed by the petitioner, however, the
			<lb />
			same is not disputed by respondent no.8 and 9 who are whole-
			<lb />
			heartedly supporting the redevelopment at the hands of respondent
			<lb />
			no.5. In my opinion, the challenge to the General Body Meeting dated 7
			<lb />
			May 2014 by the petitioner before the AGRC did not appear to be on a
			<lb />
			sound footing inasmuch as the challenge was on the ground that the
			<lb />
			meeting was attended by two persons who are dead and that certain
			<lb />
			persons had signed the minutes of the meeting twice. The AGRC has
			<lb />
			recorded a finding of fact disapproving such assertion of the petitioner
			<lb />
			that if these meager number of slum dwellers if are to be excluded from
			<lb />
			the said meeting, it would certainly show that the others had agreed to
			<lb />
			continue their support to respondent no.5. These observations of the
			<lb />
			AGRC are as under:-

			&quot;With regard to documents at Serial No. (iv) to (vi) the
			<lb />
			contention raised by Applicant New Janta SRA CHS (P) that
			<lb />
			four Slum Dwellers whose signatures appear in the General
			<lb />
			Body Meeting dated 3 rd May 2014, 4 th May 2014 and 7 th May
			<lb />
			2014 passed by the respective Societies, had already expired.
			<lb />
			This Committee is of the view that even if this contention is
			<lb />
			correct then also it would make negligible difference in the
			<lb />
			81% of consent given by the eligible Slum Dwellers to
			<lb />
			Respondent No.3 Shree Nidhi Concept Realtors Pvt. Ltd.
			<lb />
			Further contention of the Applicant New Janta SRA CHS (P)
			<lb />
			that there are several instances where one person has signed
			<lb />
			twice for himself and several others and Slum Dwellers whose
			<lb />
			names are started to have been present at the meeting,
			<lb />
			however their names do not feature/appear in Certified
			<lb />
			Annexure-II issued by the Concerned Authority are vague
			<lb />
			statements.
			<lb />
			However by the said Special General Body Resolution dated
			<lb />
			3 rd May 2014, 4 th May 2014 and 7 th May 2014 passed by
			<lb />
			respective committee members of the said societies have re-
			<lb />
			confirmed the appointment of Respondent No.3 Shree Nidhi
			<lb />
			Concept Realtors Pvt Ltd.
			<lb />
			Therefore this Committee is of view that there is no
			<lb />
			question of remanding the matter back to CEO/SRA for
			<lb />
			hearing in respect of the aforesaid seven documents as
			<lb />
			this committee has heard the concerned parties at length,
			<lb />
			therefore it will not achieve useful purpose but will
			<lb />
			further delay the implementation of S. R Scheme.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			214.
			<lb />
			The three societies on 15 May 2014 had in fact approached
			<lb />
			the Assistant Registrar, SRA for reservation of the co-operative society
			<lb />
			names. As informed by respondent no.5 to the petitioner and
			<lb />
			respondent nos.8 and 9, respondent no.5 on 6 June 2014 [which was
			<lb />
			prior to the expiry of the assurance as given by respondent no.5
			<lb />
			(Director Mr.Senghani) to the petitioner in the letter dated 10 April
			<lb />
			2014], applied to the SRA for issuance of a LOI..
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			215.
			<lb />
			It cannot be conceived that the letter of intent to be
			<lb />
			received from the authority is like respondent no.5 receiving something
			<lb />
			instantly across the counter. Thus, respondent no.5&apos;s letter dated 10
			<lb />
			April 2014 issued to the Society and more particularly assurances in the
			<lb />
			last paragraph, are required to be read in the context of the scheme of
			<lb />
			things, which effectively meant that appropriate steps would be taken
			<lb />
			by respondent no.5, so that a letter of intent can be received and an
			<lb />
			endeavour can be made to start the work. The petitioner&apos;s reading of
			<lb />
			the last paragraph of this letter of respondent no.5, that once before 30
			<lb />
			June 2014 respondent no.5 failed to receive a LOI, then it should give a
			<lb />
			NOC, is a total misreading of the said letter. The letter is required to be
			<lb />
			read in its entirety and not in bits and pieces as sought to be done by
			<lb />
			the petitioner.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			216.
			<lb />
			However what was happening behind closed doors at the
			<lb />
			petitioner&apos;s end and the reason for the petitioner demanding an
			<lb />
			assurance as given by respondent no.5 in the letter dated 30 April
			<lb />
			2014, appeared to be something else and which comes to light when
			<lb />
			suddenly with no previous background of any complaint/representation
			<lb />
			to the SRA, the petitioner held a General Body Meeting on 15 June
			<lb />
			2014, terminating respondent no.5&apos;s appointment and instantly
			<lb />
			appointing respondent no.7-SLK Buildcon to be its developer.
			<lb />
			Admittedly, when such a meeting was held, the petitioner was only a
			<lb />
			proposed society. There was no observer of the SRA (Assistant
			<lb />
			Registrar, Co-operative Society SRA) appointed to remain present at
			<lb />
			such a meeting, as per the requirement of Circular No.80, issued by the
			<lb />
			SRA. On the basis of this resolution, the petitioner by letter dated 27
			<lb />
			June 2014 approached the CEO SRA informing of the appointment of
			<lb />
			respondent no.7-SLK Buildcon on the ground that since 2006
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 had not taken any steps for implementation of the
			<lb />
			slum scheme. The CEO SRA was requested to take further necessary
			<lb />
			steps in the matter within 15 days on receipt of the representation and
			<lb />
			recognize respondent no.7 SLK Buildcon as the new developer. In the
			<lb />
			meantime it appears that the Engineering Department had put up the
			<lb />
			proposal of respondent no.5 before the CEO SRA for approval of the
			<lb />
			draft LOI. The CEO SRA however did not take any decision on the
			<lb />
			proposal and instead directed the Assistant Registrar to call for a
			<lb />
			meeting of the Society to ascertain whether respondent no.5 should be
			<lb />
			the developer or it should be the new developer so appointed. It
			<lb />
			appears that this was wholly unwarranted to delay the decision on the
			<lb />
			LOI.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			217.
			<lb />
			Be that as it may the Assistant Registrar accordingly
			<lb />
			informed the petitioner and respondent nos. 8 and 9, of its decision to
			<lb />
			hold General Body meetings by his letter dated 15 July 2014. This was
			<lb />
			the starting point of the first round of litigation. The Chief Promoters
			<lb />
			challenged the communication dated 15 July 2014 of the Assistant
			<lb />
			Registrar by filing Revision Application no.296, 297 and 298 of 2014
			<lb />
			before the Divisional Joint Registrar under Section 154 of the Co-
			<lb />
			operative Societies Act. The Divisional Joint Registrar by an order dated
			<lb />
			11 September 2014 set aside the impugned communication dated 15
			<lb />
			July 2014. This decision of the Divisional Joint Registrar was
			<lb />
			challenged before this Court in Writ Petition nos.8410, 8412 and 8413
			<lb />
			of 2014 before this Court. By a judgment and order dated 18 April
			<lb />
			2015 this Court allowed the said writ petitions by setting aside the
			<lb />
			order dated 11 September 2014 passed by the Divisional Joint
			<lb />
			Registrar.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			218.
			<lb />
			Apart from the above litigation, the Chief promoters of
			<lb />
			these three societies as also respondent no.5 challenged the decision of
			<lb />
			the CEO SRA dated 14 July 2014, to the effect that the Engineering
			<lb />
			Department&apos;s proposal to take a decision on the LOI, be deferred after
			<lb />
			the meetings of the societies are held, by filing proceedings before the
			<lb />
			High Power Committee being application nos.3 and 4 of 2015. On 5
			<lb />
			March 2015 HPC by a reasoned decision set aside the orders dated 14
			<lb />
			July 2014 of the CEO-SRA to postpone the meetings and directed the
			<lb />
			CEO SRA to take a decision on the proposal of respondent no.5 for
			<lb />
			issuance of a LOI. The High Power Committee in so directing held that
			<lb />
			the General Body Resolution of the petitioner dated 15 June 2014 was
			<lb />
			illegal and in violation of Circular 80 of the SRA. It was also observed
			<lb />
			that the record indicated that respondent No.5 had consent of 82% of
			<lb />
			the eligible slum dwellers and that there was no willful delay on the
			<lb />
			part of respondent no.5. This order passed by the High Power
			<lb />
			Committee was challenged before this Court in writ petition nos.673
			<lb />
			and 674 of 2015 filed by respondent no.8-Hind Ekta. The Division
			<lb />
			Bench of this Court by an order dated 21 September 2015 dismissed
			<lb />
			both the said writ petitions interalia directing the CEO SRA to take a
			<lb />
			decision uninfluenced by the observations and conclusions in the orders
			<lb />
			passed by the High Power Committee and including the orders of this
			<lb />
			Court. The Division Bench also has commented in its order as noted
			<lb />
			above that the SRA delayed taking decision on respondent No.5&apos;s
			<lb />
			proposal.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			219.
			<lb />
			Thereafter the CEO SRA initiated steps to hold elections of
			<lb />
			the three societies. On 17 th December, 2015 the CEO directed that
			<lb />
			elections be held of all the three societies and opined that if newly
			<lb />
			elected managing committees separately or a single managing
			<lb />
			committee submits any application to the SRA then decision would be
			<lb />
			taken on the applications as per rules. This initiated further litigation
			<lb />
			in as much as again applications were filed before High Power
			<lb />
			Committee praying for setting aside of the communication dated 17
			<lb />
			December, 2015 issued by the CEO SRA and that the Assistant Registrar
			<lb />
			be restrained from holding proposed General Body Meetings.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			220.
			<lb />
			However, during the pendency of the above proceedings
			<lb />
			the SRA processed the proposal of respondent no.5. A financial
			<lb />
			certification of respondent no. 5 (Annexure III) was issued by the SRA
			<lb />
			in favour of respondent no. 5 on 4 February 2016. This on the
			<lb />
			background of respondent no. 5 making payment of Rs.8,89,06,000/-
			<lb />
			to the SRA towards land premium payable in respect of the scheme and
			<lb />
			also a bank guarantee of Rs.3.11 crores being furnished to the SRA.
			<lb />
			Consequently, on 5 February 2016 a Letter of Intent (LOI) was issued
			<lb />
			by the SRA in favour of respondent no. 5 to undertake the slum scheme
			<lb />
			in question for the three societies. However, the same was interalia
			<lb />
			with one of the following condition:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;This LOI will have no bearing whatsoever on any parallel proceeding under
			<lb />
			any section of the Maharashtra Slum Areas (I.C. &amp; R) Act 1971.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			221.
			<lb />
			On 17 March 2016 General Body Meeting of the petitioner
			<lb />
			was held by the Assistant Registrar and the managing committee was
			<lb />
			elected. Similarly such meetings were held for respondent nos.8 and 9.
			<lb />
			The Managing Committee of the petitioner thereafter on 26 March
			<lb />
			2016 held a meeting whereby it ratified the earlier General Body
			<lb />
			Resolution dated 15 July 2014 to remove respondent no. 5 and appoint
			<lb />
			respondent no. 7 SLK Buildcon. It needs to be noted that General Body
			<lb />
			Meeting of the petitioner-society dated 15 June 2014 was observed to
			<lb />
			be not in accordance with Circular 80 by the High Power Committee in
			<lb />
			its decision dated 5 March 2015 and as upheld by the Division Bench of
			<lb />
			this Court in its decision dated 21 September 2015 in WP (L) 673 and
			<lb />
			674 of 2015 and thus the said General Body Meeting of the petitioner
			<lb />
			society could not be of any relevance.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			222.
			<lb />
			There was a further litigation in as much as the Chief
			<lb />
			Promoter of the petitioner now filed Application No. 83 of 2016 before
			<lb />
			the High Power Committee (AGRC) interalia praying for setting aside
			<lb />
			of the Letter of Intent (LOI) dated 5 February 2016 issued in favour of
			<lb />
			respondent nos. 5 and 6 and also making a prayer that the SRA be
			<lb />
			directed to terminate appointment of respondent no. 5 for inordinate
			<lb />
			delay. There was another prayer that the SRA be directed to carve out
			<lb />
			the petitioner&apos;s plot of land from the LOI issued in favour of respondent
			<lb />
			no. 5. This application of the petitioner before the HPC indicates the
			<lb />
			petitioner&apos;s disassociation with respondent nos. 8 and 9 and its
			<lb />
			contention that the petitioner should be treated independent of
			<lb />
			respondent no. 8 and 9 in regard to the slum rehabilitation scheme in
			<lb />
			question.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			223.
			<lb />
			Despite approaching the High Power Committee in the
			<lb />
			aforesaid application filed on 1 April 2016, the petitioner filed an
			<lb />
			independent application with the CEO SRA under section 13(2) of the
			<lb />
			Slums Act interalia praying for similar reliefs namely that appointment
			<lb />
			of respondent no. 5 be terminated for inordinate delay to the extent of
			<lb />
			undertaking redevelopment qua the petitioner&apos;s society and that the
			<lb />
			Engineering Department be directed to carve out petitioner&apos;s plot of
			<lb />
			land from LOI and not to entertain any applications of respondent nos.
			<lb />
			5 and 6.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			224.
			<lb />
			The CEO SRA by the impugned order dated 17 May 2016
			<lb />
			rejected the petitioner&apos;s application filed under section 13(2). This
			<lb />
			order (impugned order no. 1) passed by the CEO SRA was challenged
			<lb />
			by the petitioner before the High Power Committee (AGRC) in
			<lb />
			Application No. 110 of 2016 which was filed on 19 May 2016 which
			<lb />
			came to be adjudicated by the impugned order dated 11 January 2018,
			<lb />
			which also decided the earlier application no. 83 of 2016 filed by the
			<lb />
			petitioner whereby both these applications came to be dismissed
			<lb />
			leading to the filing of the present petitions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			225.
			<lb />
			The AGRC in the impugned order dated 11 January 2018
			<lb />
			considering the factual matrix and the documents has recorded a
			<lb />
			finding that there were impediments in implementation of the slum
			<lb />
			scheme in question due to the CRZ issues, reservations etc. It was also
			<lb />
			held that once it is a composite scheme to carve out the petitioner&apos;s plot
			<lb />
			was not a feasible proposition.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			226.
			<lb />
			The above conspectus of facts in my opinion would not
			<lb />
			indicate that there was any defiant neglect on the part of respondent
			<lb />
			no. 5 requiring it to be removed as a developer on the ground of
			<lb />
			inordinate delay as alleged before the authorities by the petitioner.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			227.
			<lb />
			In my opinion, having noted in detail these facts, this is a
			<lb />
			case where the petitioners are to be themselves blamed to delay the
			<lb />
			redevelopment having resorted to infighting and unwarranted
			<lb />
			litigation, possibly at every stage. The two factions being created in the
			<lb />
			petitioner society as also within respondent nos. 8 and 9 and their
			<lb />
			actions of not being united has severely affected their own project. It is
			<lb />
			unfortunate that the slum dwellers fell prey of being misguided and
			<lb />
			mislead at the hands of few amongst them who were to ruin the
			<lb />
			prospects of early redevelopment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			228.
			<lb />
			It is a clear position on record that now the petitioner is a
			<lb />
			lone crusader against respondent nos. 5 and 6. Respondent nos. 8 and
			<lb />
			9 having fallen apart and are strongly supporting respondent nos. 5
			<lb />
			and 6. Thus the situation is such that in a composite scheme where all
			<lb />
			the three societies initially stood together, and when much progress
			<lb />
			was being made on the official front at the hands of respondent nos. 5
			<lb />
			who spent substantial amounts, the request of the petitioner to carve
			<lb />
			out the petitioners plot and permit the petitioner to re-undertake the
			<lb />
			entire exercise by the newly appointed developer-respondent no. 7, was
			<lb />
			wholly unjustified and unwarranted as rightly held by both the
			<lb />
			authorities below.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			229.
			<lb />
			The Court also cannot be unmindful that LOI is already
			<lb />
			issued in favour of respondent no.5 on 5 February 2016. Further also a
			<lb />
			permission is granted to commence construction of rehabilitation
			<lb />
			buildings. Respondent no. 5 had paid the second installment of
			<lb />
			Rs.15,56,00,000/-towards 25% of the land premium to the SRA. The
			<lb />
			first installment of 8.89 crores was paid on 25 January 2016. Further
			<lb />
			on 8 March 2017 a revised LOI was issued in favour of respondent no.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			5. This apart on 12 May 2017 the State Environment Assessment
			<lb />
			Authority also issued a environmental clearance in favour of
			<lb />
			respondent no. 5 and after the impugned orders passed by the AGRC
			<lb />
			on 22 February 2018 a commencement certificate was granted for
			<lb />
			rehabilitation of building no. 1.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			230.
			<lb />
			It needs to be observed that the powers conferred on the
			<lb />
			SRA to consider an application under section 13(2) are required to be
			<lb />
			exercised considering the totality of the facts and circumstances of the
			<lb />
			case. The slum dwellers who have a limited right to have a permanent
			<lb />
			alternate accommodation once having appointed a developer, the
			<lb />
			legislature has left it to the due consideration of the SRA to consider as
			<lb />
			to whether a genuine case is made out to remove the developer who
			<lb />
			was appointed by nobody but the very slum dwellers who have moved
			<lb />
			the SRA for the change of the developer. As observed the developer
			<lb />
			cannot be changed at the whims and fancies of the slum dwellers or
			<lb />
			their co-operative societies. It certainly cannot be so casual as in a
			<lb />
			given case the developer having changed his position would be faced
			<lb />
			with civil consequences causing him a serious prejudice although in a
			<lb />
			contractual set up with the slum society. It is therefore a onerous task
			<lb />
			for the SRA to examine the case carefully before passing any order
			<lb />
			under section 13(2) of the Slums Act. The legislative intent in
			<lb />
			providing the powers under section 13(2) is neither to generate any
			<lb />
			private contractual litigation nor to give rise to any litigation on the
			<lb />
			slum scheme. The object of the legislation is to bring about an
			<lb />
			improvement and clearance of the slums and their effective
			<lb />
			redevelopment so as to uplift the slum dwellers from unhygienic and
			<lb />
			substandard living conditions and provide them a decent
			<lb />
			accommodation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			231.
			<lb />
			In these circumstances, the reliance on behalf of the
			<lb />
			petitioner on the decision of Division Bench of this Court in Hi Tech
			<lb />
			India Construction vs. Chief Executive Officer, Slum Rehabilitation
			<lb />
			Authority (supra) would not assist the petitioners. Moreover, this
			<lb />
			decision in paragraph 17 holds that if the decision of SRA or High
			<lb />
			Power Committee, if is a possible view, and if the petitioners are unable
			<lb />
			to establish their case on any malafides or otherwise, the finding of the
			<lb />
			authorities should not be interfered. Admittedly this is not the case
			<lb />
			where malafides are pleaded by the petitioner much less proved. The
			<lb />
			findings as recorded by both the authorities are borne out by the
			<lb />
			record. Both the authorities have taken a holistic view of the matter on
			<lb />
			this count.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			232.
			<lb />
			In any event, the petitioners in my opinion ought not to
			<lb />
			have been so bold to make prayers to carve out their plot, from the
			<lb />
			composite scheme, as if they are the owners of the land, when the land
			<lb />
			itself belongs to the State Government and when the slum dwellers
			<lb />
			would have a limited right to be re-housed in the redeveloped
			<lb />
			premises. Hence, such a prayer for carving out of the plot as made by
			<lb />
			the petitioner was most inappropriate.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			233.
			<lb />
			It is often seen that slum dwellers on public land in the city
			<lb />
			of Mumbai are left completely misguided, uncontrolled and
			<lb />
			directionless in the absence of the public bodies or the Government
			<lb />
			extending their helping hand to do anything for them. In fact the entire
			<lb />
			decision to deal with this land was graciously left by the Government at
			<lb />
			the discretion of the slum dwellers who in turn are left playing at the
			<lb />
			hands of extraneous elements, when it came to redevelopment of the
			<lb />
			slums. The Government negligently does not play any role to
			<lb />
			safeguard such prime land and encroachments being consciously
			<lb />
			overlooked by the otherwise strong Government machinery, these lands
			<lb />
			become notified and protected slums. Still the Government turns a
			<lb />
			blind eye to take steps to alleviate the slums and resettle the slum
			<lb />
			dwellers, so that they can be accommodated to live in human
			<lb />
			conditions. In fact such neglect and apathy on the part of the
			<lb />
			authorities has brought about this precarious situation of the city
			<lb />
			facing large slums. Thus, eminently there is an urgent requirement of a
			<lb />
			robust institutional framework and effective steps to be taken so that
			<lb />
			the objective of proper urban planning leading to social and economic
			<lb />
			development can be achieved. It is for this reason this Court in Galaxy
			<lb />
			Enterprises vs. State Maharashtra 68
			<lb />
			has made the following
			<lb />
			observations:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;3.
			<lb />
			There is a wealth of decisions of the Supreme Court and this
			<lb />
			Court emphasizing on the expeditious and effective rehabilitation of slum
			<lb />
			dwellers, who live in inhuman conditions, so as to achieve in letter and
			<lb />
			spirit, the object and intention of a fairly old State legislation namely the
			<lb />
			&quot;Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement , Clearance and Redevelopment)
			<lb />
			Act 1971&quot;. Nonetheless, considering the volumes of disputes still reaching
			<lb />
			the Courts, it can certainly be said that time is ripe, if not too late, to
			<lb />
			ponder, whether things are realistically working in the right direction, to
			<lb />
			eradicate slums and rehabilitate the slum dwellers, with the desired
			<lb />
			efficacy and expedition. This not only at the hands of the authorities but
			<lb />
			also at the hands of the other stake holders. The vital issue which has often
			<lb />
			led to controversy and disputes, is on the rules permitting, the selection
			<lb />
			68 2019 SCC OnLine Bom 897
			<lb />
			and appointment of developers to undertake a Slum Rehabilitation
			<lb />
			Scheme, being conferred on the slum dwellers, who are hardly expected to
			<lb />
			know the nitty-gritty of the slum redevelopment schemes. It is seen that
			<lb />
			the so called leaders of the slum dwellers who are themselves in need to be
			<lb />
			rehabilitated, are often lured by developers and their agents, and once a
			<lb />
			developer is appointed, what normally prevails is a constant fear of
			<lb />
			incertitude and skepticism amongst the slum dwellers, leading to disputes
			<lb />
			on variety of issues affecting their final rehabilitation. Such issues not only
			<lb />
			frustrate the very object of a speedy slum redevelopment but completely
			<lb />
			derail the slum schemes. It can be seen that scores of slum schemes have
			<lb />
			remained incomplete for years together and are languishing on such
			<lb />
			issues, either in litigation before Courts and/or before the authorities.
			<lb />
			These schemes need not face such ordeal, including of an unending
			<lb />
			litigation. To change the developer is no answer as even this process
			<lb />
			involves dispute resolution and ultimately lengthy litigation from one
			<lb />
			forum to another.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;Can the Slum Rehabilitation Authority not have a robust panel of
			<lb />
			bonafide developers who have genuine business interest to redevelop
			<lb />
			slums, of course with commercial benefits as conferred under the rules,
			<lb />
			and who can be appointed by an open and fair scheme of selection and
			<lb />
			allotment of slum projects and who would be accountable to the
			<lb />
			Authority?&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			It is high time that learning from the past experiences, the burden on
			<lb />
			the ill equipped slum dwellers to be responsible to appoint developers and
			<lb />
			pursue the redevelopment scheme is removed and to do away the ordeal
			<lb />
			of the slum dwellers to go on knocking the doors of different authorities
			<lb />
			for years together when the developers fail to perform. The redevelopment
			<lb />
			to be undertaken professionally and in a time bound manner is the need
			<lb />
			of the day, even to fulfill the ideals which the Government intends to
			<lb />
			achieve. What is necessary is the initiative of a redevelopment, by genuine,
			<lb />
			honest and trustworthy developers appointed through the Slum Authority
			<lb />
			or any other Special Body created for the said purpose and not to leave it
			<lb />
			to the slum dwellers to re-develop the slums. This for the reason that the
			<lb />
			slum dwellers are supposed to be merely interested in their rehabilitation
			<lb />
			and can have no other interest. All these efforts are necessary, as a step
			<lb />
			forward to achieve an object of having an ideal city free of slums. It
			<lb />
			cannot be countenanced that the slums be redeveloped only when the
			<lb />
			slum dwellers feel the need of a redevelopment and the Government
			<lb />
			Authorities cannot initiate redevelopment and cannot initiate a suo motu
			<lb />
			action in that behalf. It is hence, for the Government and the Slum
			<lb />
			Authority to give its anxious consideration to these issues and in its
			<lb />
			wisdom to device a substantial, nay a full proof mechanism by undertaking
			<lb />
			a study and identify these grey areas, so that the helping hand as extended
			<lb />
			by the legislature in providing this beneficial law as far back in 1971 that is
			<lb />
			almost 50 years back is held strongly and firmly by all concerned. It is
			<lb />
			never too late.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>

			<lb />
			For the above reasons, question no. 3 is required to be
			<lb />
			answered in the negative confirming the findings of the authorities, as I
			<lb />
			find that there is neither a delay nor any willful delay on the part of
			<lb />
			respondent no. 5 to undertake the slum scheme as held by the
			<lb />
			authorities.

			<lb />
			Q.IV Whether the orders passed by the Chief Executive
			<lb />
			Officer-SRA on the petitioner&apos;s application under Section 13(2) and as
			<lb />
			confirmed by the AGRC, are in any manner vitiated on the ground of
			<lb />
			breach of principles of natural justice ?
			<lb />
			On this count the impugned orders are interalia being
			<lb />
			assailed by the petitioner primarily on the following contentions:-
			<lb />
			That the general body resolution dated 3 May 2014, 4 May
			<lb />
			2014 and 7 May 2014 (Petitioner&apos;s society&apos;s resolution) of the Societies
			<lb />
			were not part of the record before the CEO-SRA as they were placed on
			<lb />
			record by an application dated 8 May 2014 received by CEO on 9 May
			<lb />
			2014, which was after the CEO SRA closing the hearing on the Section
			<lb />
			13(2) application on 5 May 2016. It is contended that there is a breach
			<lb />
			of the principles of natural justice in the CEO SRA taking these GBRs
			<lb />
			into consideration. That these were false and fabricated documents, as
			<lb />
			several individuals have signed twice and some persons who have
			<lb />
			signed had already expired. These resolutions were not earlier pressed
			<lb />
			into service in the previous round of litigation and therefore, surely
			<lb />
			these were fabricated documents. These resolutions in any case could
			<lb />
			not have been relied by the CEO SRA in passing the impugned order, as
			<lb />
			subsequent meeting was held on 15 June 2014 by the petitioner, when
			<lb />
			the appointment of respondent nos.5 and 6 was terminated. Even the
			<lb />
			AGRC has failed to render any findings on the contention of
			<lb />
			fabrication. Respondent nos.5 and 6 justifying that such resolutions
			<lb />
			were passed, cannot be accepted in view of the decision of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in Mohinder Singh Gill &amp; Anr. Vs. The Chief Election
			<lb />
			Commissioner, New Delhi &amp; Ors. (supra). Even AGRC has erred in not
			<lb />
			accepting the petitioner&apos;s contention that breach of the principles of
			<lb />
			natural justice could not have been remedied in the appeal before
			<lb />
			AGRC. The AGRC ought to have remanded the matter back to CEO
			<lb />
			SRA/respondent no.2. The petitioner has contended that respondent
			<lb />
			no.5 could not have been appointed on the day when initial resolutions
			<lb />
			were passed appointing respondent no.5 as the developer on 3 June
			<lb />
			2006, 9 June 2006 and 15 June 2006 as Respondent no.5 was not
			<lb />
			incorporated as a company. This aspect has been completely overlooked
			<lb />
			by both the authorities.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			236.
			<lb />
			Thus broadly it is the petitioner&apos;s contention that there is a
			<lb />
			breach of principles of natural justice when copies of the said GBRs
			<lb />
			were not supplied to the petitioner and nonetheless referred by the
			<lb />
			CEO SRA in his order. The petitioner has contended that the order of
			<lb />
			CEO SRA would stand vitiated being in breach of the principles of
			<lb />
			natural justice by referring to these GBRs, copies of which were placed
			<lb />
			on record subsequent to closing of hearing by CEO SRA. The petitioner
			<lb />
			contends that even if the AGRC has considered the petitioner&apos;s
			<lb />
			challenge on this issue, nonetheless the initial breach of the principles
			<lb />
			of natural justice cannot be cured even if the remedy to assail the order
			<lb />
			passed by the CEO SRA, was available to the petitioner before the
			<lb />
			AGRC. In short, the contention is that a fair appeal would not cure an
			<lb />
			unfair trial. This argument is strongly supported on behalf of the
			<lb />
			petitioner relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in Institute of
			<lb />
			Chartered Accountants of India Vs. L.K.Ratna &amp; Ors. (supra).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			237.
			<lb />
			The Court is required to consider these contentions as
			<lb />
			urged on behalf of the petitioner on two counts, firstly, whether the
			<lb />
			facts indicate any breach of principles of natural justice and secondly,
			<lb />
			on the legal principle as urged on behalf of the petitioner, referring to
			<lb />
			the decision in Institute of Chartered Accountants of India Vs.
			<lb />
			L.K.Ratna &amp; Ors. (supra).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			238.
			<lb />
			In so far as the first count, the petitioner&apos;s contention that
			<lb />
			there is breach of principles of natural justice on the ground that the
			<lb />
			petitioner had no opportunity to deal with the three General Body
			<lb />
			Resolutions dated 3 May 2014, 4 May 2014 and 7 May 2014, in my
			<lb />
			opinion, this contention of the petitioner cannot be accepted for more
			<lb />
			than one reason. In the impugned order dated 11 May 2016 passed by
			<lb />
			the CEO SRA, it has been clearly recorded and as a matter of fact, on
			<lb />
			behalf of respondent no.5 these three resolutions were referred during
			<lb />
			the course of the submissions, when no objection was taken on behalf
			<lb />
			of the petitioner. The CEO SRA in this regard has made the following
			<lb />
			observations:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			Now the question arises as to when there is no wilful
			<lb />
			delay the Respondent No.3 should be terminated or not on the
			<lb />
			request of Applicant society. In this regard Advocate Joglekar
			<lb />
			for Respondent No.3 submitted that Applicant and as well as
			<lb />
			other two societies repose confidence in Respondent No.3 and
			<lb />
			ratified all the agreements, Power of Attorney and other
			<lb />
			documents executed in favour of Respondent No.3 in the year
			<lb />
			2006 by passing Resolution in the month of May 2014 and
			<lb />
			surprisingly within a period of two months all these societies
			<lb />
			passed a Resolution for termination of Respondent No.3. The
			<lb />
			copies of Resolutions passed by Applicant society and two
			<lb />
			other societies on 04/05/2014, 03/05/2014 and 07/05/2014 are
			<lb />
			submitted on record. From these copies it appears that all the
			<lb />
			three societies have ratified the appointment of Respondent
			<lb />
			No.3 as developer.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			From these facts there appear to be much
			<lb />
			substance in submission of Advocate for Respondent
			<lb />
			No.3 that all the three societies passed Resolution in the
			<lb />
			month of June 2014 for termination of Respondent No.3
			<lb />
			as developer at the instance of rival developer who
			<lb />
			wanted to take over the subject S.R. Scheme due to the
			<lb />
			Resolution of MCZMA dated 31/01/2014.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			239.
			<lb />
			The second reason being that the said resolutions were
			<lb />
			relevant in the context of the contention as urged on behalf of
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 that it has support of all the three societies. In my
			<lb />
			opinion, in view of the clear factual position which was available on
			<lb />
			record that respondent nos.8 and 9 supported respondent no.5 to be a
			<lb />
			developer, and as to what happened subsequent to the General Body
			<lb />
			meeting held on 7 May 2014 (petitioner&apos;s GBR), it cannot be said that
			<lb />
			there was any breach of the principles of natural justice. Further, even
			<lb />
			assuming that these documents of GBR were not available to the
			<lb />
			petitioner, it has not caused any prejudice to the petitioner so as to
			<lb />
			make such a complaint.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			240.
			<lb />
			Even the contention of the petitioner that these GBR&apos;s are
			<lb />
			false and fabricated, cannot be accepted. The AGRC has rightly
			<lb />
			observed that merely because there are some persons who have signed
			<lb />
			twice (not a substantial majority to change the nature of these GBR&apos;s)
			<lb />
			or in place of names of two dead persons there are signatures made,
			<lb />
			which are explained to be the signatures of the legal representatives of
			<lb />
			these dead persons. These factual observations cannot be held to be
			<lb />
			perverse, to label these documents as fabricated.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			241.
			<lb />
			I am also unable to agree with the petitioner&apos;s submission
			<lb />
			that there is any breach of principles of natural justice for the reasons
			<lb />
			of these documents not being furnished to them, for the reason that the
			<lb />
			remedy before the AGRC is the remedy of a full-fledged appeal which is
			<lb />
			a continuation of the proceeding before the CEO-SRA, in which the
			<lb />
			AGRC has entertained issues which were not canvassed by the
			<lb />
			petitioner even before the CEO SRA. The AGRC has considered the
			<lb />
			case of the petitioner on the breach of the principles of natural justice
			<lb />
			and whether there was any prejudice which was caused to the
			<lb />
			petitioner by not furnishing the documents, as placed on record by
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 before the CEO-SRA on 5 May 2016. Once on the
			<lb />
			petitioner&apos;s appeal an opportunity of a proper hearing was granted to
			<lb />
			the petitioner, on all the counts and a decision is rendered it cannot be
			<lb />
			said that the breach of principles of natural justice remains
			<lb />
			unremedied.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			242.
			<lb />
			It needs to be observed that the AGRC has complete
			<lb />
			powers as an appellate authority to consider all the issues touching the
			<lb />
			dispute even if they were not raised before the CEO-SRA, as can be
			<lb />
			clearly seen from the Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement,
			<lb />
			Clearance and Redevelopment) Grievance Redressal Committee Rules
			<lb />
			2014 (for short &apos;the AGRC Rules 2014&apos;) and more particularly Rule 6, 7
			<lb />
			and 8. It would be appropriate to note the relevant provisions of the
			<lb />
			Slums Act pertaining to constitution of AGRC and AGRC Rules to
			<lb />
			appreciate the nature of the jurisdiction being exercised by the AGRC.

			<lb />
			It is thus clear that the jurisdiction of the AGRC is that of
			<lb />
			an appellate authority and a person who is aggrieved by any of the
			<lb />
			decision or direction of the Competent Authority-CEO SRA, can
			<lb />
			maintain an appeal before the AGRC. This apart Section 35(1A)(b)
			<lb />
			clearly provides that any order passed under Section 13 of the Slums
			<lb />
			Act against an owner or developer not undertaking and completing the
			<lb />
			project as per the permission and approval as also within the stipulated
			<lb />
			time frame, can approach the AGRC which would exercise appellate
			<lb />
			powers. Sub-section (5) of Section 35 clearly provides that the decision
			<lb />
			of the Grievance Redressal Committee on appeal shall be final and shall
			<lb />
			not be questioned in any Court. It is well established that an appeal is
			<lb />
			continuation of a trial proceedings. This would entitle a person
			<lb />
			aggrieved by an order passed by the Competent Authority -CEO SRA
			<lb />
			to urge all contentions before the AGRC and the AGRC would have
			<lb />
			authority and jurisdiction to set aside such orders. This would also
			<lb />
			mean that the AGRC can look into the contentions even of breach of
			<lb />
			principles of natural justice at the hands of the competent authority. In
			<lb />
			this context it would be profitable to note the observations of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in Kamla Devi V. Kushal Kanwar &amp; Anr. wherein it is
			<lb />
			observed that an appeal is a continuation of the original proceedings.
			<lb />
			In effect when the entire proceedings being before the Appellate
			<lb />
			Authority, it would certainly have an authority and jurisdiction to
			<lb />
			review the evidence. It was observed that a right of appeal carries with
			<lb />
			it a right of rehearing on law as well as facts, unless the statute
			<lb />
			conferring the right of appeal limits the rehearing in some way. The
			<lb />
			Court in this context in paragraphs 12, 13 and 15 has observed thus:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;12. An appeal, as is well known, is the right of entering a superior court
			<lb />
			invoking its aid and interposition to redress an error of the Court below. The
			<lb />
			central idea behind filing of an appeal revolves round the right as contra-
			<lb />
			distinguished from the procedure laid down therefor.

			This Court in Hoosein Kasam Dada (India) Ltd. v. The State of
			<lb />
			Madhya Pradesh and Others 69 , opined (AIR p.224, para8):
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;8. The above decisions quite firmly establish and our decisions
			<lb />
			in Janardan Reddy v. The State and in Ganpat Rai v. Agarwal
			<lb />
			Chamber of Commerce Ltd., uphold the principle that a right of
			<lb />
			appeal is not merely a matter of procedure. It is matter of
			<lb />
			substantive right. This right of appeal from the decision of an
			<lb />
			inferior tribunal to a superior tribunal becomes vested in a party
			<lb />
			when proceedings are first initiated in, and before a decision is
			<lb />
			given by, the inferior court. In the language of Jenkins C.J. in
			<lb />
			Nana Bin Aba V. Sheku Bin Andu to disturb an existing right of
			<lb />
			appeal is not a mere alteration in procedure. Such a vested right
			<lb />
			cannot be taken away except by express enactment or necessary
			<lb />
			intendment. An intention to interfere with or to impair or
			<lb />
			imperil such a vested right cannot be presumed unless such
			<lb />
			intention be clearly manifested by express words or necessary
			<lb />
			implication.&quot;

			<lb />
			&quot;17. Right of appeal is statutory. Right of appeal inherits in no
			<lb />
			one. When conferred by statute it becomes a vested right. In
			<lb />
			this regard there is essential distinction between right of appeal
			<lb />
			and right of suit. Where there is inherent right in every person
			<lb />
			to file a suit and for its maintainability it requires no authority
			<lb />
			of law, appeal requires so. As was observed in The State of
			<lb />
			Kerala v. K.M. Charia Abdulla and Co., the distinction between
			<lb />
			right appeal and revision is based on differences implicit in the
			<lb />
			two expressions. An appeal is continuation of the proceedings;
			<lb />
			in effect the entire proceedings are before the appellate
			<lb />
			authority and it has power to review the evidence subject to
			<lb />
			statutory limitations prescribed. But in the case of revision,
			<lb />
			whatever powers the revisional authority may or may not have,
			<lb />
			it has no power to review the evidence, unless the statute
			<lb />
			expressly confers on it that power. .. .. .. .&quot;

			These principles are also recognized in the subsequent

			Administration, Gorakhpur Vs. Bhagwan Das (Dead) By LRS. (supra)

			<lb />
			I am not persuaded to accept the submission as urged on
			<lb />
			behalf of the petitioner that even assuming that the trial was not a fair
			<lb />
			trial before the CEO SRA and/or it was in the breach of the principles
			<lb />
			of natural justice, the remedy and/or an opportunity of an appeal, did
			<lb />
			not cure the defect of an unfair trial. The law in this regard as
			<lb />
			discussed hereafter has undergone a substantial change. The decision
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court in Institute of Chartered Accountants of India Vs.
			<lb />
			L.K.Ratna &amp; Ors. (supra) would be required to be considered in the
			<lb />
			facts of that case. Considering the principles in this regard as laid
			<lb />
			down in several other decisions, it cannot be said that an absolute legal
			<lb />
			principle prevails that an unfair trial can never be cured by a fair
			<lb />
			appeal. It will certainly depend upon the facts of each case. The
			<lb />
			principle of law which would emerge, is that even if there is a defect in
			<lb />
			the proceedings of a trial, on the ground of non compliance of
			<lb />
			principles of natural justice, and that if such a complaining party before
			<lb />
			the appellate authority, could urge all these contentions, which can be
			<lb />
			gone into by the Appellate Authority, then it would not be as a matter
			<lb />
			of absolute legal principle permissible for a person so complaining to
			<lb />
			contend that the breach persists and orders of the trial authority still
			<lb />
			stand vitiated being in breach of the principles of natural justice. This
			<lb />
			for the reason that the defect which had arisen in the initial
			<lb />
			proceedings stood remedied and cured in an appeal, before the
			<lb />
			appellate authority, which by hearing the party on such ground can
			<lb />
			pass appropriate orders.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			245.
			<lb />
			This apart now the principles of law are also well settled
			<lb />
			that it now cannot be a simplicitor complaint of the breach of principles
			<lb />
			of natural justice. What would go to the root of the matter is as to
			<lb />
			whether such breach as complained has caused any prejudice to the
			<lb />
			complainant. If there is no prejudice, and if it is seen that none of the
			<lb />
			rights of the complainant are affected, then surely it would not be
			<lb />
			permissible for such a person to then urge such a plea, that merely
			<lb />
			because certain documents were not considered or he was not granted
			<lb />
			a hearing on a particular issue, it would render the order a nullity.
			<lb />
			Both the above principles can very well be discerned from the several
			<lb />
			decisions which I discuss herein below. Hence, the contention of the
			<lb />
			petitioner solely relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			Institute of Chartered Accountants of India Vs. L.K.Ratna &amp; Ors.
			<lb />
			(supra), in my opinion, is not well founded. The following discussion
			<lb />
			will aid the above proposition.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			246.
			<lb />
			In Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs. L.K.
			<lb />
			Ratna (supra) the Supreme Court was concerned with the legality of a
			<lb />
			disciplinary order against a Chartered Accountant, against whom there
			<lb />
			were allegations of a professional misconduct and whose professional
			<lb />
			reputation was at stake. If the initial order was to be upheld it would
			<lb />
			have caused a serious prejudice to him. It is in this context, the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court observed that the immediate consequence of the initial
			<lb />
			order was of importance and that the damage caused by the initial
			<lb />
			order was irreversible or could not have afforded a complete
			<lb />
			restitution, then the widest appellate power would not be sufficient to
			<lb />
			undo the damage. Referring to Leary vs. National Union of Vehicle
			<lb />
			Builders (supra) it was observed as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The view taken by Megarry, J. was followed by the Ontario High Court in
			<lb />
			Canada in Re Cardinal and Board of Commissioners of Police of City of
			<lb />
			Cornwall, [1974] 42 D.L.R. (3d) 323. The Supreme Court of New
			<lb />
			Zealand was similarly inclined in Wislang v. Medical Practioners
			<lb />
			Disciplinary Committee, [1974] 1 N.Z.L.R. 29 and so was the Court of
			<lb />
			Appeal of New Zealand in Reid v. Rowley, [1977] 2 N.Z.L.R. 472.
			<lb />
			But perhaps another way of looking at the matter lies in examining the
			<lb />
			consequences of the initial order as soon as it is passed. There are cases
			<lb />
			where an order may cause serious injury as soon as it is made, an injury
			<lb />
			not capable of being entirely erased when the error is corrected on
			<lb />
			subsequent appeal. For instance, as in the present case, where a member of
			<lb />
			a highly respected and publicly trusted profession is found guilty of
			<lb />
			misconduct and suffers penalty, the damage to his professional reputation
			<lb />
			can be immediate and far-reaching. &quot;Not all the King&apos;s horses and all the
			<lb />
			King&apos;s men&quot; can ever salvage the situation completely, notwithstanding the
			<lb />
			widest scope provided to an appeal. To many a man, his professional
			<lb />
			reputation is his most valuable possession. It affects his standing and
			<lb />
			dignity among his fellow members in the profession, and guarantees the
			<lb />
			esteem of his clientele. It is often the carefully garnered fruit of a long
			<lb />
			period of scrupulous, conscientious and diligent industry. It is the portrait
			<lb />
			of his professional honour. In a world said to be notorious for its blase
			<lb />
			attitude towards the noble values of an earlier generation, a man&apos;s
			<lb />
			professional reputation is still his most sensitive pride. In such a case, after
			<lb />
			the blow suffered by the initial decision, it is difficult to contemplate
			<lb />
			complete restitution through an appellate decision. Such a case is unlike
			<lb />
			an action for money or recovery of property, where the execution of the
			<lb />
			trial decree may be stayed pending appeal, or a successful appeal may
			<lb />
			result in refund of the money or restitution of the property, with
			<lb />
			appropriate compensation by way of interest or mesne profits for the
			<lb />
			period of deprivation. And, therefore, it seems to us, there is manifest need
			<lb />
			to ensure that there is no breach of fundamental procedure in the original
			<lb />
			proceeding, and to avoid treating an appeal as an overall substitute for the
			<lb />
			original proceeding.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			26.
			<lb />
			Upon the aforesaid considerations, we are of definite opinion that
			<lb />
			a member accused of misconduct is entitled to a hearing by the Council
			<lb />
			when, on receipt of the report of the Disciplinary Committee, it proceeds to
			<lb />
			find whether he is or is not guilty. The High Court is, therefore, right in the
			<lb />
			view on this point.&quot;
			<lb />
			Thus, the fulcrum of these observations is a immediate serious injury
			<lb />
			being caused by an initial order not capable of being entirely erased
			<lb />
			when the error is corrected in a subsequent appeal.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			247.
			<lb />
			The observations of Megarry J. in Leary vs. National Union
			<lb />
			of Vehicle Builders (supra) were reconsidered by the Privy Council in
			<lb />
			Ferd Dawson Calvin Vs. John Henry Brownlow Carr &amp; Ors. 71 in which
			<lb />
			71 (1980) a.c. 574
			<lb />
			the Privy Council held that the proposition was too broadly stated in
			<lb />
			Leary (supra) and it can be applicable only in some cases. The
			<lb />
			following observations are required to be noted:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The plaintiffs second argument can be stated, for purposes of
			<lb />
			description, as being that such defects of natural justice as may have
			<lb />
			existed as regards the proceedings before the stewards, were not
			<lb />
			capable of being cured by the appeal proceedings before the
			<lb />
			committee, even though, as was not contested before this Board, these
			<lb />
			were correctly and fairly conducted. The defendants contend the
			<lb />
			contrary. This part of the argument involved consideration of a wide
			<lb />
			range of authorities of this Board, and in Australia, Canada, England
			<lb />
			and New Zealand. As regards decisions of this Board of conflict was
			<lb />
			said to exist between Annamunthodo v. Oilfields Workers Trade Union
			<lb />
			1961 AC 945 and Pillai v. Singapore City Council 1968 1 W.L.R.
			<lb />
			1278, each of which has been followed by other decisions. There was
			<lb />
			also said to be a conflict between Annamunthodo&apos;s case, and the High
			<lb />
			Court in Australian Worker&apos;s Union v. Bowen (No.2) 77 C.L.R. 601, a
			<lb />
			conflict giving rise to difficulties for Australian State Courts. Other
			<lb />
			individual decisions were cited which it appears difficult to reconcile.
			<lb />
			Although, as will appear, some of the suggested inconsistencies of
			<lb />
			decisions disappear, or at least diminish, on analysis, their Lordship
			<lb />
			recognize and indeed assert that no clear and absolute rule can be
			<lb />
			laid down on the question whether defects in natural justice
			<lb />
			appearing at an original hearing, whether administrative or quasi-
			<lb />
			judicial, can be &quot;cured&quot; through appeal proceedings. The
			<lb />
			situation in which this issue arises are too diverse, and the rules by
			<lb />
			whether they are governed so various, that this must be so. There
			<lb />
			are, however, a number of typical situations as to which some
			<lb />
			general principle can be stated. First there are cases where the
			<lb />
			rules provide for a rehearing by the original body, or some fuller
			<lb />
			or enlarged form of it. This situation may be found in relation to
			<lb />
			social clubs. It is not difficult in such cases to reach the conclusion
			<lb />
			that the first hearing is superseded by the second, or, putting it in
			<lb />
			contractual terms, the parties are taken to have agreed to accept
			<lb />
			the decision of the hearing body, whether original or adjourned.
			<lb />
			Examples of this are De Verteuil v. Knaggs 1918 A.C. 557, Posluns v.
			<lb />
			Toronto Stock Exchange and Gardiner 1965 53 D.L.R. 193; In re dark
			<lb />
			and Onatario Securities Commission 1966 56 D.L.R. 585; In re
			<lb />
			Chromex Nickel Mines Ltd. 1970 16 D.L.R. 273; and see also Ridge v.
			<lb />
			Baldwin 1964 A.C. 40, per Lord Reid.
			<lb />
			At the other extreme are cases, where, after examination of the
			<lb />
			whole hearing structure, in the context of the particular activity to
			<lb />
			which it relates (trade union membership, planning, employment
			<lb />
			etc.) the conclusion is reached that a complainant has the right to
			<lb />
			nothing less than a fair hearing both at the original and at the
			<lb />
			appeal stage. This was the result reached by Megarry J. in Leary v.
			<lb />
			National Union of Vehicle Builders 1971 Ch. 34. In his judgment in
			<lb />
			that case the Judge seems to have elevated the conclusion thought
			<lb />
			proper in that case into a rule of general application. In an
			<lb />
			eloquent passage he said at p. 49;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&apos;If the rules and the law combine to give the member the right
			<lb />
			to a fair trial and the right of appeal, why should he be told
			<lb />
			that he ought to be satisfied with an unjust trial and a fair
			<lb />
			appeal? … … As a general rule … I hold that a failure of
			<lb />
			natural justice in the trial body cannot be cured by a
			<lb />
			sufficiency of natural justice in an appellate body.&apos;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			In their Lordships&apos; opinion this is too broadly stated. It affirms a
			<lb />
			principle which may be found correct in a category of cases: these
			<lb />
			may very well include trade union cases, where movement solidarity
			<lb />
			and dislike of the rebel, or renegade, may make it difficult for appeals
			<lb />
			to be conducted in an atmosphere of detached impartiality and so
			<lb />
			make a fair trial at the first -probably branch -level an essential
			<lb />
			condition of justice. But to seek to apply it generally overlooks, in
			<lb />
			their Lordships&apos; respectful opinion, both the existence of the first
			<lb />
			category, and the possibility that, intermediately, the conclusion to
			<lb />
			be reached, on the rules and on the contractual context, is that
			<lb />

			The Supreme Court in State Bank of Patiala and Ors. vs.
			<lb />
			S.K. Sharma (supra) has referred to Ferd Dawson Calvin vs. John
			<lb />
			Henry Brownlow Carr &amp; Ors. (supra) and has agreed with the Ferd
			<lb />
			Dawson Calvin principle. The Supreme Court observed as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			14. We may now consider the decision of the Privy Council in
			<lb />
			M.Vasudevan Pillai v. City Council of Singapore [1968 (1)
			<lb />
			W.L.R.1278]. The facts of this case are rather involved. The
			<lb />
			Singapore Municipal Ordinance provided that in a case of
			<lb />
			misconduct which in the opinion of the head of the department
			<lb />
			merited dismissal the head of the department should outline the
			<lb />
			case to the president or the deputy president and hold an enquiry.
			<lb />
			The record of enquiry shall thereafter be considered by the
			<lb />
			president or the deputy president who was entitled to cause such
			<lb />
			further enquiry as he may think appropriate and then make his
			<lb />
			final decision. If the decision was to dismiss the employee, the
			<lb />
			decision was to be conveyed by the head of the department to the
			<lb />
			employee who was given a right of appeal to the Establishments
			<lb />
			Committee. The appellants were daily rated unskilled labourers.
			<lb />
			On the allegation of misconducts an enquiry was held by the head
			<lb />
			of the department wherein the appellants participated.
			<lb />
			Thereafter, the deputy president asked certain questions from the
			<lb />
			head of the department and the latter supplied the necessary
			<lb />
			information. This was not disclosed to the appellants. They were
			<lb />
			dismissed. On appeals a de novo hearing was afforded to the
			<lb />
			appellants by the Establishments Committee. Thereupon the
			<lb />
			appellants brought an action in Singapore Courts which
			<lb />
			ultimately reached the Privy Council. he Privy Council recalled in
			<lb />
			the first instances the statement of law on this subject as stated by
			<lb />
			Lord Reid in Ridge v. Baldwin to the effect that unless the
			<lb />
			conditions of service are governed by a statute or statutory rules
			<lb />
			principles of natural justice have no place in a dispute between
			<lb />
			master and servant. The statement from Ridge runs thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The law regarding master and servant is not in doubt There
			<lb />
			cannot be specific performance of a contract of service, and the
			<lb />
			master can terminate the contract with his servant at any time
			<lb />
			and for any reason or for none But if he does so in a manner not
			<lb />
			warranted by the contract he must pay damages for breach of
			<lb />
			contract So the question in a pure case of master and servant
			<lb />
			does not at all depend on whether the master has heard-the
			<lb />
			servant in his own defence; it depends on whether the facts
			<lb />
			emerging at the trial prove breach of contract But this kind of
			<lb />
			case can resemble dismissal from an office where the body
			<lb />
			employing the man is under some statutory or other restriction
			<lb />
			as to the kind of contract which it can make with its servants, or
			<lb />
			the grounds on which it can dismiss them.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			15. On the facts of the appeal before them, the Privy Council held, in the first
			<lb />
			instance, that at the stage of the deputy president asking questions and the
			<lb />
			head of the department supplying him information, the principles of natural
			<lb />
			justice had no application. Alternately, they held that even if the said principles
			<lb />
			did apply, even then it must be held that the said violation was cured by what
			<lb />
			happened before the Establishments Committee [i.e., on appeal] Since there
			<lb />
			was a re-hearing before the Establishments Committee and evidence was
			<lb />
			called de novo and also because no grievance was made with to the
			<lb />
			proceedings before the Establishments Committee, the invalidity arising from
			<lb />
			the violation of principles of natural justice at the earlier stage was cured. This
			<lb />
			decision was referred with approval in 1980 by the Privy Council in Calvin v.
			<lb />
			Carr [1980 A.C.574] in the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Their Lordships regard this as a decision that in the context,
			<lb />
			namely one of regulations concerning establishments
			<lb />
			procedures, justice can be held to be done if, after all these
			<lb />
			procedures had been gone through, the dismissed person has
			<lb />
			had a fair hearing and put his case. It is thus an authority in
			<lb />
			favouring the existence of the intermediate category, but not
			<lb />
			necessarily one in favour of a general rule that first instance
			<lb />
			defects are cured by an appeal. Their Lordships are also of
			<lb />
			opinion that the phrase &apos;hearing of evidence de novo,&apos; though
			<lb />
			useful in that case, does not provide a universal solvent. What is
			<lb />
			required is examination of the hearing process, original and
			<lb />
			appeal as a whole, and a decision on the question whether after
			<lb />
			it has been gone through the complainant has had a fair deal of
			<lb />
			the kind that he bargained for.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			……. … … .
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Having considered the principles emerging from the above
			<lb />
			cases, we are inclined to say that the aforesaid statement of law
			<lb />
			in Calvin v. Carr, stated with reference to Vasudevan Pillai, is the
			<lb />
			appropriate one to adopt as a general rule -and we are
			<lb />
			supported by the decisions of this Court in saying so. We must s
			<lb />
			however, forewarn that decisions on the applicability of the
			<lb />
			principles of possible nor necessary to refer to all of them,
			<lb />
			particularly in view of the recent Constitution Bench judgments.
			<lb />
			We will refer only to a few of them to explain our view point.
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)

		<p>

			<lb />
			The decision in Ferd Dawson Calvin (supra) was also
			<lb />
			followed by a Full Bench of this Court, in Shantilal Ambalal Mehta vs.
			<lb />
			M.A. Rangaswamy (supra). The relevant observations of Shantilal
			<lb />
			Ambalal Mehta (supra) are as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;83. With respect, we find it difficult to accept the broad
			<lb />
			proposition enunciated in Megarry J.&apos;s judgment that a subsequent
			<lb />
			fair hearing by an appellate body does not cure the deficiency of
			<lb />
			natural justice in the trial body as being one of general
			<lb />
			application(...)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			86.
			<lb />
			Thus where a breach of the principles of natural justice is
			<lb />
			alleged, the question must firstly be judged in the light of the
			<lb />
			constitution of the statutory body which has to function in
			<lb />
			accordance with the rules laid down by the Legislature. Secondly,
			<lb />
			when there are no such rules or the rules, if any, are silent, there
			<lb />
			must be a minimum requirement which must be satisfied consisting
			<lb />
			of the person concerned being given an opportunity of making a
			<lb />
			representation or statement in respect of the charge against him to
			<lb />
			allay the suspicions of the authority competent to take action and
			<lb />
			thirdly, the person concerned must have a notice of the proceeding
			<lb />
			against him whether he chooses to appear or not. What is the
			<lb />
			nature of the hearing which is required to be given will vary
			<lb />
			according to the relevant rules applicable in each case, It is true
			<lb />
			that natural justice requires that &quot;no man shall be condemned
			<lb />
			unheard&quot;, but in finding out whether a breach of this rule has been
			<lb />
			committed or not, the scope of the enquiry has always been only
			<lb />
			whether the person concerned has been given a reasonable
			<lb />
			opportunity of being heard and whether nature of the opportunity
			<lb />
			given was sufficient to meet the requirements of natural justice in
			<lb />
			each case. (...) In most cases the powers of the appellate tribunals
			<lb />
			are co-extensive with the power and jurisdiction of the trial
			<lb />
			tribunal. If there is any defect in the proceeding of the trial tribunal
			<lb />
			arising out of violation or non-compliance with any of the
			<lb />
			principles of natural justice, and the appellate tribunal is under the
			<lb />
			appropriate rules empowered to cure that defect, it will be difficult
			<lb />
			for the person concerned to contend that the order of the trial
			<lb />
			tribunal should be totally ignored as a nullity on the ground that
			<lb />
			there has been a breach of the principles of natural justice before
			<lb />
			the trial tribunal.[...] It is not, therefore, possible for us to agree
			<lb />
			with the broad proposition made by Megarry J. that the deficiency
			<lb />
			of natural justice in the trial body could not be cured by any
			<lb />
			subsequent fair hearing by the appellate body and that the decision
			<lb />
			of the trial body should, therefore, be treated as void.

			<lb />
			of Canada in King v. University of Saskatchewan [1969] S.C.R.
			<lb />
			(Supreme Court of Canada) 678, in which Spence J. held that if
			<lb />
			there is an absence of natural justice in the inferior tribunals, it was
			<lb />
			cured by the presence of such natural justice before the Senate
			<lb />
			Appeal Committee. The view taken by Spence J. in this case did not
			<lb />
			appeal to Megarry J. in Leary&apos;s case and he declined to follow it.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			102.
			<lb />
			With respect, we agree with the reasoning of Spence J.
			<lb />
			which turned upon the construction of the provisions of the
			<lb />
			University Act having regard to which he took the view that if there
			<lb />
			were any absence of natural justice in the inferior tribunals, it was
			<lb />
			cured by the presence of such natural justice before the appeal
			<lb />
			committee because, as we have already pointed out, whether the
			<lb />
			breach complained of could be remedied in appeal was a matter
			<lb />
			which must be determined in the light of the relevant provisions or
			<lb />
			regulations dealing with the remedies and their scope open to a
			<lb />
			person who is affected by the decision complained of.&quot;

			In Air India Corporation vs. Richard Rashid Khan (supra)
			<lb />
			this Court allowed an appeal filed by Air India corporation against an
			<lb />
			order quashing the order of removal made by the General Manager of
			<lb />
			Air India, removing the respondent from service. The Court, referring
			<lb />
			to the judgment of the Full Bench in Shantilal Ambalal Mehta (supra)
			<lb />
			held as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			62. It may be pointed out that the decision of the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			Delhi Municipal Committee case, does not consider the question as
			<lb />
			to whether in a matter like the instant one, where there is an
			<lb />
			appellate authority which is capable of going into the question as to
			<lb />
			whether a person has been deprived of any opportunity to show
			<lb />
			cause and where the appellate authority is itself entitled to take
			<lb />
			into consideration something which the delinquent was prevented
			<lb />
			from putting forth before the authority which made the termination
			<lb />
			or dismissal order, it musts necessarily follow that the impinged
			<lb />
			order was before to be quashed merely on the ground that before
			<lb />
			the trial authority the person had been deprived of an opportunity
			<lb />
			to show cause. It is an established proposition that an appellate
			<lb />
			authority has normally the same powers as the original authority
			<lb />
			and if, in our view, a breach of any principle of natural justice can
			<lb />
			be remedied by the appellate jurisdiction, it will not be obligatory
			<lb />
			on the High Court to necessarily quash the order of the trial
			<lb />
			authority merely on the ground that there is a breach of natural
			<lb />
			justice. The question has been considered at some length in a Full
			<lb />
			Bench decision of this Court in Shantilal v. H. A. Rangaswami
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(1977) Mah. LJ 587, in which the Full Bench has taken the view
			<lb />
			that if there is any defect in the proceeding of the trial Tribunal
			<lb />
			arising out of violation of or non-compliance with any principle of
			<lb />
			natural justice and the appellate Tribunal is, under the appropriate
			<lb />
			rules, empowered to cure the defect, it will be difficult for the
			<lb />
			person concerned to contend that the order of the trial Tribunal
			<lb />
			should totally be ignored as a nullity on the ground that there is a
			<lb />
			breach of the principles of natural justice before the trial Tribunal.
			<lb />
			It has been held by the Full Bench that if a decision which, it is
			<lb />
			contended, is vitiated by violation of the principles of audi alteram
			<lb />
			partem could be subjected to scrutiny by the appellate Tribunal, it
			<lb />
			cannot be equated with a void decision as a decision without
			<lb />
			jurisdiction is.

			<lb />
			In Kanwar Natwar Singh vs. Director of Enforcement and
			<lb />
			Ors. (supra), the Supreme Court considered whether a noticee served
			<lb />
			with show cause notice under Rule 4(1) of the Foreign Exchange
			<lb />
			Management (Adjudication Proceedings and Appeal) Rules, 2000 is
			<lb />
			entitled to demand all the documents in possession of the Adjudicating
			<lb />
			Authority including those documents upon which no reliance has been
			<lb />
			placed to issue a notice requiring him to show cause why an inquiry
			<lb />
			should not be held against him. The Supreme Court held that the
			<lb />
			appellant is not entitled to documents which are not relied upon by the
			<lb />
			Adjudicating Authority. Referring to the decision in Lloyds vs.
			<lb />
			McMahon (supra) it was observed as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;20.
			<lb />
			In Lloyd vs. McMahon (1987) AC 625, Lord Bridge
			<lb />
			observed:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&apos;My Lords, the so called rules of natural justice are not engraved
			<lb />
			on tablets of stone. To use the phrase which better expresses the
			<lb />
			underlying concept, what the requirements of fairness demand
			<lb />
			when any body, domestic, administrative or judicial, has to
			<lb />
			make a decision which will affect the rights of individuals
			<lb />
			depends on the character of the decision-making body, the kind
			<lb />
			of decision it has to make and the statutory or other framework
			<lb />
			in which it operates. In particular, it is well-established that
			<lb />
			when a statute has conferred on any body the power to make
			<lb />
			decisions affecting individuals, the courts will not only require
			<lb />
			the procedure prescribed by the statute to be followed, but will
			<lb />
			readily imply so much and no more to be introduced by way of
			<lb />
			additional procedural safeguards as will ensure attainment of
			<lb />
			fairness.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			21. As Lord Reid said in Wiseman vs. Boardman (1971) AC 297:
			<lb />
			For a long time the courts have, without objection
			<lb />
			from Parliament, supplemented procedure laid down in
			<lb />
			legislation where they have found that to be necessary for this
			<lb />
			purpose....
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			22. It is thus clear that the extent of applicability of principles of
			<lb />
			natural justice depends upon the nature of inquiry, the
			<lb />
			consequences that may visit a person after such inquiry from
			<lb />
			out of the decision pursuant to such inquiry.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			252.
			<lb />
			The decision of the Supreme Court in L.K.Ratna (supra)
			<lb />
			was also distinguished by the Supreme Court in &quot;The United Planters
			<lb />
			Association of Southern India Vs. K.G.Sangameswaran &amp; Anr. 72 wherein
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court held that the decision in L.K.Ratna (supra) would
			<lb />
			not strictly apply in cases where the appellate authority can come to its
			<lb />
			own conclusion de&apos; hors the findings rendered by the first authority.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			253.
			<lb />
			Adverting to the above clear position in law, it needs to be
			<lb />
			observed that there cannot be an abstract proposition that a fair appeal
			<lb />
			cannot cure an unfair trial. This would certainly depend upon in the
			<lb />
			facts and circumstances of each case. In the present case, it is quite
			<lb />
			clear that AGRC has given sufficient opportunity to the parties
			<lb />
			including the petitioner, to urge all their pleas and assert their
			<lb />
			contentions, not only in respect to the documents but on all other
			<lb />
			issues. The AGRC considering these pleas as also matters which were
			<lb />
			not argued before the CEO SRA, has rendered its findings on all the
			<lb />
			issues. The petitioner having urged fresh/new pleas before the AGRC,
			<lb />
			72 (1997)4 SCC 741
			<lb />
			which were not urged before the CEO-SRA cannot blow hot and cold in
			<lb />
			the same breath.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			254.
			<lb />
			In any case as now the requirement of law would not be
			<lb />
			mere assertion that there is breach of principles of natural justice but
			<lb />
			what is required to be satisfied is that the breach of the principles of
			<lb />
			natural justice has caused prejudice to the complaining party. If the
			<lb />
			petitioner is not in a position to show any prejudice, the mere
			<lb />
			argument of breach of the principles of natural justice cannot be
			<lb />
			sustained. It can certainly observed that no prejudice was either
			<lb />
			pleaded or caused to the petitioner as sufficient opportunity was
			<lb />
			granted to the petitioner by AGRC. In this context the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			in Aligarh Muslim University &amp; Ors. vs. Mansoor Ali Khan (supra) has
			<lb />
			held that mere lacking of opportunity to be heard, would not be
			<lb />
			sufficient and the same must be coupled with the prejudice. The
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in paragraph 21, 24, 25 has observed thus:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			21.
			<lb />
			As pointed recently in M.C. Mehta Vs. Union of India (1999 (6)
			<lb />
			SCC 237), there can be certain situations in which an order passed in
			<lb />
			violation of natural justice need not be set aside under Article 226 of
			<lb />
			the Constitution of India. For example where no prejudice is caused to
			<lb />
			the person concerned, interference under Article 226 is not necessary.
			<lb />
			[…]
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			[…]
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			24.
			<lb />
			The principle that in addition to breach of natural justice,
			<lb />
			prejudice must also be proved has been developed in several cases. In
			<lb />
			K.L. Tripathi Vs. State Bank of India ( 1984(1) SCC 43), Sabyasachi
			<lb />
			Mukherji, J. ( as he then was) also laid down the principle that not
			<lb />
			mere violation of natural justice but de facto prejudice (other than
			<lb />
			non-issue of notice) had to be proved. It was observed: quoting Wade
			<lb />
			Administrative Law, (5th Ed.PP.472-475) as follows: ( SCC p. 58 para
			<lb />
			31)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;....it is not possible to lay down rigid rules as to when
			<lb />
			principles of natural justice are to apply, nor as their
			<lb />
			scope and extent ....There must have been some real
			<lb />
			prejudice to the complainant; there is no such thing as a
			<lb />
			merely technical infringement of natural justice. The
			<lb />
			requirements of natural justice must depend on the facts
			<lb />
			and circumstances of the case, the nature of the inquiry,
			<lb />
			the rules under which the tribunal is acting, the subject
			<lb />
			matter to be dealt with and so forth&quot;.
			<lb />
			Since then, this Court has consistently applied the principle of
			<lb />
			prejudice in several cases. The above ruling and various other rulings
			<lb />
			taking the same view have been exhaustively referred to in State Bank
			<lb />
			of Patiala Vs. S.K. Sharma ( 1996(3) SCC 364). In that case, the
			<lb />
			principle of &apos;prejudice&apos; has been further elaborated. The same principle
			<lb />
			has been reiterated again in Rajendra Singh Vs. State of M.P. ( 1996(5)
			<lb />
			SCC 460).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			25.
			<lb />
			The &apos;useless formality&apos; theory, it must be noted, is an exception.
			<lb />
			Apart from the class of cases of &quot;admitted or indisputable facts leading
			<lb />
			only to one conclusion&quot; referred to above,-there has been considerable
			<lb />
			debate of the application of that theory in other cases. The divergent
			<lb />
			views expressed in regard to this theory have been elaborately
			<lb />
			considered by this Court in M.C. Mehta referred to above. This Court
			<lb />
			surveyed the views expressed in various judgments in England by Lord
			<lb />
			Reid, Lord Wilberforce, Lord Woolf, Lord Bingham, Megarry, J. and
			<lb />
			Straughton L.J. etc. in various cases and also views expressed by
			<lb />
			leading writers like Profs. Garner, Craig, De. Smith, Wade, D.H. Clark
			<lb />
			etc. Some of them have said that orders passed in violation must
			<lb />
			always be quashed for otherwise the Court will be prejudging the
			<lb />
			issue. Some others have said, that there is no such absolute rule and
			<lb />
			prejudice must be shown. Yet, some others have applied via-media
			<lb />
			rules. We do not think it necessary, in this case to go deeper into these
			<lb />
			issues. In the ultimate analysis, it may depend on the facts of a
			<lb />
			particular case.
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			255.
			<lb />
			Also in Canara Bank vs. Debasis Das, (2003) 4 SCC 557,
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court reiterated the test of prejudice observing as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			10.
			<lb />
			It is to be further noted that in the appeal before the Appellate
			<lb />
			Authority findings of the Inquiry Officer were challenged and,
			<lb />
			therefore, the question of any prejudice does not arise. Since employee
			<lb />
			had the opportunity to meet the stand of the Bank, it was to his
			<lb />
			advantage, and opportunity for personal hearing was also granted,
			<lb />
			though Regulation 6(18) does not even speak to grant such an
			<lb />
			opportunity. Keeping in view what was observed in B. Karunakara&apos;s
			<lb />
			case (supra) there was no question of violation of principles of natural
			<lb />
			justice.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			27.
			<lb />
			It is to be noted that at no stage the employee pleaded
			<lb />
			prejudice. Both Learned Single Judge and the Division Bench
			<lb />
			proceeded on the basis that there was no compliance of the
			<lb />
			requirement of Regulation 6(18) and, therefore, prejudice was caused.
			<lb />
			In view of the finding recorded supra that Regulation 6(18) has not
			<lb />
			been correctly interpreted, the conclusions regarding prejudice are
			<lb />
			indefensible.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			256.
			<lb />
			Adverting to the above principles of law, it needs to be
			<lb />
			stated and as noted above, there is no material whatsoever either in the
			<lb />
			pleadings or otherwise that the petitioner has suffered any prejudice on
			<lb />
			account of the CEO SRA considering the said General Body Resolution
			<lb />
			of May 2014, the facts in this context are discussed in extenso in the
			<lb />
			foregoing paragraphs which clearly show that the petitioner would not
			<lb />
			have succeeded in the plea of respondent no.5 not being supported by
			<lb />
			70% of the slum dwellers qua the composite scheme in making the
			<lb />
			proposal and/or revised proposal to the SRA.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			257.
			<lb />
			In the above circumstances, I do not find that there is any
			<lb />
			merit in the contentions as urged on behalf of the petitioner, on the
			<lb />
			issue of breach of principles of natural justice. Consequently I do not
			<lb />
			find that the order of the CEO-SRA on the petitioner&apos;s application
			<lb />
			under Section 13(2) as confirmed by the AGRC are in any manner
			<lb />
			vitiated by illegality.
			<lb />
			Interference under Article 226 of the Constitution :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			258.
			<lb />
			The respondent would be correct in contending that
			<lb />
			exercise of powers by the Writ Court in the SRA matters must be
			<lb />
			limited to the matters which remain unresolved despite the remedy of
			<lb />
			an appeal being exhausted more particularly when the full fledged
			<lb />
			hearing complying the principles of natural justice was granted before
			<lb />
			AGRC on all the issues. The Full Bench of this Court in Tulsiwadi
			<lb />

			Maharashtra and Ors. (supra) in this context observed as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			115. In the result, we are of the opinion that writ jurisdiction is
			<lb />
			available in matters of Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers but the limits of
			<lb />
			exercise of power should be confined and restricted to matters, which
			<lb />
			remain unresolved despite the remedies of Appeals etc. being
			<lb />
			exhausted. Similarly, in the illustrations given by learned Advocate
			<lb />
			General, this Court can be approached only if the decision of SRA or
			<lb />
			State is permissible for being interfered with on the settled principles
			<lb />
			in writ jurisdiction. We have given illustrations and categories of case
			<lb />
			wherein a prerogative writ may be issued so as to ensure smooth and
			<lb />
			effective implementation of Slum Rehabilitation Scheme. However, the
			<lb />
			writ jurisdiction will not be available where the dispute is essentially
			<lb />
			private or contractual and the State Government, SRA and other local
			<lb />
			bodies are impleaded as parties only to file writ petition. In other
			<lb />
			words, when the main relief is not sought against these bodies, yet,
			<lb />
			they have been impleaded as parties and the dispute is mainly and
			<lb />
			essentially between private parties involving purely private law, then,
			<lb />
			writ petition is not the remedy.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			116. […] They broadly agree with the conclusion that the intent of the
			<lb />
			Legislature is minimum obstacles and obstructions in the way of
			<lb />
			implementation of Slum Rehabilitation Scheme. All provisions and
			<lb />
			measures are intended at smooth and expeditious implementation of
			<lb />
			the scheme so as to achieve removal of encroachment and demolition
			<lb />
			of structures on pavements and public lands. Therefore, interference
			<lb />
			by the Court should be minimum and bearing in mind the above
			<lb />
			intent.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
			Applying the above principles it can be clearly seen from
			<lb />
			the facts, there is hardly any scope for this Court to exercise its
			<lb />
			extraordinary discretionary jurisdiction to interfere in the findings of
			<lb />
			fact concurrently recorded by the authorities below. Respondent nos. 2
			<lb />
			to 4, 5, 8 and 9 would be correct in their contentions that this is not a
			<lb />
			case where the High Court should exercise jurisdiction to disturb the
			<lb />
			concrete findings of fact as arrived by both the authorities in the
			<lb />
			impugned orders. The law in this regard being well settled can also be
			<lb />
			seen from the following decisions:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			259.
			<lb />
			In Union of India &amp; Anr. vs. Mustafa &amp; Najibai Trading
			<lb />
			Co. 73 , the Supreme Court has reiterated the principles the High Court
			<lb />
			would follow in exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 and 227 of
			<lb />
			73 1998 SCC 79
			<lb />
			the Constitution. In paragraph 21 the Supreme Court observed thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;21.
			<lb />
			While exercising its jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of
			<lb />
			the Constitution it is not open to the High Court to re-appreciate the
			<lb />
			evidence produced before the subordinate tribunal and on the basis of
			<lb />
			such re-appreciation of the evidence to arrive at a finding different from
			<lb />
			that recorded by such tribunal. The finding of fact recorded by the
			<lb />
			subordinate tribunal can be interfered with by the High Court only if it is
			<lb />
			found to be based on no evidence or if such a finding can be regarded as
			<lb />
			perverse. The high Court cannot convert itself into a court of appeal.
			<lb />
			Reference, in this context, may be made to the decision of this Court in
			<lb />
			Collector of Customs, Madras &amp; Ors. v. D. Bhoormall, 1974 (2) SCC 544,
			<lb />
			wherein it has been said:-
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			37.
			<lb />
			Even if the Division Bench of the High Court felt that
			<lb />
			this circumstantial evidence was not adequate enough to establish
			<lb />
			the smuggled character of the goods, beyond doubt, then also, in
			<lb />
			our opinion that was not a good ground to justify interference
			<lb />
			with the Collector&apos;s order in the exercise of the writ jurisdiction
			<lb />
			under Article 226 of the Constitution. The function of weighing
			<lb />
			the evidence or considering its sufficiency was the business of the
			<lb />
			Collector or the appellate authority which was the final tribunal of
			<lb />
			fact. &quot;For weighing evidence and drawing interference from it&quot;,
			<lb />
			said Birch, J. in R. V. Madhub Chunder &quot;there can be canon. Each
			<lb />
			case presents its own peculiarities and in each common sense and
			<lb />
			shrewdness must be brought to bear upon the facts elicited&quot;. It
			<lb />
			follows from this observation that so long as the Collector&apos;s
			<lb />
			appreciation of the circumstantial evidence before him was not
			<lb />
			illegal, perverse or devoid of common sense, or contrary to rules
			<lb />
			of natural justice, there would be no warrant for disturbing his
			<lb />
			finding under Article 226.&quot;
			<lb />
			Similarly, in Indru Ramchand Bharvani &amp; Ors. v. Union or India &amp; Ors.,
			<lb />
			1988 (4) SCC 1, this Court has said:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It must be reiterated that the conclusions arrived at by the fact-
			<lb />
			finding bodies, the Tribunal or the statutory authorities, on the
			<lb />
			facts, found that cumulative effect or preponderance of evidence
			<lb />
			cannot be interfered with where the fact-finding body or
			<lb />
			authority has acted reasonably upon the view which can be taken
			<lb />
			by any reasonable man, courts will be reluctant to interfere in
			<lb />
			such a situation. Where, however, the conclusions of the fact-
			<lb />
			finding authority are based on no evidence then the question of
			<lb />
			law arises and that may be looked into by the courts but in the
			<lb />
			instant case the facts are entirely different.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			260.
			<lb />
			In Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. vs. Bhurumal 74 , the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court held that only when the findings are perverse or when it is a case
			<lb />
			of no evidence the Court can interfere. In paragraph 20 the Court
			<lb />
			observed thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;20.
			<lb />
			It is apparent that the aforesaid findings are findings of fact.
			<lb />
			Such findings are not to be interfered with by the High Court under
			<lb />
			Article 226 of the Constitution or by this Court under Article 136 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. Interference is permissible only in case these findings are
			<lb />
			totally perverse or based on no evidence. Insufficiency of evidence
			<lb />
			cannot be a ground to interdict these findings as it is not the function of
			<lb />
			this court to reappreciate the evidence. It was because of this reason
			<lb />
			that learned counsel for the appellant made frontal attack on the
			<lb />
			findings of the courts below endeavoured to demonstrate that there
			<lb />
			was perversity in the fact finding by the CGIT which was glossed over
			<lb />
			by the High Court as well.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			261.
			<lb />
			The project being a composite project would have its
			<lb />
			peculiarity. In this context, it would be necessary to refer the decision
			<lb />
			of the Division Bench of this Court in Sajid Abdul Sattar Urankar &amp; Ors.
			<lb />
			vs. State of Maharashtra &amp; Ors. 75 (supra). In paragraph 5, considering
			<lb />
			that the project was a composite project, the Court made the following
			<lb />
			observations:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;5.
			<lb />
			In the present case, the properties comprised in CS 1101 and CS
			<lb />
			1102 are being redeveloped under DCR 33(7) as part of a composite
			<lb />
			project. Amalgamation of the two plots has been sanctioned. Since the
			<lb />
			project is being treated as a composite project of redevelopment, the
			<lb />
			total number of occupants involved is 105, comprised of 88 occupants
			<lb />
			of CS 1102 and 17 occupants of CS 1101. None of the occupants of CS
			<lb />
			1102 has made any complaint and, as a matter of fact, all of them have
			<lb />
			shifted out of their erstwhile tenements so as to facilitate the process of
			<lb />
			redevelopment. Similarly, 7 of the 17 occupants of CS 1101 have also
			<lb />
			shifted out. Therefore, even if all the 10 Petitioners were to be treated
			<lb />
			as persons who have not consented to the scheme for redevelopment
			<lb />
			that would not make any difference to the computation of the figure of
			<lb />
			74 7 SCC 177
			<lb />
			75 2011 (5) Mh. L.J. 131
			<lb />
			seventy percent. Besides, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the
			<lb />
			developer points out that not all the 10 Petitioners were eligible
			<lb />
			occupants. In a judgment of a Single Judge of this Court (Smt. Ranjana
			<lb />
			Desai,J.) in Fathima Michael Pillai vs. Rajendra Rameshchandra
			<lb />
			Chaturvedi &amp; anr., 1998 (6) LJ 1001 the Court held that where three
			<lb />
			plots had been amalgamated the consent of seventy percent of all the
			<lb />
			tenants put together would have to be taken into consideration in order
			<lb />
			to satisfy the requirement of Section 95A(2) of the MHADA Act, 1976.
			<lb />
			Counsel for the Petitioners submits that for the purpose of DCR 33(7)
			<lb />
			each building must be considered separately and the consents of
			<lb />
			seventy percent of the occupants of every building must be taken
			<lb />
			separately. The submission cannot be accepted. Once there is an
			<lb />
			amalgamation of two properties, as in this case, a composite scheme of
			<lb />
			redevelopment is envisaged. Seventy percent of the tenants/occupants
			<lb />
			taken in the scheme as a whole must indicate their consents. The
			<lb />
			scheme is to enure to the benefit of the entire body of them. To require
			<lb />
			consents to be obtained individually for each building in a composite
			<lb />
			scheme will defeat the purpose of the scheme, besides being tardy. This
			<lb />
			will virtually amount to a veto being conferred on a small group of
			<lb />
			occupants to obstruct the scheme though the large body of them in
			<lb />
			excess of seventy percent has agreed. The island city of Mumbai has
			<lb />
			numerous congested areas where it is desirable in the interests of urban
			<lb />
			planning to execute composite redevelopment of adjoining properties.
			<lb />
			Where this is sought to be achieved, the requirement of seventy percent
			<lb />
			must apply to the occupants taken as a whole.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			262.
			<lb />
			It needs to be stated that this is certainly not a case and
			<lb />
			more particularly when a composite scheme of such peculiar nature
			<lb />
			was being implemented by respondent no.5, that a new developer
			<lb />
			ought to be permitted to take over one part of the scheme namely
			<lb />
			slums portion of the petitioner-Society. This would amount to defeating
			<lb />
			the scheme as originally proposed on behalf of the three societies, and
			<lb />
			being implemented by respondent no.5. The relief if granted would
			<lb />
			cause a serious prejudice to a large group of slums dwellers and that
			<lb />
			too who are occupying the Government land and who have now
			<lb />
			vacated their structures and are residing in the transit accommodation,
			<lb />
			awaiting a permanent abode. In these circumstances a test of &quot;due
			<lb />
			consideration&quot; to all the factors, which would unsettle the scheme
			<lb />
			would be required to be applied. The Court cannot adopt an approach
			<lb />
			that the consolidated scheme as submitted would stand extinguished,
			<lb />
			creating further serious complications. This Court would thus be loath
			<lb />
			to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction in the absence of any patent
			<lb />
			illegality touching the slum rehabilitation scheme and would not lightly
			<lb />
			interfere in the findings recorded by the authorities who have taken a
			<lb />
			plausible view of the matter on all counts. The substantial steps so far
			<lb />
			taken on the scheme also cannot be overlooked.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			263.
			<lb />
			In Vasant Kheraj Bhanushali &amp; Ors. (supra), the Division
			<lb />
			Bench held that the actual progress of a slum scheme becomes relevant.
			<lb />
			The Court observed as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;12. For all these reasons we are of the view that there is no merit in the
			<lb />
			submissions. There is also substance in the contention urged on behalf
			<lb />
			of the society and the developer that there has been a delay in
			<lb />
			instituting these proceedings under Article 226. The work of
			<lb />
			development has already progressed. Out of the 672 occupants, the
			<lb />
			present developer claims to have the consents of 571 occupants.
			<lb />
			Documents have been registered with 472 of the occupants. The
			<lb />
			structures of 412 occupants have already been demolished and they
			<lb />
			have either shifted to transit accommodation or are in receipt of
			<lb />
			payment in lieu thereof. The construction work is already in progress. In
			<lb />
			this view of the matter, it would be manifestly against the interest of the
			<lb />
			occupants whose structures have been demolished and who are now
			<lb />
			awaiting the completion of the scheme, for this Court to intervene in
			<lb />
			exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 226. However, we have also
			<lb />
			considered the merits of the contentions and have found that there is no
			<lb />
			substance in the grievances of the Petitioners.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			264.
			<lb />
			In my opinion, what would weigh with the Court is the
			<lb />
			larger public benefit. The facts and circumstances would indicate that
			<lb />
			such fragmenting of the scheme would result in an irreparable injury
			<lb />
			not only to the slum dwellers but also to respondent no.5 who has
			<lb />
			already invested substantial time, energy and money and who is to now
			<lb />
			to commence construction of the rehabilitation buildings. During the
			<lb />
			pendency of the proceedings before AGRC, about 644 structures of the
			<lb />
			slum-dwellers are already demolished which includes 205 structures in
			<lb />
			the petitioner society. Respondent no.5 has also parted large amounts
			<lb />
			which include payment of the interim rent to the slum dwellers for
			<lb />
			temporary alternate accommodation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			265.
			<lb />
			It also needs to be emphasized that the requirement of
			<lb />
			70% of the slum dwellers agreeing for redevelopment of slum by
			<lb />
			appointing a developer and thereafter the developer taking substantial
			<lb />
			steps to forward the scheme by changing his position, cannot be
			<lb />
			overlooked. It cannot be accepted that the scheme taken as a whole,
			<lb />
			the minority slum dwellers can render nugatory the initial will of the
			<lb />
			majority (70%) of the slum dwellers and more particularly when the
			<lb />
			scheme has progressed as in the present case, and the absence of any
			<lb />
			illegalities.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			266.
			<lb />
			There are number of decisions which were cited on behalf
			<lb />
			of the parties. I have referred to the relevant decisions which were
			<lb />
			sufficient, in my opinion, to address the issues. No doubt the decisions
			<lb />
			which are cited lay down certain proposition of law which are well
			<lb />
			established and with which there cannot be any disagreement.
			<lb />
			However, for the purposes of this case, they are wholly academic,
			<lb />
			requiring no further discussion.
			<lb />
			CONCLUSION
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			267.
			<lb />
			As a sequel to the above discussion I am clearly of the
			<lb />
			opinion that there is no illegality in the findings recorded in the
			<lb />
			impugned orders passed by the CEO SRA and AGRC. Both the petitions
			<lb />
			fail. They are accordingly rejected. No costs.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			268.
			<lb />
			The SRA is directed to take steps to recover all the
			<lb />
			amounts including penalty, if any, from respondent no.5 strictly as per
			<lb />
			the &quot;SRA Office Order No.19 of 2015 dated 23 March 2015&quot; which
			<lb />
			shall be done within a period of two months from today. Considering
			<lb />
			the interest of the slum dwellers who are awaiting rehabilitation,
			<lb />
			respondent no.5 is directed to commence construction of the
			<lb />
			rehabilitation buildings as expeditiously as possible and complete the
			<lb />
			construction within a period of two years from the land being vacated
			<lb />
			by the remaining slum dwellers. The authorities are directed to do all
			<lb />
			the needful to enable respondent no.5 to commence construction.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			269.
			<lb />
			PARTING NOTE
			<lb />
			As there has been some delay, in pronouncing this
			<lb />
			judgment, I am reminded of the insightful words of Krishna Iyer, J. in
			<lb />
			&quot;L.I.C. Vs. D.J.Bahadur &amp; Ors.&quot; 76 His Lordship speaking for the Bench
			<lb />
			offered &quot;A Word of Explanation&quot;. I would be failing in my duty if I do
			<lb />
			not refer to the observations, which read as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Krishna Iyer, J.
			<lb />
			A Word of Explanation
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			1.
			<lb />
			A preliminary divagation has become necessary since
			<lb />
			applications and enquiries had been made more than once
			<lb />
			about the postponement of the judgment.
			<lb />
			The first
			<lb />
			anniversary of the closure of oral submissions in the above
			<lb />
			case is just over; and this unusual delay between argument
			<lb />
			and judgment calls from me, the presiding judge of the
			<lb />
			bench which heard the case, a word of explanation and
			<lb />
			clarification so that misunderstanding about the judges may
			<lb />
			melt away in the light. A better appreciation of this court&apos;s
			<lb />
			functional adversities and lack of research facilities will
			<lb />
			promote more compassion than criticism and in that hope I
			<lb />
			add this note.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			2.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			judicature,
			<lb />
			like
			<lb />
			other
			<lb />
			constitutional
			<lb />
			instrumentalities, has a culture of national accountability.
			<lb />
			Two factors must be highlighted in this context. A court is
			<lb />
			more than a Judge; a collegium has a personality which
			<lb />
			exceeds its members. The price a collective process, free
			<lb />
			from personality cult, has to pay is long patience, free
			<lb />
			exchange and final decision in conformity with the
			<lb />
			democracy of judicial functionality. Sometimes, when
			<lb />
			divergent strands of thought haunt the mentations of the
			<lb />
			members, we pause, ponder and reconsider because we
			<lb />
			follow the words of Oliver Cromwell commended for courts
			<lb />
			by Judge Learned Hand: &quot;My brethren, I beseech you, in the
			<lb />
			bowels of Christ, think it possible that you may be mistaken.&quot;
			<lb />
			Utter incompatibility exists between judicial democracy and
			<lb />
			dogmatic infallibility; and so, in this case, we have taken
			<lb />
			time, more time and repeated extension of time to evolve a
			<lb />
			broad consensus out of our initial dissensus. Not
			<lb />
			procrastination but plural toil is the hidden truth behind the
			<lb />
			considerable interval.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			76 AIR 1980 SC 2181
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			3.
			<lb />
			Secondly, when important issues demand the court&apos;s
			<lb />
			collective judgment an informed meeting of instructed
			<lb />
			minds, in many ways, is a sine qua non. But the torrent of
			<lb />
			litigation flooding the court drowns the judges in the daily
			<lb />
			drudgery of accumulated dockets. To gain leisure for
			<lb />
			fundamental reflections with some respite from paper-logged
			<lb />
			existence and supportive research from trained law clerks is
			<lb />
			a &apos;consummation devoutly to be wished&apos; if the final court is
			<lb />
			to fulfil its tryst with the Constitution and country. The
			<lb />
			Indian judicial process, sui generis in some respects, has its
			<lb />
			problems, Himalayan in dimension but hardly appreciated in
			<lb />
			perspective and in true proportions two of which have been
			<lb />
			mentioned by me in extenuation of the great gap between
			<lb />
			closure for judgment and its actual pronouncement…..&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The above words are realized to be true in the judicial functioning even
			<lb />
			this day.
