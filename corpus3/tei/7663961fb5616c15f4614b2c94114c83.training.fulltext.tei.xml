			<lb />
			&quot;Sentencing justice is a facet of social justice, even as
			<lb />
			redemption of a crime-doer is an aspect of restoration of
			<lb />
			a whole personality. Till the new Code recognised
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 4
			<lb />
			statutorily that punishment required considerations
			<lb />
			beyond the nature of the crime and circumstances
			<lb />
			surrounding the crime and provided a second stage for
			<lb />
			bringing in such additional materials, the Indian Courts
			<lb />
			had, by and large, assigned an obsolescent backseat to
			<lb />
			the sophisticated judgment on sentencing. Now this
			<lb />
			judicial skill has to come of age.&quot;

			1.
			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav were convicted by a
			<lb />
			judgment dated 28 th May, 2008 passed by the learned Additional
			<lb />
			Sessions Judge for commission of offences under Section
			<lb />
			302/364/201 read with Section 34 IPC in SC Case No.78 of 2002
			<lb />
			arising out of FIR No.192/02. By an order dated 30 th May, 2008,
			<lb />
			they were sentenced to life imprisonment as well as fine of one
			<lb />
			lakh each under Sections 302 of the IPC and in default of payment
			<lb />
			of fine, to undergo simple imprisonment for one year. They were
			<lb />
			sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for ten years and fine of
			<lb />
			Rs.50,000/-each for their conviction under Section 364/34 IPC, in
			<lb />
			default to undergo simple imprisonment for six months and
			<lb />
			rigorous imprisonment for five years and fine of Rs.10,000/-each

			<lb />
			three months. All sentences were to run concurrently.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			2.
			<lb />
			By an order dated 6 th of July 2011 in SC No.76 of 2008,
			<lb />
			Sukhdev Yadav @ Pehalwan was also found guilty for commission
			<lb />
			of the same offences under Sections 302/364/34 and Section 201 of
			<lb />
			the IPC. Consequently, by an order dated 12 th July, 2011, Sukhdev
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Yadav @ Pehalwan was sentenced to undergo life imprisonment

			3.
			<lb />
			The learned trial judges in the instant case, have not imposed
			<lb />
			the death sentence which was the maximum sentence prescribed
			<lb />
			for commission of the offence under Section 302 IPC. In the case
			<lb />
			of Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav, they have been sentenced to life
			<lb />
			imprisonment and fine of Rs.1,00,000/-has been imposed. In
			<lb />
			default of payment of fine, simple imprisonment of one year is
			<lb />
			stipulated. Sukhdev Yadav @ Pehalwan, though has been
			<lb />
			sentenced to life imprisonment, however fine of merely
			<lb />
			Rs.10,000/-has been imposed. Furthermore, in default of payment
			<lb />
			of fine, rigorous imprisonment for two years has been ordered.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			For commission of the offences under Section 364 IPC as
			<lb />
			well, the maximum sentence has not been imposed in both cases.
			<lb />
			By the order dated 30 th May, 2008, passed in the case of Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav and Vishal Yadav, they have not been given the maximum
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 6
			<lb />
			sentence of imprisonment of life but have been sentenced to
			<lb />
			imprisonment for a term of ten years and fine of Rs.50,000/-each.
			<lb />
			In default of payment, each of them is required to undergo simple
			<lb />
			imprisonment of six months. For commission of the same offence
			<lb />
			under Section 364 IPC, Sukhdev Yadav @ Pehalwan has been
			<lb />
			sentenced by the order dated 12 th July, 2011 to undergo rigorous
			<lb />
			imprisonment of merely seven years and fine of Rs.5,000/-. In
			<lb />
			default of payment of fine, Sukhdev Yadav is required to undergo
			<lb />
			six months rigorous imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			So far as the commission of the offence under Section 201 of
			<lb />
			the IPC is concerned, Vikas Yadav &amp; Vishal Yadav have been
			<lb />
			sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for five years and fine
			<lb />
			of Rs.10,000/-. In default, they are required to undergo three
			<lb />
			months simple imprisonment. For the same offence, Sukhdev
			<lb />
			Yadav has been sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment of
			<lb />
			only three years and fine of Rs.5,000/-. In default of payment, he
			<lb />
			is required to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			During the pendency of Crl.App.Nos.741/2008 and
			<lb />
			910/2008, assailing the convictions and sentences by Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
			and Vishal Yadav respectively, the State filed Crl.A.No.958/2008
			<lb />
			entitled State v. Vikas and Vishal Yadav under Section 377 of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. seeking enhancement of the sentence imposed on them by
			<lb />
			the learned Additional Sessions Judge by the order dated 30 th May,
			<lb />
			2008.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			Sukhdev Yadav filed Crl.App.No.145/2012 assailing his
			<lb />
			conviction and sentence. The State also filed Crl.A.No.1322/2011,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 7
			<lb />
			State v. Sukhdev Pehalwan seeking enhancement of the sentence
			<lb />
			imposed by the order dated 12 th July, 2011, pursuant to conviction.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			Additionally, the complainant -Nilam Katara (mother of
			<lb />
			deceased Nitish Katara) has also filed Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008
			<lb />
			praying for enhancement of the sentences on Vikas Yadav and
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav which has been directed to be heard along with the
			<lb />
			other cases.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			In view of the pendency of the appeals before the Division
			<lb />
			Bench, the Registrar (Judicial) directed that the revision petition be
			<lb />
			heard along with the appeals which was also consequently placed
			<lb />
			before us. The appeals filed by the prisoners as well as the State
			<lb />
			appeal and the complainant&apos;s revision were all being taken up
			<lb />
			together. Inasmuch the appeals against the orders dated 28 th May,
			<lb />
			2008 and 6 th July, 2011 were pending, it was directed on 24 th May,
			<lb />
			2013 that the State appeal and the criminal revision be listed after
			<lb />
			the pronouncement of the judgment on the appeals against the
			<lb />
			conviction.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			10. Thus Vikas Yadav, Vishal Yadav and Sukhdev Yadav are
			<lb />
			appellants in Crl.App.Nos. 910/2008, 741/2008 and 145/2012 and
			<lb />
			are respondents in Crl.App.Nos.958/2008 and 1322/2011 and
			<lb />
			Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008. We propose to refer to the convict persons
			<lb />
			as defendants in this judgment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			11. It is noteworthy that in the two State appeals as well as the
			<lb />
			revision petition filed by the complainant, the prayer is for
			<lb />
			enhancement of the sentence of life imprisonment handed out to
			<lb />
			imposition of the death penalty on the defendants.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 8
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			12. This court has upheld the conviction of Vikas Yadav, Vishal
			<lb />
			Yadav and Sukhdev Yadav by the common judgment dated 2 nd
			<lb />
			April, 2014 whereby the two appeals of Vikas Yadav and Vishal
			<lb />
			Yadav assailing their conviction by the judgment dated 28 th May,
			<lb />
			2008 as well as the third appeal of Sukhdev Yadav assailing his
			<lb />
			conviction by the judgment dated 6 th July, 2011 in the two cases
			<lb />
			arising out of FIR No.192/02 registered by P.S. Kavi Nagar,
			<lb />
			Ghaziabad were dismissed. It is noteworthy that protracted
			<lb />
			arguments were heard on the legality and validity of these two
			<lb />
			judgments alone and judgment was reserved thereon which was
			<lb />
			pronounced on 2 nd April, 2014.
			<lb />
			As such the question of the validity of the orders on sentence
			<lb />
			which came to be imposed by the order dated 30 th May, 2008 (in
			<lb />
			the case of Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav) and 12 th July, 2011 (in
			<lb />
			the case of Sukhdev Pehalwan) was kept aside in their appeals for
			<lb />
			consideration by this court with the State appeals.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			13. So far as Crl.App.No.1322/2011 is concerned, seeking
			<lb />
			enhancement of the sentence imposed on Sukhdev Yadav @
			<lb />
			Pehalwan, on the 22 nd of March 2012, on a statement by his
			<lb />
			counsel that they contest the appeal on merits and do not oppose
			<lb />
			the application by the State seeking condonation of delay, the delay
			<lb />
			was condoned and the appeal was admitted for hearing. Sukhdev
			<lb />
			Yadav @ Pehalwan has been represented on all dates by counsel
			<lb />
			whose submissions in this appeal are noted hereafter. The appeal
			<lb />
			was listed on all dates with the other appeals and the criminal
			<lb />
			revision.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 9
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			14. On 16 th May, 2014, in Crl.A.Nos.958/2008 and 1322/2011,
			<lb />
			notice was issued by this court under Section 377(3) of the Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
			for enhancement of sentences. Opportunity has been afforded to
			<lb />
			the defendants to show cause. Notices stand accepted in court by
			<lb />
			counsel on behalf of the defendants. The defendants Vikas Yadav,
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav as well as Sukhdev Yadav have been duly
			<lb />
			represented by counsel who have appeared and opposed the
			<lb />
			enhancement on every date of hearing before this court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			15. In the proceedings on 16 th May, 2014, Mr. Sumeet Verma,
			<lb />
			learned counsel pointed out that formal notice had not been issued
			<lb />
			in Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008 which was being listed on all dates
			<lb />
			along with the above criminal appeals. Counsels had been
			<lb />
			appearing in this revision as well. However, on the 16 th May,
			<lb />
			2014, to avoid any kind of technical objection, formal notice was
			<lb />
			issued to the defendants -Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav to show
			<lb />
			cause against enhancement of the sentences which were imposed
			<lb />
			upon them by the learned Additional Judge by the order dated 30 th
			<lb />
			May, 2008 which were accepted by Mr. Sumeet Verma, Advocate
			<lb />
			and Mr. Sanjay Jain, Advocate respectively on their behalf.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			16. Vikas Yadav filed a response dated 23 rd May, 2014 to the
			<lb />
			notice to show cause for enhancement of sentence in
			<lb />
			Crl.App.No.958/2008. Additionally a brief synopsis dated 22 nd
			<lb />
			April, 2014 has been filed in Crl.App.No.958/2008 by Vishal
			<lb />
			Yadav while a similar synopsis has been filed on behalf of Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 10
			<lb />
			17. We have received nominal rolls in respect of all three
			<lb />
			prisoners. In addition thereto, voluminous written submissions and
			<lb />
			judicial precedents have been placed before us in support of their
			<lb />
			opposition.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			18. The above narration discloses that in two trials arising out of
			<lb />
			the same complaint, for commission of the same offences and
			<lb />
			convictions, based on identical evidence, two different sets of
			<lb />
			convicts have been differentially sentenced by the two learned
			<lb />
			Additional Sessions Judges before whom the trials proceeded to
			<lb />
			judgment. Even the default sentences are different. We propose to
			<lb />
			deal with the challenges on behalf of the defendants to the
			<lb />
			sentences handed out to them as well as the prayers made before us
			<lb />
			for enhancement of the sentences as well as the reasoning for the
			<lb />
			differential sentences for commission of the same offence by the
			<lb />
			two judges in the orders of sentences dated 30 th May, 2008 and 12 th
			<lb />
			July, 2011.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			19. The defendants before us do not dispute that they were given
			<lb />
			an opportunity of hearing in accordance with the provisions of
			<lb />
			Section 235(2) of the Cr.P.C. by the trial courts.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			20. On the issues under examination before us, extensive written
			<lb />
			submissions running into several volumes on the jurisdiction of this
			<lb />
			court to exercise any sentencing option as well as on the propriety
			<lb />
			of sentences, submissions on the factual merits of the prayers for
			<lb />
			enhancement of sentence as well as on award of compensation with
			<lb />
			judicial precedents and literature on each submission have been
			<lb />
			filed by Mr. Sumeet Verma, Advocate (for Vikas Yadav), Mr.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 11
			<lb />
			Sanjay Jain, Advocate (for Vishal Yadav), Mr. Rajesh Mahajan,
			<lb />
			Additional Standing Counsel (for the State) and Mr. P.K. Dey,
			<lb />
			learned counsel for the complainant.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			21. On the 17 th of November 2014, Mr. Chaman Sharma,
			<lb />
			learned counsel representing Sukhdev Yadav @ Pehalwan made a
			<lb />
			statement to the effect that he adopts the arguments on sentencing
			<lb />
			of Mr. Sumeet Verma and Mr. Sanjay Jain, learned counsels for
			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav respectively and that he had
			<lb />
			nothing to add to the same.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			22. During the pendency of the appeals, the attention of this
			<lb />
			court was brought by the Registry to the judgment of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court reported at (2013) 6 SCC 770, Ankush Shivaji Gaikwad v.
			<lb />
			State of Maharashtra wherein the Supreme Court had noted with
			<lb />
			anguish the failure of the courts to abide by the mandate of Section
			<lb />
			357 of the Cr.P.C. on the subject of compensation despite several
			<lb />
			judicial precedents.
			<lb />
			This is an important aspect of a criminal trial which is
			<lb />
			largely ignored by the courts or, if not, insufficiently applied.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			23. In the present case as well, while passing the judgments and
			<lb />
			sentences, the learned trial judges had failed to even refer to, let
			<lb />
			alone consider or exercise their jurisdiction under Section 357 of
			<lb />
			the Cr.P.C. It is also to be noted that neither in the criminal appeal
			<lb />
			by the State nor the criminal revision petition filed by the
			<lb />
			complainant, there is a specific prayer invoking Section 357 of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. seeking award of reasonable compensation under Section
			<lb />
			357 of the Cr.P.C. No specific prayer for enhancement of the fine
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 12
			<lb />
			which was imposed by the Sessions Court has been made. It
			<lb />
			therefore, became necessary for this court to consider what was
			<lb />
			permissible in order to comply with the statutory and judicial
			<lb />
			mandate. Was it permissible for this court as the appellate or
			<lb />
			revisional court to pass an order under Section 357 of the Cr.P.C.,
			<lb />
			given the failure of the trial courts to do so as well as in the
			<lb />
			absence of such a prayer by the State or the complainant?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			24. We may note that in the instant case, the defendants stand
			<lb />
			convicted for causing death of a young boy of 23 years. While
			<lb />
			considering the prayers for enhancement of sentence which
			<lb />
			includes &apos;fine&apos; as well as the appropriate order under Section 357 of
			<lb />
			the Cr.P.C., the question which would also require to be answered
			<lb />
			is as to whether he left any dependant(s) and whether any
			<lb />
			compensation is payable to his family members. It would also be
			<lb />
			necessary to ascertain the loss caused by the offence and the extent
			<lb />
			of compensation payable to them thereof.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			25. In the proceedings on 16 th May, 2014, we had found that the
			<lb />
			legislature had anticipated such eventuality as well and provided
			<lb />
			for the power of the appellate or the revisional court to do so. In
			<lb />
			this order it was observed as follows :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;11. It is also necessary to note the judicial
			<lb />
			pronouncements by one of us (J.R. Midha, J) dated 11th
			<lb />
			October, 2013 in Crl.Rev.Petition No.338 of 2009 Satya
			<lb />
			Prakash vs. State. This judgment (reported at 2013 (203)
			<lb />
			DLT 652) is premised on the above pronouncements by
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court. The entire conspectus of the law on
			<lb />
			Section 357 of the Cr.P.C., its contours, parameters and
			<lb />
			the necessary summary inquiry prescripted to be
			<lb />
			conducted by every criminal court while passing an
			<lb />
			order of conviction against the persons arrayed for trial
			<lb />
			or the High Court while upholding or finding a
			<lb />
			conviction in a criminal case, has been laid down.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			12. In the present case, it is not disputed that both the
			<lb />
			learned Additional Sessions Judges have failed to
			<lb />
			consider Section 357 of the Cr.P.C. or pass any orders
			<lb />
			thereunder. The statutory mandate, which stands re-
			<lb />
			enforced by repeated judicial pronouncements, is that
			<lb />
			this provision of law cannot be ignored and has to be
			<lb />
			mandatorily considered in every criminal case. In fact,
			<lb />
			the judicial pronouncements noted above of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court have mandated upon the criminal court
			<lb />
			that in case Section 357 Cr.P.C. is not invoked or
			<lb />
			applied, reasons must be given for not doing so.
			<lb />

		<item>
			20. Notice in Crl.Appeal Nos.958/2008 and 1322/2011
			<lb />
			was issued by this court under Section 377 of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. and an opportunity has been afforded to the
			<lb />
			respondents therein to show cause. Notices by counsel
			<lb />
			on behalf of the respondents stand accepted in court.
			<lb />
			The respondents have been duly represented by counsel.
			<lb />
			It is, hereby, clarified that the notices in the appeals
			<lb />
			were issued under Section 377 (3) for enhancement of
			<lb />
			the sentences, which were accepted on behalf of the
			<lb />
			respondents by their counsel who have appeared on
			<lb />
			every date of hearing before this court.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			21. It is pointed out by Mr.Sumeet Verma, learned
			<lb />
			counsel appearing for Mr.Vikas Yadav, respondent no.2
			<lb />
			that formal notice has not been issued in
			<lb />
			Crl.Rev.No.369/2008. We proceed to do so hereafter to
			<lb />
			avoid any technical objection.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			22. Notice is issued to the respondents to show cause
			<lb />
			against enhancement of the sentence which was
			<lb />
			imposed upon them by the learned Additional Sessions
			<lb />
			Judge by the order dated 30th May, 2008. Mr.Sumeet
			<lb />
			Verma, Advocate on behalf of Mr.Vikas Yadav and
			<lb />
			Mr.Sanjay Jain, Advocate on behalf of Mr.Vishal Yadav
			<lb />
			accept notice on behalf of the respondents.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />

			<lb />

			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Therefore while considering both appeals against the
			<lb />
			orders of sentence as well as appeals for enhancement of
			<lb />
			sentence, in addition to the prayers made therein for
			<lb />
			which notice to show cause stands issued, this court is
			<lb />
			adequately empowered to vary the sentence, or to make
			<lb />
			any consequential or incidental order as may be just and
			<lb />
			proper, provided that, if this court is making an order of
			<lb />
			enhancement of sentence, the same can be done only
			<lb />
			after the accused has had an opportunity of showing
			<lb />
			cause against such enhancement.&quot;
			<lb />

			26. Keeping in view the legislative mandate as well as the
			<lb />
			several directions of the Supreme Court of India noted above on
			<lb />
			the procedure to be followed by the court before passing an order
			<lb />
			under Section 357 of the CrPC, on the 16 th May 2014, we had
			<lb />
			issued the following directions:
			<lb />
			-28. Section 357 postulates that the whole or any part
			<lb />
			of the fine which is recovered, be applied inter alia for
			<lb />
			defraying the expenses properly incurred in the
			<lb />
			prosecution; and payment to any person for
			<lb />
			compensation for any loss or injury caused; when
			<lb />
			compensation is in the opinion of the court recoverable
			<lb />
			by such person in a civil court. How does the court
			<lb />
			compute the extent of the fine which must be imposed
			<lb />
			upon a convict or what would be just, reasonable and
			<lb />
			proper compensation or what was the expenses properly
			<lb />
			incurred for the prosecution? How does the court assess
			<lb />
			or compute the amount including extent of the loss
			<lb />
			caused to any person? Under Section 386 of the Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 15
			<lb />
			in a any matter of enhancement of sentence, the convict
			<lb />
			is entitled to reasonable opportunity of showing cause
			<lb />
			against the enhancement of sentence. For making an
			<lb />
			appropriate order under Section 357 of the Cr.P.C., it is
			<lb />
			necessary to ascertain the paying capacity of the
			<lb />
			convict; expenses incurred on the prosecution of the
			<lb />
			case; loss suffered because of the actions or omissions
			<lb />
			of the persons convicted.&quot;
			<lb />
			In view of the above, we directed as follows :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;(i) Notice is issued to Vikas Yadav, Vishal Yadav

			be served upon the three defendants who are in custody.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			28. On request of Shri S.S. Rathi, learned Additional Sessions
			<lb />
			Judge, who was appointed as inquiry officer on 27th May, 2014,
			<lb />
			time to complete the inquiry was extended by our order dated 27 th

		<p>
			29. We have heard learned counsels for the parties at length and

			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Statutory provisions and jurisprudence regarding
			<lb />
			imposition of the death penalty
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			32. In the administration of criminal justice, sentencing is as
			<lb />
			important a function to be discharged by the court as adjudication
			<lb />
			of culpability. Before considering the adequacy of the sentences
			<lb />
			imposed in the present cases, we may briefly notice the principles
			<lb />
			for sentencing. The sentences which the trial court may impose
			<lb />
			stand prescribed under the Indian Penal Code in the several
			<lb />
			provisions conferring discretion on the sentencing court with
			<lb />
			regard to the punishment which may be handed out to the convict.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 20
			<lb />
			33. So far as the conviction for the offence of murder is
			<lb />
			concerned, under Section 302 IPC, a sentence of death or
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life is prescribed. The statute also mandates that
			<lb />
			the convict -shall also be liable to fine‖.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			34. For commission of the offence of kidnapping or abducting in
			<lb />
			order to murder, Section 364 IPC prescribes that the convict shall
			<lb />
			be punished with imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment
			<lb />
			which may extend to 10 years and shall also be liable to fine.
			<lb />
			Section 34 of the IPC is concerned with acts done by several
			<lb />
			persons in furtherance of their common intention and mandates that
			<lb />
			the person, who is one of several persons who have committed a
			<lb />
			criminal act in furtherance of the common intention of all, is liable
			<lb />
			for that act in the same manner as if it was done by him alone.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			35. Section 201 of the IPC deals with causing disappearance of
			<lb />
			evidence of the offence or giving false information to screen an
			<lb />
			offender. If the convict is held guilty of causing evidence of
			<lb />
			commission of a capital offence to disappear with the intention of
			<lb />
			screening the offender for legal punishment, the statute prescribes
			<lb />
			that such convict shall be punished with imprisonment of either
			<lb />
			description for a term which may extend to seven years and shall
			<lb />
			also be liable to fine.
			<lb />
			If evidence of commission of an offence punishable with
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life or with imprisonment which may extend to
			<lb />
			ten years has been caused to disappear, the convict shall be
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 21
			<lb />
			punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which
			<lb />
			may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			36. It is also essential to consider the statutory requirements as
			<lb />
			well as the jurisprudence on the subject which has to guide our
			<lb />
			consideration. Section 367 (5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
			<lb />
			1898 (as it stood prior to the Amending Act of 26 of 1955)
			<lb />
			enjoined upon the trial court not inflicting upon a person guilty of a
			<lb />
			capital offence, to give reasons why imprisonment of life instead of
			<lb />
			the death sentence was being awarded. Thus, if a person was found
			<lb />
			guilty of murder, the sentence of death was the rule and the
			<lb />
			sentence of imprisonment for life was an exception. By the
			<lb />
			Amending Act 26 of 1955, Section 235(2) was incorporated while
			<lb />
			Section 367(5) of the Cr.P.C., 1898 was deleted from the law. As a
			<lb />
			result, discretion was conferred upon the trial court to impose
			<lb />
			either the death sentence or a sentence of life imprisonment upon
			<lb />
			conviction of a person for murder. The requirement of recording
			<lb />
			reasons for not imposing the death sentence was thus obviated.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			37. Another amendment of the Code of Criminal Procedure
			<lb />
			came into effect on the 1 st of April, 1974 (what came to be known
			<lb />
			as Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973) whereby Section 354(3) was
			<lb />
			incorporated into the law. After this amendment, the following
			<lb />
			statutory provision came to be added into the enactment:
			<lb />
			-354 (3) When the conviction is for an offence
			<lb />
			punishable with death or, in the alternative, with
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of
			<lb />
			years, the judgment shall state the reasons for the
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 22
			<lb />
			sentence awarded, and, in the case of sentence of death,
			<lb />
			the special reasons for such sentence.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			38. Thus, upon conviction for murder, imprisonment for life
			<lb />
			became a rule while death sentence was an exception. More
			<lb />
			importantly for imposing a death sentence, -special reasons had to
			<lb />
			be recorded‖.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			39. Before embarking on a factual analysis, it is necessary to
			<lb />
			briefly examine the jurisprudence on award of death penalty of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			40. Prior to the coming into force of Section 354(3) of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C., a question of lack of principled approach in imposing the
			<lb />
			death penalty was raised in (1973) 1 SCC 20, Jagmohan Singh v.
			<lb />
			The State of U.P. It was contended that there was excessive
			<lb />
			delegation of legislative function as the legislature had failed to lay
			<lb />
			down standards or policy to guide the judiciary in imposing its
			<lb />
			discretion. Rejecting this contention, the Supreme Court had held
			<lb />
			that :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The Penal Code provided a frame work which prescribes the
			<lb />
			maximum punishment and provides a wide discretion to the judge
			<lb />
			in deciding on the sentence for the individual offender.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii) It was impossible to lay down the standards which led to the
			<lb />
			conferment of the wide discretion.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii) An adequate safeguard with respect to the exercise of
			<lb />
			sentencing discretion existed as the Cr.P.C. provided the right to
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 23
			<lb />
			appeal and, therefore, if an error was committed by the court in
			<lb />
			exercise of the such discretion, the appellate court would correct
			<lb />
			the error.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv) The exercise of judicial discretion on -well recognized
			<lb />
			principles is in the final analysis, the safest possible safeguard for
			<lb />
			the accused&quot;. (Para -27)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			41. Another notable challenge to the death penalty was
			<lb />
			considered by the Supreme Court in the judgment reported at
			<lb />
			(1979) 3 SCC 646, Rajendra Prasad v. State of Uttar Pradesh.
			<lb />
			Writing for the Bench, Justice Krishna Iyer in para 7 cautioned that
			<lb />
			-Guided missiles, with lethal potential, in unguided hands, even
			<lb />
			judicial, is a grave risk where peril is mortal though tempered by
			<lb />
			the appellate process‖.
			<lb />
			The court was of the view that the meaning of -well
			<lb />
			recognized principles&quot; as articulated in Jagmohan Singh was
			<lb />
			unclear. In para 15, the Supreme Court noted that unless principles
			<lb />
			are expressly articulated, judicial discretion in sentencing is
			<lb />
			‗dangerous&apos;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			42. The two considerations by the Supreme Court in Jagmohan
			<lb />
			Singh and Rajendra Prasad provided the framework for the
			<lb />
			change in law and the amendments to the Cr.P.C. (known as the
			<lb />
			Criminal Procedure Code, 1973) noted by us.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			43. In the judgment of the Constitution Bench in (1980) 2 SCC
			<lb />
			684, Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, the challenge to the
			<lb />
			constitutionality of the death penalty was rejected. The court held
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 24
			<lb />
			that sentencing discretion in the context of the death penalty is not
			<lb />
			unguided. The court expanded the meaning of the expression
			<lb />
			‗well recognized principles&apos; (noted in Jagmohan Singh) to mean
			<lb />
			‗aggravated and mitigating circumstances&quot; identified by the court
			<lb />
			in its previous decisions. The court recast the propositions (iv)(a)
			<lb />
			and (v)(b) in Jagmohan stating thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;164. xxx xxx xxx
			<lb />
			-(a) The normal rule is that the offence of murder
			<lb />
			shall be punished with the sentence of life
			<lb />
			imprisonment. The court can depart from that rule
			<lb />
			and impose the sentence of death only if there are
			<lb />
			special reasons for doing so. Such reasons must
			<lb />
			be recorded in writing before imposing the death
			<lb />
			sentence.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(b) While considering the question of sentence to
			<lb />
			be imposed for the offence of murder under
			<lb />
			Section 302 of the Penal Code, the court must
			<lb />
			have regard to every relevant circumstance
			<lb />
			relating to the crime as well as the criminal. If the
			<lb />
			court finds, but not otherwise, that the offence is
			<lb />
			of an exceptionally depraved and heinous
			<lb />
			character and constitutes, on account of its design
			<lb />
			and the manner of its execution, a source of grave
			<lb />
			danger to the society at large, the court may
			<lb />
			impose the death sentence.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			44. In Bachan Singh, the court observed that by virtue of
			<lb />
			Section 354(3), the courts were required to provide ‗special
			<lb />
			reasons&apos; for imposing the death penalty and that through the
			<lb />
			enactment of Section 235(2) and 345(3), the legislature had laid the
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted
			<lb />
			except in gravest cases of extreme culpability;
			<lb />
			(ii) Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances
			<lb />
			of the ‗offender&apos; also require to be taken into consideration
			<lb />
			along with the circumstances of the ‗crime&apos;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			45. Disagreeing with the ruling in Rajendra Prasad, as well as
			<lb />
			Jagmohan Singh, the Constitution Bench in Bachan Singh held
			<lb />
			that the court must give equal emphasis to both the crime and the
			<lb />
			criminal. It was noted that often the circumstance with relation to
			<lb />
			the crime are intertwined with the circumstances relating to the
			<lb />
			criminal.
			<lb />
			The Constitution Bench also refused to be drawn into the
			<lb />
			standardization or categorization of cases for awarding the death
			<lb />
			penalty observing in para 201 that -it is not desirable to consider
			<lb />
			the circumstances of the crime and the circumstances of the
			<lb />
			criminal in two separate water tight compartments&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			46. In Bachan Singh, the following circumstances referred to by
			<lb />
			counsel were noted as may be considered aggravating (para 202):
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) If the murder is pre-planned, and involves extreme
			<lb />
			brutality;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) If the murder involves extreme depravity;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(c) If the murder is of a member of the police or the
			<lb />
			armed forces, and is committed when the person was on
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 26
			<lb />
			duty, or in consequence of the public servant actions in the
			<lb />
			course of his/her duty;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(d) If the murder is of a person who acted lawfully under
			<lb />
			sections 37 and / or 43 of the Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			47. Possible mitigating circumstances noted by the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court (in para 206) are :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			a)
			<lb />
			That the offence was committed under the influence of
			<lb />
			extreme emotion or mental disturbance;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			b)
			<lb />
			The young/or old age of the accused;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			c)
			<lb />
			That the accused would not commit violent acts in the
			<lb />
			future and would not be a continuing threat to society;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			d)
			<lb />
			That the accused can be reformed and rehabilitated;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			e)
			<lb />
			That in the facts and circumstances of the case, the
			<lb />
			accused believed that he was morally justified in committing
			<lb />
			the offence;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			f)
			<lb />
			That the accused acted under duress or the dominance
			<lb />
			or another person;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			g)
			<lb />
			That the accused was mentally defective and that
			<lb />
			defect impaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of
			<lb />
			his conduct.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			48. Of course a clarification had been given by the Bench in
			<lb />
			Bachan Singh that the above lists are not exhaustive but were
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 27
			<lb />
			relevant and that it is not desirable to consider the circumstances of
			<lb />
			the crime and the circumstances of the criminal in two separate
			<lb />
			water tight compartments. The need for principled sentencing
			<lb />
			based on special reasons has been strongly emphasized.
			<lb />
			In this pronouncement, while reiterating that the court must
			<lb />
			give equal emphasis to both the crime and the criminal, the court
			<lb />
			did not suggest a ‗balance sheet&apos; approach which was suggested in
			<lb />
			later jurisprudence. The constitutionality of the death penalty was
			<lb />
			upheld as a framework for principled sentencing, based on
			<lb />
			providing special reasons, was already in place.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			49. The exercise of identifying the guidelines (from which the
			<lb />
			court refrained in Bachan Singh) was undertaken by the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in the judgment reported at (1983) 3 SCC 470, Machhi
			<lb />
			Singh and Ors. v. State of Punjab (paras 32 -39) which was
			<lb />
			decided by a three judge bench of the Supreme Court. Reference
			<lb />
			was made to this formulation as the -rarest of rare case‖ principle
			<lb />
			holding that if certain factors were present in a particular case, the
			<lb />
			court would have to impose the death penalty since the collective
			<lb />
			conscience of the community would be shocked. Thus, we see the
			<lb />
			evolution of the -balance sheet‖ approach. The five factors
			<lb />
			(extracted from paras 32 to 37 of the pronouncement) would
			<lb />
			include:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			If the crime is committed in an extremely brutal,
			<lb />
			grotesque, diabolical, revolting, or dastardly manner;
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 28
			<lb />
			(ii) When the murder is committed with a motive that
			<lb />
			evinces total depravity and meanness;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii) When the crime is of an anti-social or socially
			<lb />
			abhorrent nature;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv) When the crime is enormous in proportion
			<lb />
			(v) When the victim is a child, a helpless woman or an
			<lb />
			old/infirm person, when the victim a person vis-a-vis whom
			<lb />
			the murderer is in a position of trust or authority, when the
			<lb />
			victim is a public figure who has been murdered because of
			<lb />
			political or similar reasons.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			50. The Supreme Court also culled out the following principles
			<lb />
			and guidelines:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The death sentence should be imposed only in the
			<lb />
			gravest cases;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) The circumstances of the offender also need to be
			<lb />
			taken into consideration, and not only the circumstances of
			<lb />
			the crime;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(iii) Life imprisonment is the rule, and death sentence the
			<lb />
			exception. The death sentence should be imposed if the
			<lb />
			court finds that life imprisonment is an altogether inadequate
			<lb />
			punishment in the light of the nature and circumstances of
			<lb />
			the crime;
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg.
		</p>
		<p>
			29
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv) A balance-sheet of aggravating and mitigating
			<lb />
			circumstances should be drawn up and equal importance
			<lb />
			should be given to both aggravating and mitigating
			<lb />
			circumstances.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			51. Further attempts to get the capital punishment declared
			<lb />
			unconstitutional and a reconsideration of the view taken in Bachan
			<lb />
			Singh was rejected by the Supreme Court in (1992) 1 SCC 96;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(1992) SC 395, Shashi Nayar v. Union of India. In AIR 1989 SC
			<lb />
			1335 : (1989) 1 SCC 678 Triveniben v. State of Gujarat (paras 10
			<lb />
			and 11), the Supreme Court referred to the balance sheet theory
			<lb />
			propounded in Machhi Singh and again observed that there can be
			<lb />
			no enumeration of circumstances in which the extreme penalty
			<lb />
			should be inflicted given the complex situation, society and
			<lb />
			possibilities in which the offence could be committed. The
			<lb />
			Supreme Court again approved the discretion left by the
			<lb />
			Legislature to the judicial decision as to what should be the
			<lb />
			appropriate sentence in the particular circumstances of the case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			52. The Supreme Court has expressed grave concern with the
			<lb />
			manner in which question of sentence is dealt with by the courts in
			<lb />
			the judgment reported at (1994) 4 SCC 381, Anshad &amp; Ors. v.
			<lb />
			State of Karnataka (para 17), the court criticized the cryptic
			<lb />
			manner in which the trial court dealt with the question of sentence
			<lb />
			as, after pronouncing the order of conviction, on the same day itself
			<lb />
			it passed a one paragraph order dealing with the question of
			<lb />
			sentence. In para 17, the Supreme Court observed that this
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 30
			<lb />
			exposed the lack of sensitiveness on the part of the Sessions Judge
			<lb />
			while dealing with the question of sentence. In para 14, the court
			<lb />
			also faulted the reasons given by the High Court for awarding the
			<lb />
			death sentence and observed that for determining the proper
			<lb />
			sentence in a case like the one under consideration, the court while
			<lb />
			taking into account the aggravating circumstances should not
			<lb />
			overlook or ignore the mitigating circumstances.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			53. The Supreme Court observed that principles of deterrence
			<lb />
			and retribution are the cornerstones of sentencing in (1994) 2 SCC
			<lb />
			220, Dhananjoy Chatterjee Vs. State of West Bengal and (1996) 6
			<lb />
			SCC 241, Gentela Vijayavandhan Rao v. State of Andhara
			<lb />
			Pradesh. It was also observed that these principles also cannot be
			<lb />
			categorised as right or wrong as much depends upon the belief of
			<lb />
			the judges. The court extracted the following portion of the
			<lb />
			decision of the Supreme Court in (2006) 2 SCC 359, Shailash
			<lb />
			Jasvantbhai v. State of Gujarat :
			<lb />
			-7. xxx xxx Protection of society and stamping out
			<lb />
			criminal proclivity must be the object of law which
			<lb />
			must be achieved by imposing appropriate sentence.
			<lb />
			Therefore, law as a cornerstone of the edifice of &quot;order&quot;
			<lb />
			should meet the challenges confronting the society. xxx
			<lb />
			xxx Therefore, in operating the sentencing system, law
			<lb />
			should adopt the corrective machinery or deterrence
			<lb />
			based on factual matrix. By deft modulation, sentencing
			<lb />
			process be stern where it should be, and tempered with
			<lb />
			mercy where it warrants to be. The facts and given
			<lb />
			circumstances in each case, the nature of the crime, the
			<lb />
			manner in which it was planned and committed, the
			<lb />
			motive for commission of the crime, the conduct of the
			<lb />
			accused, the nature of weapons used and all other
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 31
			<lb />
			attending circumstances are relevant facts which would
			<lb />
			enter into the area of consideration.‖
			<lb />
			(Underlining by us)
			<lb />
			Death sentence jurisprudence -divergence in views
			<lb />
			The discussion on this subject is being considered under the
			<lb />
			following sub-headings:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			I.
			<lb />
			Cases where the Supreme Court imposed the death
			<lb />
			penalty
			<lb />
			II.
			<lb />
			Cases where the Supreme Court did not impose the
			<lb />
			death penalty
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			54. Unfortunately, the Indian judicial system has not been able
			<lb />
			to develop legal principles as regards sentencing and superior
			<lb />
			courts have repeatedly made observations with regard to the
			<lb />
			purport, object for and manner in which punishment is imposed on
			<lb />
			an offender.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			55. In the judgment reported at (2007) 12 SCC 288, Swamy
			<lb />
			Shraddananda v. State of Karnataka, the two Judges Bench of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court differed on whether the appellant should be given
			<lb />
			the death sentence or sentenced to imprisonment for life. As a
			<lb />
			result, a Bench of three Judges of the Supreme Court was
			<lb />
			constituted to decide the issue of sentence. In para 42 of the
			<lb />
			judgment reported at (2008) 13 SCC 767, Swamy Shraddhananda
			<lb />
			v. State of Karnataka, it was again observed that the two earlier
			<lb />
			Constitution Benches had resolutely refrained from the
			<lb />
			standardization and classification of the circumstances in which
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 32
			<lb />
			death sentence could be imposed. However, in Machhi Singh, the
			<lb />
			court had grafted some categories in which the community should
			<lb />
			demand the death sentence. Noting the variations on account of
			<lb />
			the passage of time since 20 th July, 1983 when Machhi Singh was
			<lb />
			decided, the Court held that though the categories framed in
			<lb />
			Machhi Singh are useful, they cannot be taken as -inflexible,
			<lb />
			absolute or immutable‖ (para 28). It further ruled that the -rarest
			<lb />
			of rare case‖ formulation is a relative theory which requires
			<lb />
			comparison with other cases of murder; Machhi Singh translated
			<lb />
			this relative category into absolute terms by framing five
			<lb />
			categories. In Swamy Shraddananda, the court observed that in
			<lb />
			interpreting Bachan Singh, Machhi Singh had actually enlarged
			<lb />
			the scope of cases by which the death penalty should be imposed
			<lb />
			beyond what the Constitution Bench in Bachan Singh had
			<lb />
			envisaged. Machhi Singh laid down the rarest of rare criteria (para
			<lb />
			27).
			<lb />
			The court reviewed its previous decisions observing the
			<lb />
			inconsistency in the death sentencing decisions; noting that the
			<lb />
			imposition of this penalty was not free from the subjective element
			<lb />
			and the confirmation of death sentence or its commutation depends
			<lb />
			a good deal on the personal predilection of the Judges constituting
			<lb />
			the Bench (para 33).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			56. In the judgment reported at (2007) 12 SCC 230, Aloke Nath
			<lb />
			Dutta v. State of West Bengal, the Supreme Court reviewed a
			<lb />
			series of cases where the option to impose the death sentence was
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 33
			<lb />
			available to the Supreme Court. It was noted that in cases with
			<lb />
			similar facts, while death sentence was imposed in some of the
			<lb />
			cases, in other cases with similar facts, life imprisonment was
			<lb />
			imposed. The court listed various cases where the murder is
			<lb />
			committed in a brutal manner. In some of these cases, the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court had imposed death penalty whereas in others, life
			<lb />
			imprisonment was imposed on the convicted person. Similarly in
			<lb />
			cases involving rape and murder, while death sentence was
			<lb />
			imposed in some cases, the offenders were sentenced to life
			<lb />
			imprisonment in others.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			57. In Aloke Nath Dutta, even though the murder had been
			<lb />
			committed in a brutal manner, the court did not uphold the death
			<lb />
			sentence imposed by the Trial Court and confirmed by the High
			<lb />
			Court. One of the factors that weighed with the court was that the
			<lb />
			case had been proved on the basis of circumstantial evidence and it
			<lb />
			was required that in cases where offence is proved on the basis of
			<lb />
			circumstantial evidence, the death penalty ought not to be imposed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			58. In the judgment reported at (2008) 7 SCC 550, State of
			<lb />
			Punjab v. Prem Sagar &amp; Ors., the Supreme Court expressed
			<lb />
			serious concern in this behalf pointing out the recommendations of
			<lb />
			committees as the Madhava Menon Committee &amp; the Malimath
			<lb />
			Committee for framing of sentencing guidelines. It was, however,
			<lb />
			observed that while awarding a sentence, whether the court would
			<lb />
			take recourse to the principles of deterrence or reform, or invoke
			<lb />
			the doctrine of proportionality, would depend upon the facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of each case. While the nature of the offence
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 34
			<lb />
			committed by the accused plays an important role, the sociological
			<lb />
			background and the age of the convicts, the circumstances in which
			<lb />
			the crime has been committed, his mental state are also relevant
			<lb />
			factors in awarding the sentences.
			<lb />
			In Prem Sagar, the Supreme Court emphasised that while
			<lb />
			imposing the death sentence, the courts must take into
			<lb />
			consideration the principles applicable thereto, the purpose of
			<lb />
			imposition of sentence and impose a death sentence after
			<lb />
			application of mind.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			59. Strong articulation for the essentiality of a proper pre-
			<lb />
			sentencing hearing is to be found in the pronouncement of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court reported at (2009) 6 SCC 498, Santosh Kumar
			<lb />
			Satish Bhushan Bariyar v. State of Maharashtra. The Supreme
			<lb />
			Court has been deeply concerned about emphasizing three broad
			<lb />
			points on death penalty i.e. the difficulty on account of judge
			<lb />
			centric sentencing (paras 46 to 52); the importance of the -rarest
			<lb />
			of rare case‖ (paras 53 to 59) formulation which placed -extreme
			<lb />
			burden‖ on a court and the requirement of the court to conform to
			<lb />
			the highest standards of judicial rigor and thoroughness to ensure
			<lb />
			pre-sentencing (paras 90 to 93). The court held that an effective
			<lb />
			compliance of sentencing procedure under Section 354(3) and
			<lb />
			Section 235(2) Cr.P.C and existence of sufficient judicial
			<lb />
			discretion is a pre-condition. A scrupulous compliance with these
			<lb />
			statutory provisions is essential so that an informed selection of an
			<lb />
			adequate sentence could be based on information collected at the
			<lb />
			pre-sentencing stage.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 35
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			60. In Santosh Kumar Satish Bhushan Bariyar, the court also
			<lb />
			declared as per incuriam the decision of the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			(1996) 2 SCC 175, AIR 1996 SC 787 Ravji v. State of Rajasthan
			<lb />
			and the decisions which followed it for the reason that while
			<lb />
			considering the sentence they took notice of only the characteristics
			<lb />
			relating to the crime, to the exclusion of the ones relating to the
			<lb />
			criminal being contrary to the rule enunciated by the Constitutional
			<lb />
			Bench in Bachan Singh that equal weight must be given to both
			<lb />
			crime and the criminal.
			<lb />
			The Supreme Court clearly declared that equal weight
			<lb />
			should be given to both the aggravating and mitigating
			<lb />
			circumstances and reiterated the principle that the principled
			<lb />
			approach of sentencing applies equally to heinous crimes as well as
			<lb />
			to ‗relatively less brutal murders&apos;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			61. At this stage, it is necessary to refer to the two Judge Bench
			<lb />
			pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (2013) 2 SCC
			<lb />
			452 : (2012) 11 SCALE 140, Sangeet &amp; Anr. v. State of Haryana
			<lb />
			wherein the court held that the considerations for mitigating and
			<lb />
			aggravating circumstances are distinct and unrelated elements and
			<lb />
			cannot be compared with each other. In para 29 of the report, it
			<lb />
			was clearly stated by the Bench that a &quot;balance sheet cannot be
			<lb />
			drawn up of two distinct and different constituents of an incident&quot;.
			<lb />
			The judgment further notes that there was lack of evenness in the
			<lb />
			sentencing process; that the rarest of rare principle as well as the
			<lb />
			balance sheet approach has been followed on a case by case basis
			<lb />
			which has not worked sufficiently well. In para 33, the court also
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 36
			<lb />
			observed that even though Bachan Singh intended &quot;principled
			<lb />
			sentencing&quot;, the sentencing had become judge-centric as had also
			<lb />
			been highlighted in Swamy Shraddananda (2) and Santosh
			<lb />
			Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			62. In Sangeet, it was noted that &quot;rarest of rare case&quot; doctrine
			<lb />
			had been inconsistently applied by the High Courts as well as the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court, thereby implying that the aggravating and
			<lb />
			mitigating circumstances approach had not been effectively
			<lb />
			interpreted. It was observed that Bachan Singh did not endorse
			<lb />
			the aggravating and mitigating circumstances approach. In this
			<lb />
			judgment, the Supreme Court therefore, emphasized the necessity
			<lb />
			of a fresh look at the approach as well as the necessity of adopting
			<lb />
			the same.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			63. In this evaluation of the jurisprudence, it is essential to note
			<lb />
			the pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (2013) 5 SCC
			<lb />
			546, Shankar Kisanrao Khade v. State of Maharashtra in which
			<lb />
			the appellant, a man of 52 years, had been convicted for murder
			<lb />
			and strangulation of an 11 year old minor girl with intellectual
			<lb />
			disability after repeated rape and sodomy. Despite the satisfaction
			<lb />
			of the crime test, the criminal test and the rarest of rare case test,
			<lb />
			the court was of the view that the extreme sentence of death
			<lb />
			penalty was not warranted. The court therefore, directed the life
			<lb />
			sentence awarded for rape and murder to run consecutively. It was
			<lb />
			noted in the judgment of Radhakrishnan, J. that in similar
			<lb />
			circumstances of rape and murder of minor girls, there had been
			<lb />
			inconsistency in the award of death penalty. While in 10 cases,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 37
			<lb />
			death penalty had been awarded, in eight others, it had been
			<lb />
			commuted. In the concurring judgment of Madan B. Lokur, J. an
			<lb />
			exhaustive list of cases was set out in para 106 where the death
			<lb />
			penalty stood commuted to life imprisonment. In para 49, the
			<lb />
			Bench reiterated the aggravating circumstances (crime test) and the
			<lb />
			mitigating circumstances (criminal test) as illustrations. It was
			<lb />
			pointed out in Bachan Singh that for the fourth mitigating
			<lb />
			circumstance enumerated therein i.e. the -chance of the accused of
			<lb />
			not indulging in commission of the crime again and the probability
			<lb />
			of the accused being reformed and rehabilitated‖, the State ought
			<lb />
			to produce evidence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			64. Before us, Mr. Sumeet Verma has staunchly emphasized
			<lb />
			para 52 of Shankar Kisanrao Khade which reads thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;52. Aggravating circumstances as pointed out above,
			<lb />
			of course, are not exhaustive so also the mitigating
			<lb />
			circumstances. In my considered view, the tests that we
			<lb />
			have to apply, while awarding death sentence are -crime
			<lb />
			test‖, -criminal test‖ and the -R-R test‖ and not the
			<lb />
			-balancing test‖. To award death sentence, the -crime
			<lb />
			test‖ has to be fully satisfied, that is, 100% and
			<lb />
			-criminal test‖ 0%, that is, no mitigating circumstance
			<lb />
			favouring the accused. If there is any circumstance
			<lb />
			favouring the accused, like lack of intention to commit
			<lb />
			the crime, possibility of reformation, young age of the
			<lb />
			accused, not a menace to the society, no previous track
			<lb />
			record, etc. the -criminal test‖ may favour the accused
			<lb />
			to avoid the capital punishment. Even if both the tests
			<lb />
			are satisfied, that is, the aggravating circumstances to
			<lb />
			the fullest extent and no mitigating circumstances
			<lb />
			favouring the accused, still we have to apply finally the
			<lb />
			rarest of the rare case test (R-R test). R-R test depends
			<lb />
			upon the perception of the society that is -society-

			<lb />
			pg. 38
			<lb />
			centric‖ and not -Judge-centric‖, that is, whether the
			<lb />
			society will approve the awarding of death sentence to
			<lb />
			certain types of crimes or not. While applying that test,
			<lb />
			the court has to look into variety of factors like society&apos;s
			<lb />
			abhorrence, extreme indignation and antipathy to certain
			<lb />
			types of crimes like sexual assault and murder of
			<lb />
			intellectually challenged minor girls, suffering from
			<lb />
			physical disability, old and infirm women with those
			<lb />
			disabilities, etc. Examples are only illustrative and not
			<lb />
			exhaustive. The courts award death sentence since
			<lb />
			situation demands so, due to constitutional compulsion,
			<lb />
			reflected by the will of the people and not the will of the
			<lb />
			Judges.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
			Mr. Sumeet Verma emphasises the 100% crime test and 0%
			<lb />
			criminal test evaluation as pointed out in para 52 above urging that
			<lb />
			even if there was a single mitigating circumstance (young age or
			<lb />
			probability of reformation, etc.), the convict would not be
			<lb />
			sentenced to death.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			65. Mr. Sumeet Verma would submit that post Shinde (D.O.D.
			<lb />
			27 th February, 2014), para 52 of Shankar Kisanrao Khade has
			<lb />
			been followed in (2014) 8 SCALE 365, Santosh Kumar Singh v.
			<lb />
			State of Madhya Pradesh (D.O.D. 3 rd July, 2014); (2014) 11 SCC
			<lb />
			129, Lalit Kumar Yadav @ Kuri v. State of Uttar Pradesh (D.O.D.
			<lb />
			25 th April, 2014); (2014) 5 SCC 509, Dharam Deo Yadav v. State
			<lb />
			of Uttar Pradesh (D.O.D. 11 th April, 2014) and; (2014) 4 SCC 747
			<lb />
			: 2014 (3) SCALE 344, Ashok Debbarma v. State of Tripura
			<lb />
			(D.O.D. 4 th March, 2014).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			66. It has been pointed out that though Dharam Deo Yadav
			<lb />
			refers to the crime test, criminal test as well as R.R. test but the 0%
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 39
			<lb />
			criminal and 100% crime theory concept has not been followed. It
			<lb />
			is noteworthy that in Dharam Deo Yadav, the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			awarded rigorous imprisonment of 20 years over and above the
			<lb />
			period already undergone by the accused without any remission.
			<lb />
			So far as Lalit Kumar Yadav @ Kuri is concerned, in para 46, the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court has discussed the balancing of the circumstances.
			<lb />
			If the absolute test of 0% and 100% had to be applied, obviously
			<lb />
			there would not be any question of the balancing exercise which
			<lb />
			stands undertaken. In Santosh Kumar Singh, though reference has
			<lb />
			been made to para 52 of Shankar Kisanrao Khade but it does not
			<lb />
			appear as if the 0% criminal test and 100% crime test was actually
			<lb />
			applied.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			67. Mr. Mahajan has drawn our attention to a consideration of
			<lb />
			this very argument in Death Ref.No.1/2014, State v. Ravi Kumar
			<lb />
			before a co-ordinate Bench of this court. The argument was
			<lb />
			rejected holding that Mahesh Dhanaji Shinde furnished the
			<lb />
			complete answer to the question canvassed by the defence. In fact,
			<lb />
			death sentence was awarded in this case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			68. Countering these submissions of Mr. Verma, Mr. P.K. Dey,
			<lb />
			learned counsel for the complainant has placed the decision of the
			<lb />
			three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court reported at (2014) 4 SCC
			<lb />
			292, Mahesh Dhanaji Shinde v. State of Maharashtra wherein in
			<lb />
			para 31, it was held thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;31. A reference to several other pronouncements made
			<lb />
			by this Court at different points of time with regard to
			<lb />
			what could be considered as mitigating and aggravating
			<lb />
			circumstances and how they are to be reconciled has
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 40
			<lb />
			already been detailed hereinabove. All that would be
			<lb />
			necessary to say is that the Constitution Bench in
			<lb />
			Bachan Singh [Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, (1980)
			<lb />
			2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 580] had sounded a note of
			<lb />
			caution against treating the aggravating and mitigating
			<lb />
			circumstances in separate watertight compartments as in
			<lb />
			many situations it may be impossible to isolate them and
			<lb />
			both sets of circumstances will have to be considered to
			<lb />
			cull out the cumulative effect thereof.
		</p>
		<head>
			Viewed in the
			<lb />
			aforesaid context the observations contained in para
			<lb />
			52 of Shankar Kisanrao Khade [Shankar Kisanrao
			<lb />
			Khade v. State of Maharashtra, (2013) 5 SCC 546 :
			<lb />
			(2013) 3 SCC (Cri) 402] noted above, namely, 100%
			<lb />
			Crime Test and 0% Criminal Test may create
			<lb />
			situations which may well go beyond what was laid
			<lb />
			down in Bachan
		</head>

			<lb />
			Punjab, (1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 580].‖

			69. At the same time, Mr. Rajesh Mahajan, learned APP for the
			<lb />
			State and Mr. P.K. Dey, learned counsel for the complainant have
			<lb />
			drawn our attention to the pronouncements in (2013) 10 SCC 421,
			<lb />
			Deepak Rai v. State of Bihar; AIR 2011 SC 3690, Ajitsingh
			<lb />
			Harnamsingh Gujral v. State of Maharashtra; (2010) 9 SCC 1,

			<lb />
			wherein the view which was taken in Mahesh Dhanaji Shinde has
			<lb />
			been followed.

		</p>
		<p>
			70. In a recent pronouncement dated 26 th November, 2014 of a
			<lb />
			three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Criminal Appeal
			<lb />
			Nos.2486-2487 of 2014 (Arising out of SLP(Crl.)No.330-331 of
			<lb />
			2013), Vasant Sampat Dupare v. State of Maharashtra, the court
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 41
			<lb />
			has noted with approval the two Judge Bench judgment reported at
			<lb />
			(2011) 12 SCC 56, Haresh Mohandas Rajput v. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra dealing with a situation where the death sentence
			<lb />
			was warranted. We may usefully extract the relevant portion
			<lb />
			culling out the principles in Haresh Mohandas Rajput (which
			<lb />
			have been quoted in para 45 of Vasant Sampat Dupare as well)
			<lb />
			which read thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-In Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab this Court
			<lb />
			expanded the -rarest of rare‖ formulation beyond the
			<lb />
			aggravating factors listed in Bachan Singh to cases
			<lb />
			where the -collective conscience‖ of the community is
			<lb />
			so shocked that it will expect the holders of the judicial
			<lb />
			power centre to inflict the death penalty irrespective of
			<lb />
			their personal opinion as regards desirability or
			<lb />
			otherwise of retaining the death penalty, such a penalty
			<lb />
			can be inflicted. But the Bench in this case underlined
			<lb />
			that full weightage must be accorded to the mitigating
			<lb />
			circumstances in a case and a just balance had to be
			<lb />
			struck between the aggravating and the mitigating
			<lb />
			circumstances.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The Supreme Court thereafter reiterated the considerations
			<lb />
			which go into the &quot;rarest of rare&quot; formulation also considered in
			<lb />
			(2010) 9 SCC 567, C. Muniappan v. State of T.N.; (2011) 2 SCC
			<lb />
			490, Dara Singh v. Republic of India; (2011) 4 SCC 80, Surendra
			<lb />
			Koli v. State of U.P.; (2011) 5 SCC 317, Md. Mannan v. State of
			<lb />
			Bihar; (2011) 7 SCC 125, Sudam v. State of Maharashtra.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			71. It is the law laid down by the Constitution Bench in Bachan
			<lb />
			Singh, followed in three Judge Bench pronouncement in Mahesh
			<lb />
			Dhanaji Shinde which has to bind this court. It is therefore,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 42
			<lb />
			unnecessary to advert in detail to the judgments wherein para 52 of
			<lb />
			Shankar Kisanrao Khade has been followed. We have however,
			<lb />
			extracted all the judgments hereafter while listing the based on
			<lb />
			consideration of relevant circumstances in the several precedents.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			72. We hereafter set down in extenso the words of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in (2014) 4 SCC 317 Sushil Sharma v. State (NCT of Delhi)
			<lb />
			after noticing the several pronouncements placed on either side
			<lb />
			before it on the manner in which circumstances in the cases would
			<lb />
			deserve to be evaluated to arrive at a conclusion as to whether
			<lb />
			death penalty was warranted in the case or not:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;100. In light of the above judgments, we would now
			<lb />
			ascertain what factors which we need to take into
			<lb />
			consideration while deciding the question of sentence.
			<lb />
			Undoubtedly, we must locate the aggravating and
			<lb />
			mitigating circumstances in this case and strike the right
			<lb />
			balance. We must also consider whether there is
			<lb />
			anything uncommon in this case which renders the
			<lb />
			sentence to life imprisonment inadequate and calls for
			<lb />
			death sentence. It is also necessary to see whether the
			<lb />
			circumstances of the crime are such that there is no
			<lb />
			alternative but to impose death sentence even after
			<lb />
			according maximum weightage to the mitigating
			<lb />
			circumstances which speak in favour of the offender.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			101. We notice from the above judgments that mere
			<lb />
			brutality of the murder or the number of persons killed
			<lb />
			or the manner in which the body is disposed of has not
			<lb />
			always persuaded this Court to impose death penalty.
			<lb />
			Similarly, at times, in the peculiar factual matrix, this
			<lb />
			Court has not thought it fit to award death penalty in
			<lb />
			cases, which rested on circumstantial evidence or solely
			<lb />
			on approver&apos;s evidence. Where murder, though brutal, is
			<lb />
			committed driven by extreme emotional disturbance and
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 43
			<lb />
			it does not have enormous proportion, the option of life
			<lb />
			imprisonment has been exercised in certain cases.
			<lb />
			Extreme poverty and social status has also been taken
			<lb />
			into account amongst other circumstances for not
			<lb />
			awarding death sentence. In few cases, time spent by the
			<lb />
			accused in death cell has been taken into consideration
			<lb />
			along with other circumstances, to commute death
			<lb />
			sentence into life imprisonment. Where the accused had
			<lb />
			no criminal antecedents; where the State had not led any
			<lb />
			evidence to show that the accused is beyond reformation
			<lb />
			and rehabilitation or that he would revert to similar
			<lb />
			crimes in future, this Court has leaned in favour of life
			<lb />
			imprisonment. In such cases, doctrine of proportionality
			<lb />
			and the theory of deterrence have taken a back seat. The
			<lb />
			theory of reformation and rehabilitation has prevailed
			<lb />
			over the idea of retribution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			102. On the other hand, rape followed by a cold-blooded
			<lb />
			murder of a minor girl and further followed by
			<lb />
			disrespect to the body of the victim has been often held
			<lb />
			to be an offence attracting death penalty. At times, cases
			<lb />
			exhibiting premeditation and meticulous execution of
			<lb />
			the plan to murder by levelling a calculated attack on the
			<lb />
			victim to annihilate him, have been held to be fit cases
			<lb />
			for imposing death penalty. Where innocent minor
			<lb />
			children, unarmed persons, hapless women and old and
			<lb />
			infirm persons have been killed in a brutal manner by
			<lb />
			persons in dominating position, and where after ghastly
			<lb />
			murder displaying depraved mentality, the accused have
			<lb />
			shown no remorse, death penalty has been imposed.
			<lb />
			Where it is established that the accused is a confirmed
			<lb />
			criminal and has committed murder in a diabolical
			<lb />
			manner and where it is felt that reformation and
			<lb />
			rehabilitation of such a person is impossible and if let
			<lb />
			free, he would be a menace to the society, this Court has
			<lb />
			not hesitated to confirm death sentence. Many a time, in
			<lb />
			cases of brutal murder, exhibiting depravity and sick
			<lb />
			mind, this Court has acknowledged the need to send a
			<lb />
			deterrent message to those who may embark on such
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 44
			<lb />
			crimes in future. In some cases involving brutal
			<lb />
			murders, society&apos;s cry for justice has been taken note of
			<lb />
			by this Court, amongst other relevant factors. But, one
			<lb />
			thing is certain that while deciding whether death
			<lb />
			penalty should be awarded or not, this Court has in each
			<lb />
			case realising the irreversible nature of the sentence,
			<lb />
			pondered over the issue many times over. This Court
			<lb />
			has always kept in mind the caution sounded by the
			<lb />
			Constitution
			<lb />
			Bench
			<lb />
			in Bachan
			<lb />
			Singh [Bachan
			<lb />
			Singh v. State of Punjab, (1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC
			<lb />
			(Cri) 580] that Judges should never be bloodthirsty but
			<lb />
			has wherever necessary in the interest of society located
			<lb />
			the rarest of the rare case and exercised the tougher
			<lb />
			option of death penalty.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			103. In the nature of things, there can be no hard-and-
			<lb />
			fast rules which the court can follow while considering
			<lb />
			whether an accused should be awarded death sentence
			<lb />
			or not. The core of a criminal case is its facts and, the
			<lb />
			facts differ from case to case.
		</p>
		<item>
			Therefore, the various
			<lb />
			factors like the age of the criminal, his social status, his
			<lb />
			background, whether he is a confirmed criminal or not,
			<lb />
			whether he had any antecedents, whether there is any
			<lb />
			possibility of his reformation and rehabilitation or
			<lb />
			whether it is a case where the reformation is impossible
			<lb />
			and the accused is likely to revert to such crimes in
			<lb />
			future and become a threat to the society are factors
			<lb />
			which the criminal court will have to examine
			<lb />
			independently in each case. Decision whether to impose
			<lb />
			death penalty or not must be taken in the light of
			<lb />
			guiding principles laid down in several authoritative
			<lb />
			pronouncements of this Court in the facts and attendant
			<lb />
			circumstances of each case.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The consideration by this court has to abide by the above
			<lb />
			principles.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

			<lb />
			Consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances
			<lb />
			73. For the purposes of convenience and consideration, the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court&apos;s approach to death sentencing may thus be divided
			<lb />
			into phases. The decision of the Supreme Court&apos;s three Judge
			<lb />
			Bench in May, 2008 in Swamy Shraddananda (2) marks the
			<lb />
			commencement of one such phase. Taking this as the focal point,
			<lb />
			we propose to consider cases decided by the Supreme Court post
			<lb />
			May, 2008 where factors similar to the ones identified by the
			<lb />
			learned Additional Sessions Judges in the instant case as well as
			<lb />
			the parties were present. This would assist this court in assessing
			<lb />
			an appropriate sentence to be imposed on the defendants. Mr.
			<lb />
			Rajesh Mahajan, Mr. Sumeet Verma and Mr. P.K. Dey, Advocates
			<lb />
			have painstakingly taken us through the jurisprudence on these
			<lb />
			issues. We first propose to list circumstances and some of the
			<lb />
			cases wherein existence thereof led to the court imposing death
			<lb />
			penalty and thereafter where the court imposed life imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			I.
			<lb />
			Cases where the Supreme Court imposed the death penalty.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(A) BRUTAL NATURE OF THE CRIME : Brutality of the
			<lb />
			offence was the primary reason for the court to conclude that the
			<lb />
			case fitted the &quot;rarest of rare&quot; category.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			74. In the following cases death penalty has been imposed for
			<lb />
			this reason:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Burning the victims alive
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) AIR 2011 SC 3690, Ajitsingh Harnamsingh Gujral v. State
			<lb />
			of Maharashtra : The appellant doused his wife, son and two
			<lb />
			daughters in petrol and set them afire. The court noted that life
			<lb />
			imprisonment should be given for &quot;ordinary murders&quot; and death
			<lb />
			sentence for gruesome, ghastly and horrendous murders. Death
			<lb />
			sentence was imposed on the appellant.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(b) (2010) 10 SCC 611, Sunder Singh v. State of Uttaranchal :
			<lb />
			Six people were locked in their house, which was doused with
			<lb />
			petrol and set on fire. Four of them (including a 16 year old girl)
			<lb />
			were burnt alive. One managed to escape from the burning house
			<lb />
			but was attacked with a sword and killed by a blow which nearly
			<lb />
			decapitated him. Brutality of the murder was considered the
			<lb />
			aggravating factor.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(c) (2010) 9 SCC 567, C. Muniappan v. State of Tamil Nadu :
			<lb />
			The victims were young female university students whose bus was
			<lb />
			stopped by political workers organizing a &apos;rasta roko&apos;. The
			<lb />
			appellant and accomplices threw petrol into the bus and set it on
			<lb />
			fire leading to the death of three girls. It was held that since the
			<lb />
			murder of three unarmed women was brutal, grotesque,
			<lb />
			unprovoked and pre-planned, the appellant should be sentenced to
			<lb />
			death.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) Multiple stab injuries
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(a) (2010) 9 SCC 1, Atbir v. Government (N.C.T. of Delhi) :
			<lb />
			The appellant with accomplices murdered his step mother and her
			<lb />
			two young children by stabbing them repeatedly. The brutality of
			<lb />
			the attack with the &quot;breach of trust&quot; were considered aggravating
			<lb />
			factors. The court rejected the appellant&apos;s young age (28 years)
			<lb />
			factor.
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Maharashtra : Six people were killed in an act of dacoity and
			<lb />
			murder. One of them, a fifteen year old girl, was also raped before

			Three sleeping children, aged 8, 15 and 16, were murdered by
			<lb />
			multiple stabbing by the appellant who was a tenant in their house

			<lb />
			(a) (2012) 4 SCC 37, Rajendra Prahladrao Wasnik v. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra : The appellant, a 31 year old man, was convicted for
			<lb />
			raping and murdering a three year old girl. Bite marks on the chest
			<lb />
			of the child and various injuries to her private parts were found.
			<lb />
			Her naked body was left in the open fields. The appellant belied
			<lb />
			the human relationship of trust and confidence and worthiness
			<lb />
			leaving the deceased in a badly injured condition in open fields
			<lb />
			without even clothes reflective of most unfortunate abusive facet of
			<lb />
			human conduct. The brutal manner of commission of the offences
			<lb />
			and the above circumstances led the court to conclude that the
			<lb />
			appellant deserved to be sentenced to death.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) (2011) 5 SCC 317, Md. Mannan v. State of Bihar : The
			<lb />
			appellant, a 43 year old man, was convicted of raping and
			<lb />
			murdering an eight year old girl. He was working as a mason in
			<lb />
			the victim&apos;s uncle&apos;s house and therefore, when asked to do so, she
			<lb />
			willingly accompanied the appellant. &quot;Breach of trust&quot; was
			<lb />
			considered an aggravating factor. The victim also had multiple
			<lb />
			injuries on her face which indicated the brutality of the crime. The
			<lb />
			vulnerability of the victim who was of a small built was also
			<lb />
			factored by the court and it was held that the appellant was a
			<lb />
			&quot;menace to the society&quot; and could not be reformed. Hence death
			<lb />
			sentence was imposed.

			(c) (2008) 11 SCC 113, Bantu v. State of Uttar Pradesh : The
			<lb />
			appellant inserted a stick into the vagina of a six year old girl
			<lb />
			causing her death. Placing reliance on the judgment in Ravji, death
			<lb />
			sentence was imposed. In (2008) 7 SCC 561, Mohan Anna
			<lb />
			Chavan v. State of Maharashtra and (2008) 15 SCC 269, Shivaji
			<lb />
			v. State of Maharashtra also reliance was place on Ravji which the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court has held to be per incuriam. Mohan Anna Chavan
			<lb />
			was convicted for raping and murdering two girls aged 5 and 10.
			<lb />
			He had two prior convictions for raping under age girls. Shivaji
			<lb />
			was convicted for raping and murdering a nine year old girl. Death
			<lb />
			penalty was imposed in both these cases because of the depraved
			<lb />
			nature of the crime.

			(d) (1994) 3 SCC 381, Laxman Naik v. State of Orissa : The

			appellant brutally sexually assaulted and mercilessly murdered a
			<lb />
			girl of barely 7 years. The death sentence awarded by the trial
			<lb />
			court was affirmed by the High Court. The same was upheld by
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court which noted that the appellant had diabolically
			<lb />
			conceived a plan, brutally executed it in a calculated, cold-blooded
			<lb />
			and brutal manner after rape bringing it within the rarest of the rare

			category.

			<lb />
			to his sinister design of brutal rape and gruesome murder as
			<lb />
			testified by the numerous injuries on her dead body which was
			<lb />
			dumped in a well. The sentence of death by the trial judge for
			<lb />
			commission of offences under Sections 363, 376, 302 and 201 IPC
			<lb />
			was affirmed by the High Court as well as Supreme Court holding
			<lb />
			that the -such barbaric treatment by a person who was in a
			<lb />
			position of her trust his culpability assumes the proportion of
			<lb />
			extreme depravity and arouses a sense of revulsion in the mind of
			<lb />
			the common man‖.
			<lb />
			The motivation of a perpetrator, the
			<lb />
			vulnerability of the victim, the enormity of the crime, the execution

			<lb />
			diabolic, especially since women and children had also been shot.

			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(a) (2011) 3 SCC 85, B.A. Umesh v. Registrar General, High
			<lb />
			Court of Karnataka : The appellant had a prior conviction for
			<lb />
			robbery, dacoity and rape which was the primary factor that led to
			<lb />
			the court imposing death sentence on the appellant. Extreme
			<lb />
			depravity, the manner in which the crime was committed and the
			<lb />
			fact that the appellant had raped and murdered a helpless woman
			<lb />
			also influenced the court decision. The court also considered the
			<lb />
			unproven fact that the appellant had attempted to rape another
			<lb />
			woman subsequent to the incident and that he had committed
			<lb />
			various other robberies.
			<lb />

			(C) PRE-MEDITATED ACTS
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(a) MANU/SC/0105/2013, Sunder v. State (by Inspector of
			<lb />
			Police) : The appellant kidnapped a seven year old boy with whom
			<lb />
			he was acquainted and murdered him as a result of failure of his
			<lb />
			parents to pay the demanded ransom. Death sentence was imposed
			<lb />
			on the ground that this was a pre-meditated crime and that the
			<lb />
			actions of the appellant exhibited utter disregard for human life.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) (2010) 3 SCC 56, Vikram Singh v. State of Punjab : The
			<lb />
			appellant murdered the victim, a 16 year old boy, known to him for
			<lb />
			failure of his relatives to pay ransom. Death sentence was
			<lb />
			imposed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(c) (2012) 4 SCC 97, Sonu Sardar v. State of Chhattisgarh :
			<lb />
			The appellant murdered five members of a family including two
			<lb />
			children, aged 7 and 9, using an axe and iron rod. The court held
			<lb />
			that though the appellant was young, he was beyond reform and
			<lb />
			therefore, sentenced him to death.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(D) CASES BASED ON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) (2008) 15 SCC 269, Shivaji v. State of Maharashtra : In
			<lb />
			para 27 of this judgment, the Supreme Court held that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;27. The plea that in a case of circumstantial evidence
			<lb />
			death should not be awarded is without any logic. If the
			<lb />
			circumstantial evidence is found to be of unimpeachable
			<lb />
			character in establishing the guilt of the accused, that
			<lb />
			forms the foundation for conviction. That has nothing to
			<lb />
			do with the question of sentence as has been observed by
			<lb />
			this Court in various cases while awarding death
			<lb />
			sentence. The mitigating circumstances and the
			<lb />
			aggravating circumstances have to be balanced. In the
			<lb />
			balance sheet of such circumstances, the fact that the case
			<lb />
			rests on circumstantial evidence has no role to play. In
			<lb />
			fact in most of the cases where death sentences are
			<lb />
			awarded for rape and murder and the like, there is
			<lb />
			practically no scope for having an eyewitness. They are
			<lb />
			not committed in the public view. But the very nature of
			<lb />
			things in such cases, the available evidence is
			<lb />
			circumstantial evidence. If the said evidence has been
			<lb />
			found to be credible, cogent and trustworthy for the
			<lb />
			purpose of recording conviction, to treat that evidence
			<lb />
			as a mitigating circumstance, would amount to
			<lb />
			consideration of an irrelevant aspect. The plea of the
			<lb />
			learned amicus curiae that the conviction is based on
			<lb />
			circumstantial evidence and, therefore, the death sentence
			<lb />
			should not be awarded is clearly unsustainable.&quot;

			After considering the evidence on record, the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			awarded the death sentence to the appellant for his conviction for

			rape and murder of a nine year old child.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) (2011) 5 SCC 317, Mohd. Mannan @ Abdul Mannan v.
			<lb />
			State of Bihar : The appellant, a matured man aged 43 years, while
			<lb />
			working as a mason in the house of the victim, was convicted on
			<lb />
			the basis of circumstantial evidence for kidnapping, raping and
			<lb />
			killing a minor girl and causing disappearance of evidence of the
			<lb />
			offence. The court upheld the findings of the High Court that the
			<lb />
			case fell in the category of &quot;rarest of rare&quot; cases and confirmed the
			<lb />
			death sentence awarded to the appellant.

		</p>
		<p>
			(c) (2011) 7 SCC 125, Sudam @ Rahul Kaniram Jadhav v.
			<lb />
			State of Maharashtra : The appellant was convicted for murder by
			<lb />
			strangulation of four children and a woman with whom he lived as
			<lb />
			husband and wife based on circumstantial evidence. The death
			<lb />
			sentence handed out by the trial court and the High Court were
			<lb />
			upheld by the Supreme Court.

		<p>
			(E) TERRORIST ATTACKS
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) (2012) 9 SCC 234, Mohammed Ajmal Mohammed Amir
			<lb />
			Kasab v. State of Maharashtra : The fact that there were multiple
			<lb />
			victims and that the appellant did not repent for his actions was
			<lb />
			considered an aggravating circumstance. The court refused to
			<lb />
			consider the young age of the appellant as the mitigating
			<lb />
			circumstance as it was completely offset by absence of any
			<lb />
			remorse on his part and sentenced the appellant to death.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) (2011) 13 SCC 621, Mohd. Arif @ Ashfaq v. State of
			<lb />
			N.C.T. of Delhi : The appellant was involved in an attack on the
			<lb />
			Red Fort in Delhi which was held to be an attack on India. The act
			<lb />
			of the appellant posed a challenge to the unity, integrity and the
			<lb />
			sovereignty of the country and the soldiers were killed in this
			<lb />
			attack. He was therefore, sentenced to death.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(F) REJECTION OF YOUNG AGE AS A MITIGATING
			<lb />
			FACTOR
			<lb />
			Some cases where the court had rejected the argument that
			<lb />
			the convict was of young age which should be treated as a
			<lb />
			mitigating factor and therefore, death sentence should not be
			<lb />
			imposed are to be found prior and subsequent to 2008. The
			<lb />
			following cases have been placed before us:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) AIR 1983 SC 594, Javed Ahmed Abdulhamid v. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra wherein the appellant was aged 22 years and the case
			<lb />
			rested on circumstantial evidence. Death sentence was confirmed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) So far as the argument of learned counsels for the convicts
			<lb />
			that they were all young persons with families are concerned, we
			<lb />
			propose to refer to the observations in (1991) 3 SCC 471, Sevaka
			<lb />
			Perumal &amp; Anr. v. State of Tamil Nadu reflecting a similar plea in
			<lb />
			the following terms:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-12. xxx xxx xxx It is further contended that the
			<lb />
			appellants are young men. They are the bread winners
			<lb />
			of their family each consisting of a young wife, minor
			<lb />
			child and aged parents and that, therefore, the death
			<lb />
			sentence may be converted into life. We find no force.
			<lb />
			These compassionate grounds would always be present
			<lb />
			in most cases and are not relevant for interference.
			<lb />
			Thus we find no infirmity in the sentence awarded by
			<lb />
			the Sessions Court and confirmed by the High Court
			<lb />
			warranting interference. The appeals are accordingly
			<lb />
			dismissed.‖

			(a) (2014) SCC OnLine SC 538 : (2014) 8 SCALE 365,

			Santosh Kumar Singh v. State of Madhya Pradesh : The appellant
			<lb />
			was held guilty for offences under Sections 302, 307, 394, 397 and
			<lb />
			450 of the IPC and sentenced to death by the trial court and the
			<lb />
			High Court. The Supreme Court considered that the appellant was
			<lb />
			an educated person, about 26 years of age, at the time of
			<lb />
			committing the offence and was a tutor in the family of the
			<lb />
			deceased who was acquainted with the deceased as well as her
			<lb />
			family members. It was not the case of the prosecution that the
			<lb />
			appellant could not be reformed or that he was a social menace.
			<lb />
			The appellant had no criminal antecedents. Though he had
			<lb />
			committed a heinous crime but it could not be held with certainty
			<lb />
			that the case fell in the &quot;rarest of rare&quot; category. The death
			<lb />
			sentence was therefore, commuted to life.

			(b) (2014) 4 SCC 292, Mahesh Dhanaji Shinde v. State of

			Maharashtra : In this case, nine persons were brutally murdered.
			<lb />
			It was held by the Supreme Court that the four convicts were
			<lb />
			young in age (i.e. 23 -29 years) at the time of commission of the
			<lb />
			offence; belong to the economically, socially and educationally
			<lb />
			deprived section of the population. They were living in acute
			<lb />
			poverty which possibly led to a yearning for quick money and
			<lb />
			these circumstances had led to commission of the crimes. The
			<lb />
			court also noted their conduct in the jail when they had enrolled
			<lb />
			themselves for further education and were on the verge of
			<lb />
			acquiring the B.A. degree. Three of the appellants had participated
			<lb />
			in different programmes of Gandhi and thoughts and had been
			<lb />
			awarded certificates of such participation. One of the convicts in
			<lb />
			association with another appellant had written a book. The court
			<lb />
			noted that there was no material or information to show any
			<lb />
			condemnable or reprehensible conduct on the part of the
			<lb />
			appellants during their period of custody. It was noted that these
			<lb />
			circumstances pointed to the possibility of the appellants being
			<lb />
			reformed and living a meaningful and constructive life if they
			<lb />
			were given a second chance. It was therefore, held that the option
			<lb />
			of life sentence &quot;was not unquestionably foreclosed&quot; and the
			<lb />
			sentence of death was commuted to life imprisonment, the custody
			<lb />
			of the appellants for the rest of their lives would be subject to

			being reformed; since they were young (being between 21 to 30
			<lb />
			years old); did not have a prior criminal record; and that they could
			<lb />
			not be considered a menace to society. They were therefore,
			<lb />
			sentenced to imprisonment for life.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(g) (2012) Crl.LJ 615 (SC), Purna Chandra Kusal v. State of
			<lb />
			Orissa : The appellant, a 30 year old man, raped and murdered a
			<lb />
			five year old girl, who was his neighbour. The court recognized
			<lb />
			that the crime was heinous yet decided against imposing the death
			<lb />
			penalty. One of the cited reasons was the young age of the convict.

			(h) (2011) 2 SCC 764, Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod (2) v.
			<lb />
			State of Gujarat : In this case, the appellant aged about 27 years
			<lb />
			was the watchman of the building where the deceased, a Class IV
			<lb />
			student was residing.
			<lb />
			The appellant was found guilty of
			<lb />
			commission of offences under Sections 363, 366, 376, 302 and 397
			<lb />
			IPC and sentenced to death by the trial court which was affirmed
			<lb />
			by the High Court. A two judge bench of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			upheld the conviction but differed on the sentence to be awarded
			<lb />
			by the judgments dated 25 th February, 2009. The matter was heard
			<lb />
			by a bench of three judges wherein the court held that as the
			<lb />
			appellant was a young man of only 27 years of age, it was
			<lb />
			obligatory on the trial court to have given a finding as to a
			<lb />
			possible rehabilitation and reformation and the possibility that he
			<lb />
			could still become a useful member of the society in case he was
			<lb />
			given a chance to do so. Such finding had not been returned.
			<lb />
			The court also considered the uncertainty due to nature of the
			<lb />
			circumstantial evidence. It was also held that &quot;the gravity of the
			<lb />
			offence, the behaviour of the appellant and the fear and concern
			<lb />
			such incidents generate in ordered society, cannot be ignored&quot;.
			<lb />
			Relying on two prior pronouncements, the court substituted the
			<lb />
			death penalty with life penalty directing that &quot;the life sentence
			<lb />
			must extend to the full life of the appellant but subject to any
			<lb />
			remission or commutation at the instance of the government for
			<lb />
			good and sufficient reasons&quot;.

			(i)
			<lb />
			(2011) 3 SCC 685, Ramesh v. State of Rajasthan : The
			<lb />
			appellant committed a double murder for gain of a married couple
			<lb />
			who were moneylenders while committing robbery. Though the
			<lb />
			murder was brutal in nature, the court held the young age of the
			<lb />
			appellant as the mitigating factor and that there was nothing to
			<lb />
			indicate that he could not be reformed. The appellant was
			<lb />
			sentenced to life imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(j)
			<lb />
			(2010) 1 SCC 775, Dilip Premnarayan Tiwari v. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra : In this case, the motive for murder was the inter-
			<lb />
			caste marriage of the sister of one of the appellants despite
			<lb />
			resentment and disapproval by the girl&apos;s family. Three men
			<lb />
			including the girl&apos;s brother attacked the girl&apos;s husband and his
			<lb />
			family, killing four people including the husband. The Supreme
			<lb />
			Court considered the young age of the brother as a mitigating
			<lb />
			circumstance observing that the brother must have been upset
			<lb />
			because of his sister&apos;s decision to marry outside her caste. It
			<lb />
			sentenced the appellants to imprisonment for 25 years.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(k) (2009) 6 SCC 498, Santoshkumar Bariyar v. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra : In this case, the deceased was a friend of the
			<lb />
			appellants who was kidnapped for ransom and murdered by them
			<lb />
			after planning. Despite these factors, the court held that the death
			<lb />
			penalty was not an appropriate sentence. The young age of the
			<lb />
			appellants, the fact that they had no prior criminal history, and that
			<lb />
			they were unemployed were considered mitigating factors.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(B) POSSIBILITY OF REFORM
			<lb />
			The consideration that young age may be considered as a
			<lb />
			mitigating factor rests on the theory of rehabilitation of the
			<lb />
			criminal and that if he/she is younger, the possibility of reforming
			<lb />
			is higher. It has been repeatedly held that the possibility of
			<lb />
			reformation is a mitigating factor. In Bachan Singh, it was laid
			<lb />
			down that death penalty should only be imposed if the court
			<lb />
			reaches a conclusion that a person is beyond reform. This was a
			<lb />
			primary reason which weighed with the court in not imposing the
			<lb />
			death penalty on offenders despite brutality in commission of the
			<lb />
			crimes in the following cases:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) (2014) 4 SCC 747 : 2014 (3) SCALE 344, Ashok Debbarma
			<lb />
			v. State of Tripura : The court observed that the appellant was a
			<lb />
			tribal, stated to be a member of an extremist group raging war
			<lb />
			against the minority settlers, apprehending perhaps they might
			<lb />
			snatch away their livelihood and encroach upon their property,
			<lb />
			possibly such frustration and neglect might have led them to take
			<lb />
			arms, thinking they are being marginalized and ignored by the
			<lb />
			society. Viewed from this perspective, it was held that this was not
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 59
			<lb />
			a &quot;rarest of rare&quot; case for awarding the death sentence. The death
			<lb />
			sentence was altered to that of imprisonment of life for a fixed term

			of imprisonment for 20 years without remission, over and above
			<lb />
			the period of imprisonment already undergone.

			Delhi) : The appellant was convicted for murder of two children
			<lb />
			aged 4½ years and 8 months, who were related to him, who offered
			<lb />
			no provocation or resistance to the appellant&apos;s brutal act in a brutal
			<lb />
			and barbaric manner. Motivation for the crime was the refusal by
			<lb />
			their father to lend more money to the appellant. The court held
			<lb />
			that the brutal and inhuman manner of committing the murder
			<lb />
			alone could not justify the death sentence and that the court&apos;s
			<lb />
			consideration should not be confined to principally or mere
			<lb />
			circumstances connected with a particular crime but should also
			<lb />
			considered the circumstances of the criminal. In the absence of
			<lb />
			any evidence to show that the appellant was a continuing threat to
			<lb />
			society and was beyond reform and rehabilitation, the death
			<lb />
			sentence imposed by the Sessions Judge, affirmed by the High

			<lb />
			identified several mitigating factors including the unemployment of
			<lb />
			the appellant; indebted and socio economic status, his own attempt
			<lb />
			to commit suicide after murder and the motive to eliminate the
			<lb />
			family to rid them of misery. Noting that he did not have prior

			Case of circumstantial evidence including recovery of belongings

			of the deceased from possession of the accused persons on
			<lb />
			disclosure statements made by them. Amongst other mitigating
			<lb />
			circumstances, the Supreme Court noted that there was nothing on
			<lb />
			record to show as to which out of the three appellants
			<lb />
			strangulated which of the two deceased. The court proceeded
			<lb />
			with the exercise of balancing the aggravating and mitigating
			<lb />
			circumstances and imposed a sentence of imprisonment on the

			appellants.

		<item>
			(b) (2007) 11 SCC 467, Bishnu Prasad Sinha v. State of
			<lb />
			Assam: The appellants were charged and convicted for rape and
			<lb />
			murder of a 7 -8 year old girl. The court held that it must be borne
			<lb />
			in mind that the appellants had been convicted only on the basis of
			<lb />
			circumstantial evidence and that there were authorities for the
			<lb />
			proposition that if the evidence is proved by circumstantial
			<lb />
			evidence, ordinarily death penalty would not be awarded. The
			<lb />
			court also noted the circumstance that the appellant no.1 had shown
			<lb />
			his remorse and repentance even in his statement under Section
			<lb />
			313 of the Cr.P.C. and that he had accepted his guilt before the
			<lb />
			Judicial Magistrate. The appellants were sentenced to undergo
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life.

		</item>
		<item>
			(c) (2014) 5 SCC 509, Dharam Deo Yadav v. State of Uttar
			<lb />
			Pradesh : The appellant, a tourist guide, was convicted of murder
			<lb />
			by strangulation of a young tourist of a foreign country. In para 36
			<lb />
			of the pronouncement, reliance was placed on the precedent in
			<lb />
			Shankar Kisanrao Khade. It was pressed on behalf of the convict
			<lb />
			that though both the crime and criminal test were against the
			<lb />
			accused, however, he had no previous criminal record and that
			<lb />
			apart from the circumstantial evidence, there was no eye-witness
			<lb />
			and consequently the manner in which the crime was committed
			<lb />
			was not in evidence. The court accepted the submission that
			<lb />
			therefore, it would not be possible for the court to come to the
			<lb />
			conclusion that the crime was committed in a barbaric manner. It
			<lb />
			was therefore, held that it would not fall under the category of
			<lb />
			&quot;rarest of rare&quot;. The death sentence of the appellant was
			<lb />
			commuted to life and the court awarded 20 years of rigorous
			<lb />
			imprisonment over and above the period already undergone by
			<lb />
			the accused without any remission to meet the ends of justice.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(D) OTHER MITIGATING FACTORS
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) (2013) 3 SCC 294, Mohinder Singh v. State of Punjab :
			<lb />
			When the appellant was out on payroll in a prior conviction for
			<lb />
			raping his daughter, he murdered his wife and the daughter. The
			<lb />
			court ruled that revenge being the motive for the murder, rendered
			<lb />
			it insufficient to bring it within the &quot;rarest of rare&quot; case. It was
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 62
			<lb />
			further held that the appellant was not a dangerous man and sparing
			<lb />
			his life would not cause danger to the community. The fact that the
			<lb />
			appellant had spared the life of one of his other daughters who was
			<lb />
			at home at the time of the incident, was considered a mitigating
			<lb />
			factor.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) AIR 2012 SC 968, Absar Alam v. State of Bihar : The
			<lb />
			Supreme Court noted that the appellant was an illiterate, rustic man
			<lb />
			who cut off his mother&apos;s head as he believed that she was
			<lb />
			responsible for his wife&apos;s desertion. The mental condition of the
			<lb />
			appellant was held to be a relevant factor for not imposing a death
			<lb />
			sentence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(c) (2012) 4 SCC 289, Brajender Singh v. State of Madhya
			<lb />
			Pradesh : The appellant had murdered his wife and three children
			<lb />
			by cutting their throats and setting them on fire using petrol for the
			<lb />
			reason that his wife had an extra-marital relationship with a
			<lb />
			neighbour. The Supreme Court did not sentence him to death
			<lb />
			holding that the appellant appeared repentant and was suffering
			<lb />
			because he had lost his entire family; and had committed the crime
			<lb />
			at the spur of the moment. It was further held that merely because
			<lb />
			the crime is committed in a heinous matter, is not reason enough to
			<lb />
			sentence a person to death. Other factors and circumstances need
			<lb />
			to be considered.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(d) (2011) 10 SCC 389, Sham v. State of Maharashtra : The
			<lb />
			appellant was convicted of a triple murder of his brother, brother&apos;s
			<lb />
			wife and son because of a property dispute. Upon conviction, the
			<lb />
			trial court sentenced him to imprisonment for life. The High Court
			<lb />
			dismissed the appellant&apos;s appeal; allowed the State appeal and
			<lb />
			enhanced the sentence of life imprisonment to death. The Supreme
			<lb />
			Court noted that the appellant was 38 years of age; no weapon
			<lb />
			much less dangerous was used in the commission of the offence; he
			<lb />
			was 38 years of age;
		</item>
		<note type="other">
			his antecedents were unblemished; it could
			<lb />
			not be said that the appellant would be a menace to society or that
			<lb />
			he could not be reformed or rehabilitated or would constitute a
			<lb />
			continued threat to society. It was further noted that the appellant
			<lb />
			was unemployed and that he had spent 10 years in prison, out
		</note>
		<p>
			of
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 63
			<lb />
			which five were in the death cell. The court also noted that while
			<lb />
			enhancing the sentence, the High Court had not assigned adequate
			<lb />
			and acceptable reasons while the trial court had opportunity of
			<lb />
			noting the demeanour of witnesses as well as the accused. The
			<lb />
			court therefore, restored the sentence imposed by the trial court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(e) (1999) 6 SCC 60, Akhtar v. State of U.P. : The appellant
			<lb />
			was found guilty of murder of a young girl after raping and
			<lb />
			sentenced to death by the Sessions Judge which was confirmed by
			<lb />
			the High Court. The two Judge Bench of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			(Laxman Naik and Kamta Tiwari) was of the view that the
			<lb />
			appellant did not intentionally commit the murder of the girl and
			<lb />
			that there was no premeditation. On the other hand, he found her
			<lb />
			alone in a lonely place and picked her up for committing rape.
			<lb />
			While committing rape, by way of gagging, she had died on
			<lb />
			account of asphyxia. It was held that this was not one of the -rarest
			<lb />
			of rare‖ cases inviting death penalty.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(E) AGGRAVATING FACTORS NEGATIVED
			<lb />
			Several precedents have been placed before us wherein
			<lb />
			though aggravating factors were present, the court did not sentence
			<lb />
			the offender to death. Instead the court opted to impose
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life. We enumerate some of these cases
			<lb />
			hereafter:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(a) (2013) 2 SCC 452 : (2012) 11 SCALE 140, Sangeet &amp; Anr.
			<lb />
			v. State of Haryana : Despite the murder of four people (including
			<lb />
			two women and a four year old child), the court did not impose the
			<lb />
			death penalty on the ground that there was uncertainty created by
			<lb />
			the court&apos;s own jurisprudence as to whether the death penalty
			<lb />
			should be imposed or whether a person convicted for murder
			<lb />
			should be sentenced to imprisonment for life.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(b) (2009) 14 SCC 31, State of Punjab v. Manjit Singh :
			<lb />
			Although the Supreme Court held that the murder of four people
			<lb />
			while they were sleeping by the appellant had been committed in a
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 64
			<lb />
			cruel and barbaric manner, other circumstances could not be lost
			<lb />
			sight of and the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for life.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(c) (2009)15 SCC 51, Haru Ghosh v. State of West Bengal :
			<lb />
			The offence of murder of two people (a woman aged and her 12
			<lb />
			year old son) as well as an attempt to murder of a sixty year old
			<lb />
			man was committed by the appellant when he was in fact serving
			<lb />
			out a sentence in another case and had been released on bail. It
			<lb />
			was held by the Supreme Court that this was not a &quot;rarest of rare&quot;
			<lb />
			case and that although the murder had been committed in a brutal
			<lb />
			manner, that was not sufficient to impose the death penalty. The
			<lb />
			court noted that the appellant had not come prepared with a
			<lb />
			weapon to commit the murder and that the reason for the offence
			<lb />
			was bitterness towards the woman and her husband. The appellant
			<lb />
			was sentenced to imprisonment for 30 years.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(d) (2008) 16 SCC 372, Aqeel Ahmad v. State of Uttar
			<lb />
			Pradesh: It was held by the Supreme Court that the number of
			<lb />
			victims is not the determinative factor in imposing the death
			<lb />
			penalty. Though two persons had been shot to death, it was held
			<lb />
			that this was not a &quot;rarest of rare&quot; case and the appellant was
			<lb />
			sentenced to imprisonment for life.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(e) (2012) 6 SCC 107, Sandeep v. State of Uttar Pradesh : The
			<lb />
			Supreme Court held
		</item>
		<note type="other">
			that the &quot;rarest of rare&quot; case formulation
			<lb />
			applies when the accused is a menace to society, and would
			<lb />
			threaten its peaceful and harmonious coexistence. It rules that a
			<lb />
			crime may be heinous or brutal, but that in itself is not sufficient to
			<lb />
			make the case a &quot;rarest of rare&quot; one. Although the court imposed a
			<lb />
			life sentence, it held that the death sentence may be justified in
			<lb />
			cases where murder is committed in a grotesque, diabolical and
			<lb />
			revolting manner.

		</note>
		<p>
			(f)
			<lb />
			(2011) 7 SCC 437, State of Maharashtra v. Goraksha
			<lb />
			Ambajai Adsul : The Supreme Court opined that lust for property
			<lb />
			had driven the respondent to committing the offence. It was held
			<lb />
			that although crime was committed in a brutal manner, other
			<lb />
			circumstances need to be considered as well and that constant
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

			<lb />
			nagging by the deceased persons (his father, step mother and step
			<lb />
			sister) was a mitigating factor.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(g) AIR 1998 SC 2726, Panchhi v. State of U.P. : It was held
			<lb />
			that brutality of the manner in which a murder was perpetrated may
			<lb />
			be a ground but not the sole criteria for judging whether the case is
			<lb />
			one of the &quot;rarest of rare&quot; cases as indicated in Bachan Singh&apos;s
			<lb />
			case that in a way every murder is brutal and the difference
			<lb />
			between one from the other may be on account of mitigating or
			<lb />
			aggravating features surrounding the murder. In this case, four
			<lb />
			persons including a child were murdered due to rivalry between
			<lb />
			families.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(h) We now note two cases of rape and murder that came up
			<lb />
			before the Supreme Court where the court sentenced the offender
			<lb />
			to imprisonment for life. In (2012) 5 SCC 766, Neel Kumar v.
			<lb />
			State of Haryana, the appellant was convicted for the rape and
			<lb />
			murder of his four year old daughter. Holding that this was not a
			<lb />
			&quot;rarest of rare&quot; case, the Supreme Court sentenced the appellant to
			<lb />
			imprisonment for a period of 30 years, instructing the State not to
			<lb />
			provide the option of remission till that time.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The second case is reported at (2010) 1 SCC 58, Sebastian
			<lb />
			@ Chevithiyan v. State of Kerala wherein the appellant had raped
			<lb />
			and murdered a two year old child after kidnapping her from her
			<lb />
			house. The appellant was 24 years old at that time. It was again
			<lb />
			held that this was not a &quot;rarest of rare&quot; case and the appellant was
			<lb />
			sentenced to imprisonment for the rest of his life.

			accused who was convicted and awarded the death sentence. The
			<lb />
			High Court set aside the conviction. On scrutiny, the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court illustrated the conviction observing that -we would have
			<lb />
			concurred with the Sessions Court&apos;s view that the extreme penalty
			<lb />
			of death can be chosen for such a crime‖. It was further held that
			<lb />
			in spite of the fact that the case was -perilously near the region of
			<lb />
			rarest of the rare cases‖, the Supreme Court was refraining from
			<lb />
			imposing the extreme penalty once the accused was stood acquitted
			<lb />
			by the High Court. Placing reliance on Bachan Singh, it was
			<lb />
			observed that the lesser option was not unquestionably foreclosed
			<lb />
			and so the sentence was -altered‖ in regard to the offence under
			<lb />
			Section 302 to imprisonment for life.

			The accused was guilty of rape and murder of a helpless young

			pregnant housewife who was sleeping in her own apartment with
			<lb />
			her little baby by her side during the absence of her husband. The
			<lb />
			High Court upset the conviction and death sentence awarded by the
			<lb />
			trial court. The Supreme Court was of the view that the High
			<lb />
			Court had erred, restored the conviction but -at this distance of
			<lb />
			time‖ was not inclined to restore the sentence of death.

			(F) PRIOR CRIMINAL HISTORY
			<lb />
			In (2014) 3 SCC 421 : 2014 (2) SCALE 293, Birju v. State
			<lb />
			of M.P., the court held that the accused had only been charge-
			<lb />
			sheeted in earlier cases but not convicted. Hence, that factor is not
			<lb />
			a relevant factor to be taken note of while applying the R-R test so
			<lb />
			as to award capital punishment. Maybe, in a given case, the
			<lb />
			pendency of large number of criminal cases against the accused
			<lb />
			person might be a factor which could be taken note of in
			<lb />
			awarding a sentence but, in any case, not a relevant factor for
			<lb />
			awarding capital punishment. It was further observed that there
			<lb />
			were more than two dozen cases, of which three relate to the
			<lb />
			offence of murder, the usual plea of false implication by the
			<lb />
			defence has to be put on the back seat, and may have an impact on
			<lb />
			the sentencing policy, since the presence of the accused could be a
			<lb />
			continuing threat to the society and hence calls for longer period of
			<lb />
			incarceration.

			76. In Swamy Shraddananda (2), the Supreme Court had
			<lb />
			pointed out that there was a small band of cases where the
			<lb />
			convicted person is sentenced to death by the Supreme Court,
			<lb />
			However, there was a wide range of cases where the offender was
			<lb />
			sentenced to imprisonment for life where the facts were similar or
			<lb />
			more revolting, relative to the cases where the death sentence was
			<lb />
			imposed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			77. The Supreme Court has therefore, noted and highlighted the
			<lb />
			inconsistency and arbitrariness in the death penalty jurisprudence.
			<lb />
			It was observed that different criteria had been utilized by different
			<lb />
			Benches of the court in determining whether the case before them
			<lb />
			fell within the -rarest of rare‖ category and that a consistent and
			<lb />
			clear sentencing policy had not been evolved by it. Thus the
			<lb />
			inconsistency in sentencing received a recognition in the judicial
			<lb />
			pronouncements.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			78. The precedents of the Supreme Court indicate the change in
			<lb />
			the trend for evaluation of circumstances pointed out in Bachan
			<lb />
			Singh. While the Supreme Court has observed the lack of
			<lb />
			evenness in the sentencing policy and its application in Swamy
			<lb />
			Shraddananda (2), in Bariyar, the court expressed -unease and
			<lb />
			sense of disquiet‖ with regard to the varied and inconsistent
			<lb />
			application of the rarest of rare case threshold.

			<lb />
			Court has applied the &quot;doctrine of proportionality&quot; directing as
			<lb />
			follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;23. The survival of an orderly society demands the
			<lb />
			extinction of the life of a person who is proved to be a
			<lb />
			menace to social order and security. Thus, the courts for
			<lb />
			the purpose of deciding just and appropriate sentence to
			<lb />
			be awarded for an offence, have to delicately balance the
			<lb />
			aggravating and mitigating factors and circumstances
			<lb />
			in which a crime has been committed, in a dispassionate
			<lb />
			manner. In the absence of any foolproof formula which
			<lb />
			may provide a basis for reasonable criteria to correctly
			<lb />
			assess various circumstances germane for the
			<lb />
			consideration of the gravity of the crime, discretionary
			<lb />
			judgment, in relation to the facts of each case, is the only
			<lb />
			way in which such judgment may be equitably
			<lb />
			distinguished. The Court has primarily dissected the
			<lb />
			principles into two different compartments-one being
			<lb />
			the -aggravating circumstances‖ and, the other being the
			<lb />
			-mitigating circumstance‖. To balance the two is the
			<lb />
			primary duty of the court. The principle of
			<lb />
			proportionality between the crime and the punishment is
			<lb />
			the principle of -just deserts‖ that serves as the
			<lb />
			foundation of every criminal sentence that is justifiable.
			<lb />
			In other words, the -doctrine of proportionality‖ has
			<lb />
			valuable application to the sentencing policy under the
			<lb />
			Indian criminal jurisprudence. While determining the
			<lb />
			quantum of punishment the court always records
			<lb />
			sufficient reasons. (Vide Sevaka Perumal v. State of

		<p>
			80. The aforesaid enumeration of cases would show that apart
			<lb />
			from death sentence, while imposing life sentence the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court, has been directing mandatory minimum term of sentence
			<lb />
			before which the executive would exercise the power of remission
			<lb />
			of sentences. Several instances in cases involving convictions for
			<lb />
			multiple offences have been noted above wherein the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court has directed that the sentences for different offences would
			<lb />
			run consecutively. In view of the challenge to the permissibility of
			<lb />
			such an option being available to this court, in the present case, we
			<lb />
			propose to take these three options in seriatum hereafter.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			III. Life imprisonment -meaning and nature of
			<lb />
			81. So far as sentencing is concerned, Section 302 of the IPC
			<lb />
			mandates imposition of imprisonment for life or the death
			<lb />
			sentence, with fine. What is the meaning and nature of a life
			<lb />
			sentence?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			82. We have noted above Section 53 of the Indian Penal Code
			<lb />
			defining the punishments under the Code, which include (i) death;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii) imprisonment for life; (iii) imprisonment which is of two
			<lb />
			descriptions namely, rigorous i.e. with hard labour, and simple; (iv)
			<lb />
			forfeiture of property and; (v) fine.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 74
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			83. Section 45, the Indian Penal Code defines ‗life&apos; as the life of
			<lb />
			the human being unless a contrary intention appears from the
			<lb />
			context.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			84. ‗Imprisonment&apos; is not defined under the Indian Penal Code.
			<lb />
			However, Section 3(27) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 states
			<lb />
			that ‗imprisonment&quot; shall mean imprisonment of either description
			<lb />
			as defined in the Indian Penal Code.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			85. In para 5 of the judgment of the Constitution Bench reported
			<lb />
			at AIR 1961 SC 600 : (1961) 3 SCR 440, Gopal Vinayak Godse v.
			<lb />
			State of Maharashtra, following the decision of the Privy Council
			<lb />
			reported at AIR 1945 PC 64, Pandit Kishori Lal v. King Emperor,
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court observed as follows :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-4. xxx xxx xxx
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			5.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			... A sentence of transportation for life or
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life must prima facie be treated
			<lb />
			as transportation or imprisonment for the whole
			<lb />
			of the remaining period of the convicted person&apos;s
			<lb />
			natural life.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(Underlining by us)
			<lb />

		<p>
			86. This position was followed by the Supreme Court in AIR
			<lb />
			2005 SC 3440, Md. Munna v. Union of India. It was also
			<lb />
			reiterated by the Supreme Court in para 67 of Swamy
			<lb />
			Shraddananda (2) wherein it was observed thus:-
			<lb />
			-67. On a perusal of the seven decisions discussed
			<lb />
			above and the decisions referred to therein it would
			<lb />
			appear that this Court modified the death sentence to
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life or in some cases imprisonment for
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 75
			<lb />
			a term of twenty years with the further direction that the
			<lb />
			convict must not be released from prison for the rest of
			<lb />
			his life or before actually serving out the term of twenty
			<lb />
			years, as the case may be, mainly on two premises; one,
			<lb />
			an imprisonment for life, in terms of Section 53 read
			<lb />
			with Section 45 of the Penal Code meant imprisonment
			<lb />
			for the rest of life of the prisoner and two, a convict
			<lb />
			undergoing life imprisonment has no right to claim
			<lb />
			remission. In support of the second premise reliance is
			<lb />
			placed on the line of decisions beginning from Gopal
			<lb />
			Vinayak Godse v. State of Maharashtra [AIR 1961 SC
			<lb />
			600 : (1961) 3 SCR 440] and coming down to Mohd.
			<lb />
			Munna v. Union of India [(2005) 7 SCC 417 : 2005
			<lb />
			SCC (Cri) 1688] .
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			76. It is equally well settled that Section 57 of the
			<lb />
			Penal Code does not in any way limit the punishment of
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life to a term of twenty years. Section
			<lb />
			57 is only for calculating fractions of terms of
			<lb />
			punishment and provides that imprisonment for life
			<lb />
			shall be reckoned as equivalent to imprisonment for
			<lb />
			twenty years. (See Gopal Vinayak Godse [AIR 1961 SC
			<lb />
			600 : (1961) 3 SCR 440] and Ashok Kumar [(1991) 3
			<lb />
			SCC 498 : 1991 SCC (Cri) 845] .) The object and
			<lb />
			purpose of Section 57 will be clear by simply referring
			<lb />
			to Sections 65, 116, 119, 129 and 511 of the Penal
			<lb />
			Code.

			(Underlining by us)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			87. Apart from the above, the Supreme Court has reiterated the
			<lb />
			position by a catena of decisions that the punishment of
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life handed down by the courts means a sentence
			<lb />
			of imprisonment for the convict for the remainder of his life. (Ref:

			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			88. In para 75 of Swamy Shraddananda (2) also, it was settled
			<lb />
			that awarding a life sentence means life and not a murderer&apos;s 14
			<lb />
			years in jail.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			89. We find that even in the Constitution Bench pronouncement
			<lb />
			decided on 2 nd September, 2014 in W.P.(Crl.)No.77/2014, Mohd.
			<lb />
			Arif @ Ashfaq v. The Registrar, Supreme Court of India &amp; Ors.,
			<lb />
			it was observed that spending 13½ years in jail (he was arrested on
			<lb />
			25 th December, 2000; convicted by the Sessions Judge on 31 st
			<lb />
			October, 2005; appeal dismissed by the High Court on 13 th
			<lb />
			September, 2007; dismissal of appeal by the Supreme Court on 10 th
			<lb />

			<lb />
			August, 2012 and curative petition filed in 2013 which was
			<lb />
			dismissed on 23 rd January, 2014) did not mean that the petitioner
			<lb />
			had undergone a sentence for life.
			<lb />
			pg. 77
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			90. A further question which arises is as to what is the nature of
			<lb />
			imprisonment if a convict is sentenced to life imprisonment? This
			<lb />
			question has been answered by the Supreme Court in the judgment
			<lb />
			reported at AIR 1983 SC 855, Naib Singh v. State of Punjab &amp;
			<lb />
			Ors.. We find that in this case, in para 18, the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			declared the position in law as regards the nature of punishment
			<lb />
			involved in a sentence for imprisonment for life. The Court held
			<lb />
			thus :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-18. However, for the reasons discussed above and in
			<lb />
			view of the authoritative pronouncements made by the
			<lb />
			Privy Council and this Court in Kishori Lal
			<lb />
			case [Kishori Lal v. Emperor, AIR 1945 PC 64 : 72 IA 1
			<lb />

		<item>
			(1961) 3 SCR 440 : (1962) 1 SCJ 423 : (1961) 1 Cri LJ
			<lb />
			736] respectively, it will have to be held that the
			<lb />
			position in law as regards the nature of punishment
			<lb />
			involved in a sentence of imprisonment for life is well
			<lb />
			settled and the sentence of imprisonment for life has to
			<lb />
			be equated to rigorous imprisonment for life. In this
			<lb />
			view of the matter, the recommendation of the Law
			<lb />
			Commission contained in its 39th and 42nd Reports
			<lb />
			suggesting a suitable amendment in the Indian Penal
			<lb />
			Code will have to be regarded as having been made only
			<lb />
			for a purpose of removal of doubts and clarifying or
			<lb />
			declaring the existing legal position. Presumably for that

			reason the suggested amendment has not been regarded
			<lb />
			as absolutely necessary and therefore not put through so

			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012

			<lb />
			of India/Kartick Biswas v. State of West Bengal also the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court held thus :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-10. ... Imprisonment for life is a class of punishment
			<lb />
			different from ordinary imprisonment which could be of
			<lb />
			two descriptions, namely, -rigorous‖ or -simple‖. It was
			<lb />
			unnecessary for the legislature to specifically mention
			<lb />
			that the imprisonment for life would be rigorous
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life as it is imposed as punishment for
			<lb />
			grave offences.‖
			<lb />
			(Underlining by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Imprisonment for life therefore, entails rigorous
			<lb />
			imprisonment for the whole life of the convict.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			IV. Is it permissible to judicially regulate the power of the
			<lb />
			executive to remit the sentence of the defendant? In other
			<lb />
			words, can the sentencing court, while imposing a life
			<lb />
			sentence, direct minimum term sentences in excess of
			<lb />
			imprisonment of more than 14 years?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			The discussion on this subject is being considered under the
			<lb />
			following sub-headings:

		</item>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Sentencing jurisdiction of courts.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) Does a convict have an absolute right to claim remission?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii) Experience of exercise of power of remission of sentence.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iv) Submission that a fixed term for life sentence which is in
			<lb />
			excess of fourteen years imprisonment can be ordered only
			<lb />
			by the Supreme Court restricted to cases where death
			<lb />
			sentence is being commuted to life and the power of courts
			<lb />
			to curtail remission is not available to all courts.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			93. In the present cases, this court is considering the adequacy of
			<lb />
			the sentences of life imprisonment on the three defendants. The
			<lb />
			State has sought imposition of death sentences on all the
			<lb />
			defendants while the complainant seeks enhancement of the
			<lb />
			sentence on two of them to death. The question that this court is
			<lb />
			therefore, called upon to answer is as to whether the case falls in
			<lb />
			the rarest of rare category or, as noted in para 92 of Swamy
			<lb />
			Shraddananda (2) above, whether the case is an ordinary murder
			<lb />
			or the case &quot;just falls short of the rarest‖? If the case just falls short
			<lb />
			of rarest of rare category, whether imposition of the sentence of life
			<lb />
			imprisonment subjected to normal remissions etc., working out to a
			<lb />
			total term of 14 years of imprisonment, be adequate to meet the
			<lb />
			ends of justice or would it be permissible to impose a mandatory
			<lb />
			prison term sentence beyond fourteen years before an application
			<lb />
			for remission on behalf of the defendants could be considered?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			94. Mr. Sumeet Verma, learned counsel for Vikas Yadav has
			<lb />
			emphatically contended that only Supreme Court has the power to
			<lb />
			impose mandatory term imprisonments restricted to those cases
			<lb />
			where the court is commuting a death sentence to life. Mr. Verma
			<lb />
			emphatically argued that mandatory term sentences by the High
			<lb />
			Courts are legally impermissible, resting his submission on the
			<lb />
			pronouncements of the Supreme Court reported at (2013) 9 SCC
			<lb />
			778, Sahib Hussain @ Sahib Jain v. State of Rajasthan and
			<lb />
			(2013) 10 SCC 631 (2013) : 10 SCALE 671 (D.O.D. 26 th August,

			<lb />
			Mr. Verma presses an absolute right of a defendant to seek and
			<lb />
			secure remission after undergoing the statutory minimum period of
			<lb />
			imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			95. Contesting the position, Mr. Rajesh Mahajan, learned
			<lb />
			Additional Standing Counsel for the State has also placed before
			<lb />
			this Court the decision dated 17 th April, 2014 in Death Sentence
			<lb />
			Ref.No.5/2012, State v. Om Prakash whereby the Division Bench
			<lb />
			of this court did not confirm the death sentence. Instead after
			<lb />
			considering the entire jurisprudence on award of term sentence, the
			<lb />
			court was of the considered opinion that the ends of justice would
			<lb />
			be met if two of the convicted appellants were awarded a sentence
			<lb />
			of imprisonment for life which would not be less than 20 years
			<lb />
			actual. The third appellant being a young man who was not
			<lb />
			married, was awarded a sentence of imprisonment of life subject to
			<lb />
			remissions as available.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			96. Mr. Mahajan has also pointed out that in Death Sentence
			<lb />
			Ref.No.4/2013, State v. Surender &amp; Kalwa decided on 23 rd July,
			<lb />
			2014 and Death Sentence Ref.No.7/2013, State v. Bharat Kumar
			<lb />
			decided on 18 th September, 2014, this court has awarded
			<lb />
			imprisonment of 25 years without remission to the convicts.
			<lb />
			Mr. Sumeet Verma, learned counsel for Vikas Yadav would
			<lb />
			however submit that in this case also death sentence awarded by
			<lb />
			the Trial Court was up for confirmation in High Court and it was
			<lb />
			only in exercise of its power to commute the sentence, the fixed
			<lb />
			term sentence was imposed.

			<lb />
			of punishment without changing its character (say the term of
			<lb />
			imprisonment awarded or the amount of fine imposed). The court
			<lb />
			has also the power to reduce the sentence which is known as
			<lb />
			commutation and means alteration of sentence of one kind into a

			sentence of less severe kind. For instance, a death sentence is

			commuted to a life imprisonment.

		<p>
			99. While undergoing imprisonment, for their good conduct or
			<lb />
			for doing certain specified duties, etc., under the Prison Acts and
			<lb />
			the Rules framed thereunder, prisoners are given prescribed
			<lb />
			sentence remission on monthly, quarterly or annual basis. The
			<lb />
			days of remissions earned are added to the period of the actual
			<lb />
			imprisonment while calculating the term of the sentence undergone
			<lb />
			by the prisoner.

			100. Let us now examine the executive power to grant remission
			<lb />
			of the sentence and statutory restriction thereon. Sections 432 and
			<lb />
			433 of the Cr.P.C. as well as Section 55 of the Indian Penal Code
			<lb />
			are relevant in this behalf. Section 432 of the Cr.P.C. deals with
			<lb />
			the power of the appropriate government to suspend or remit
			<lb />
			sentences; while Section 433 is concerned with the power to
			<lb />
			commute sentences. We set down hereunder Sections 432 and 433
			<lb />
			of the Cr.P.C. which are as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;432. Power to suspend or remit sentences.-
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(1) When any person has been sentenced to punishment
			<lb />
			for an offence, the appropriate Government may, at any
			<lb />
			time, without Conditions or upon any conditions which
			<lb />
			the person sentenced accepts, suspend the execution of
			<lb />
			his sentence or remit the whole or any part of the
			<lb />
			punishment to which he has been sentenced.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2) Whenever an application is made to the appropriate
			<lb />
			Government for the suspension or remission of a
			<lb />
			sentence, the appropriate Government may require the
			<lb />
			presiding Judge of the Court before or by which the
			<lb />
			conviction was had or confirmed, to state his opinion as
			<lb />
			to whether the application should be granted or refused,
			<lb />
			together with his reasons for such opinion and also to
			<lb />
			forward with the statement of such opinion a certified
			<lb />
			copy of the record of the trial or of such record thereof
			<lb />
			as exists.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(3) If any condition on which a sentence has been
			<lb />
			suspended or remitted is, In the opinion of the
			<lb />
			appropriate Government, not fulfilled, the appropriate
			<lb />
			Government may cancel the suspension or remission,
			<lb />
			and thereupon the person in whose favour the sentence
			<lb />
			has been suspended or remitted may, if at large, be
			<lb />
			arrested by any police officer, without warrant and
			<lb />
			remanded to undergo the unexpired portion of the
			<lb />
			sentence.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(4) The condition on which a sentence is suspended or
			<lb />
			remitted under this section may be one to be fulfilled by
			<lb />
			the person in whose favour the sentence is suspended or
			<lb />
			remitted, or one independent of his will.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(5) The appropriate Government may, by general rules
			<lb />
			or special orders give directions as to the suspension of
			<lb />
			sentences and the conditions on which petitions should
			<lb />
			be presented and dealt with: Provided that in the case of
			<lb />
			any sentence (other than a sentence of fine) passed on a
			<lb />
			male person above the age of eighteen years, no such
			<lb />
			petition by the person sentenced or by any other person
			<lb />
			on his behalf shall be entertained, unless the person
			<lb />
			sentenced is in jail, and-
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(a) where such petition is made by the person
			<lb />
			sentenced, it is presented through the officer in
			<lb />
			charge of the jail; or
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(b) where such petition is made by any other
			<lb />
			person, it contains a declaration that the person
			<lb />
			sentenced is in jail.

			<lb />
			pg. 86
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(6) The provisions of the above sub-sections shall also
			<lb />
			apply to any order passed by a Criminal Court under
			<lb />
			any section of this Code or of any other law which
			<lb />
			restricts the liberty of any person or imposes any
			<lb />
			liability upon him or his property.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(7) In this section and in section 433, the expression&quot;
			<lb />
			appropriate Government&quot; means,-
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(a) in cases where the sentence is for an offence
			<lb />
			against, or the order referred to in sub-section (6)
			<lb />
			is passed under, any law relating to a matter to
			<lb />
			which the executive power of the Union extends,
			<lb />
			the Central Government;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(b) in other cases, the Government of the State
			<lb />
			within which the offender is sentenced or the said
			<lb />
			order is passed.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			433. Power to commute sentence.-The appropriate
			<lb />
			Government may, without the consent of the person
			<lb />
			sentenced, commute-
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(a) a sentence of death, for any other punishment
			<lb />
			provided by the Indian Penal Code;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(b) a sentence of imprisonment for life, for
			<lb />
			imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years or
			<lb />
			for fine;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(c) a sentence of rigorous imprisonment, for simple
			<lb />
			imprisonment for any term to which that person might
			<lb />
			have been sentenced, or for fine;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(d) a sentence of simple imprisonment, for fine.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			101. As noted above, Section 53 of the IPC enumerates
			<lb />
			punishments which can be imposed, the first of these being death
			<lb />
			and, the second, imprisonment for life. Sections 54 and 55 give the
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 87
			<lb />
			power of commutation of sentence of death and the sentence of
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life respectively to the appropriate government.
			<lb />
			Section 55A defines the ‗appropriate government&apos;. Section 57
			<lb />
			provides that in calculating fractions of terms of punishment,
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life shall be reckoned as equivalent to
			<lb />
			imprisonment for 20 years.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			102. In addition to the above statutory power of remission and
			<lb />
			commutation of sentences, Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution
			<lb />
			of India deal with the clemency power of the President and the
			<lb />
			Governor respectively to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or
			<lb />
			remission of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the
			<lb />
			sentence of any person convicted of any offence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			103. In (1973) 1 SCC 20, Jagmohan Singh v. State of U.P., the
			<lb />
			Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court commenting on whether
			<lb />
			the death penalty deserved to be abolished, had inter alia made the
			<lb />
			following observations with regard to life imprisonment because of
			<lb />
			the exercise of power of remission:
			<lb />
			-
		</p>
		<item>
			14. xxx xxx xxx In the context of our Criminal Law which
			<lb />
			punishes murder, one cannot ignore the fact that life
			<lb />
			imprisonment works out in most cases to a dozen years of
			<lb />
			imprisonment and it may be seriously questioned whether
			<lb />
			that sole alternative will be an adequate substitute for the
			<lb />
			death penalty. We have not been referred to any large-scale
			<lb />
			studies of crime statistics compiled in this country with the
			<lb />
			object of estimating the need of protection of the society
			<lb />
			against murders. xxx xxx xxx‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			104. Five years after the pronouncement of Jagmohan Singh,
			<lb />
			Section 433A was inserted by the amendment Act of 1978 with
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 88
			<lb />
			effect from 18 th December, 1978, imposing a restriction on the
			<lb />
			powers of remission or commutation in certain cases. Section
			<lb />
			433A of the Cr.P.C. reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;433A. Restriction on powers of remission or
			<lb />
			Commutation in certain cases.-Notwithstanding
			<lb />
			anything contained in section 432, where a sentence of
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life is imposed on conviction of a
			<lb />
			person for an offence for which death is one of the
			<lb />
			punishments provided by law, or where a sentence of
			<lb />
			death imposed on a person has been commuted under
			<lb />
			section 433 into one of imprisonment for life, such
			<lb />
			person shall not be released from prison unless he had
			<lb />
			served at least fourteen years of imprisonment.]&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			105. What is the impact of remissions earned by a prisoner while
			<lb />
			undergoing a life sentence? In the judgment reported at AIR 1961
			<lb />
			SC 600, Gopal Vinayak Godse v. State of Maharashtra, the
			<lb />
			Constitution Bench was seized of a habeas corpus petition by the
			<lb />
			petitioner who sought his release from prison claiming that he had
			<lb />
			justly served his sentence. In para 5, it was held that there was no
			<lb />
			provision of law whereunder a sentence for life imprisonment
			<lb />
			without any formal remission by the appropriate government, can
			<lb />
			be automatically treated as one for a definite period. A sentence of
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life must prima facie be treated as imprisonment
			<lb />
			for the whole of remaining period of convict&apos;s natural life. It has
			<lb />
			been further held in para 8 that unless that the sentence of life
			<lb />
			imprisonment is commuted or remitted by the appropriate
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 89
			<lb />
			authority, a prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment is bound in law
			<lb />
			to serve the life term in prison.
			<lb />
			Therefore, it is well settled that life imprisonment means that
			<lb />
			the prisoner will remain in prison for the rest of his life. It is only
			<lb />
			if imprisonment is for a definite period, that credit for remission
			<lb />
			given or awarded has a meaning. Since life imprisonment is for an
			<lb />
			indefinite period, remissions earned or awarded are really
			<lb />
			theoretical.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			106. The above view in Constitution Bench pronouncement in
			<lb />
			Gopal Vinayak Godse was reiterated in the judgment reported at
			<lb />
			(1981) 1 SCC 107, Maru Ram v. Union of India. In para 25 of
			<lb />
			Maru Ram, it was observed as follows:
			<lb />
			-25. ... The nature of a life sentence is incarceration
			<lb />
			until death, judicial sentence of imprisonment for life
			<lb />
			cannot be in jeopardy merely because of long
			<lb />
			accumulation of remissions. ...‖
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii) Does a convict have an absolute right to claim remission?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			107. Before proceeding to deal with the argument raised, it is
			<lb />
			necessary to consider whether a convict has an absolute right to
			<lb />
			claim remission. This issue has been answered by the courts when
			<lb />
			convicts pressed for entitlement to remission upon expiry of the
			<lb />
			period of 14 years or 20 years of imprisonment before the courts.
			<lb />
			Reference can usefully be made to the pronouncement of the
			<lb />
			Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in AIR (32) 1945 PC 64,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 90
			<lb />
			Kishori Lal v. King Emperor wherein the Privy Council observed
			<lb />
			as follows :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-16. xxx xxx xxx
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-Assuming that the sentence is to be regarded as
			<lb />
			one of 20 years, and subject to remission for good
			<lb />
			conduct, he had not earned remission sufficient to entitle
			<lb />
			him to discharge at the time of his application and it was
			<lb />
			therefore rightly dismissed but, in saying this, their
			<lb />
			Lordships are not to be taken as meaning that a life
			<lb />
			sentence must and in all cases be treated as one of not
			<lb />
			more than 20 years or that the convict is necessarily
			<lb />
			entitled to remission.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			108. This judgment was cited with approval by the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in the judgment reported at (2005) 7 SCC 417, Md. Munna
			<lb />
			v. Union of India/Kartick Biswas v. State of West Bengal.
			<lb />
			It is therefore, well settled that a convict is not as of right
			<lb />
			entitled to remission of the sentence. A convict is therefore, only
			<lb />
			entitled to a non-arbitrary consideration of his application for
			<lb />
			remission based on all relevant concerns.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			109. It is equally well settled that the exercise of the power of
			<lb />
			remission has to be by a decision which is fair to all concerned,
			<lb />
			well informed and reasonable, that it cannot be exercised arbitrarily
			<lb />
			(Ref : (2013) 2 SCC 452 : (2012) 11 SCALE 140, Sangeet &amp;
			<lb />
			Anr. v. State of Haryana and (2000) 3 SCC 394, State of Haryana
			<lb />
			v. Mohinder Singh).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			110. In Sangeet, the court extensively examined the powers of the
			<lb />
			government under Section 432 of the Cr.P.C. and in para 63
			<lb />
			observed that exercise of such power by the appropriate
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 91
			<lb />
			government under Section 432(1) -cannot be suo motu for the
			<lb />
			simple reason that this sub-section is only an enabling provision‖.
			<lb />
			The section is set into motion only on receipt of an application for
			<lb />
			remission by the convict or on his behalf. Each release requires a
			<lb />
			case by case scrutiny. In paras 65 and 66 of Sangeet, the court
			<lb />
			dealt with the substantive check on arbitrary remissions by virtue
			<lb />
			of Section 433A of the Cr.P.C. which mandated the requirement of
			<lb />
			a minimum 14 years incarceration relaxable only in exercise of the
			<lb />
			constitutional power under Article 72 or Article 161 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution and Section 433 of Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii) Experience of exercise of power of remission of sentence
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			111. The working of the power of remission is best stated by the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in (1981) 1 SCC 107, Maru Ram v. Union of
			<lb />
			India. The Court reiterated the position that a sentence for life
			<lb />
			would enure till the life time of accused as it was not possible to fix
			<lb />
			particular period of the prisoner&apos;s death and the remissions given
			<lb />
			under the rules could not be regarded as substitute for the sentence
			<lb />
			for transportation for life. It was observed that the inevitable
			<lb />
			conclusion was that Section 433A only dealt with life sentences
			<lb />
			and that remission vests no right to release when sentence is life
			<lb />
			imprisonment nor is any vested right to remission cancelled by the
			<lb />
			compulsory 14 years jail life. Since a life sentence is a sentence for
			<lb />
			life, thus the remissions lead nowhere and cannot entitle the person
			<lb />
			to release. This position was stated by the Supreme Court in para
			<lb />
			23 of the judgment reported at (1981) 1 SCC 107, Maru Ram v.
			<lb />
			Union of India wherein it was held as follows:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-23. Sentencing is a judicial function but the execution
			<lb />
			of the sentence, after the courts pronouncement, is
			<lb />
			ordinarily a matter for the executive under the
			<lb />
			Procedure Code, going by Entry 2 in List III of the
			<lb />
			Seventh Schedule. Keeping aside the constitutional
			<lb />
			powers under Articles 72 and 161 which are
			<lb />
			-untouchable‖ and -unapproachable‖ for any
			<lb />
			legislature, let us examine the law of sentencing,
			<lb />
			remission and release. Once a sentence has been
			<lb />
			imposed, the only way to terminate it before the
			<lb />
			stipulated term is by action under Sections 432/433 or
			<lb />
			Articles 72/161. And if the latter power under the
			<lb />
			Constitution is not invoked, the only source of salvation
			<lb />
			is the play of power under Sections 432 and 433(a) so
			<lb />
			far as a -lifer‖ is concerned. No release by reduction or
			<lb />
			remission of sentence is possible under the corpus juris
			<lb />
			as it stands, in any other way. The legislative power of
			<lb />
			the State under Entry 4 of List II, even if it be stretched
			<lb />
			to snapping point, can deal only with Prisons and
			<lb />
			Prisoners, never with truncation of judicial sentences.
			<lb />
			Remissions by way of reward or otherwise cannot cut
			<lb />
			down the sentence as such and cannot, let it be
			<lb />
			unmistakably understood, grant final exit passport for
			<lb />
			the prisoner except by government action under Section
			<lb />
			432(1). The topic of Prisons and Prisoners does not
			<lb />
			cover release by way of reduction of the sentence itself.
			<lb />
			That belongs to criminal procedure in Entry 2 of List III
			<lb />
			although when the sentence is for a fixed term and
			<lb />
			remission plus the period undergone equal that term the
			<lb />
			prisoner may win his freedom. Any amount of remission
			<lb />
			to result in manumission requires action under Section
			<lb />
			432(1), read with the Remission Rules. That is why
			<lb />
			Parliament, tracing the single source of remission of
			<lb />
			sentence to Section 432, blocked it by the non-obstante
			<lb />
			clause. No remission, however long, can set the
			<lb />
			prisoner free at the instance of the State, before the
			<lb />
			judicial sentence has run out, save by action under the
			<lb />
			constitutional power or under Section 432. So read,
			<lb />
			the inference is inevitable, even if the contrary
			<lb />
			argument be ingenious, that Section 433-A achieves
			<lb />
			what it wants -arrest the release of certain classes of
			<lb />
			-lifers‖ before a certain period, by blocking Section
			<lb />
			432. Articles 72 and 161 are, of course, excluded from
			<lb />
			this discussion as being beyond any legislative power
			<lb />
			to curb or confine.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			112. In para 84 of the judgment reported at (2010) 3 SCC 508,
			<lb />
			Mulla v. State of U.P., noted the discussion in (2010) 1 SCC 573
			<lb />
			Ramraj v. State of Chhatisgarh, as follows :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;84. This question came up again recently before this
			<lb />
			Court in Ramraj v. State of Chhattisgarh [(2010) 1 SCC
			<lb />
			573 : (2010) 1 SCC (Cri) 842 : (2009) 14 Scale 533]
			<lb />
			where this Court considered the variance in precedents
			<lb />
			and ruled as follows: (SCC pp. 580-81, paras 21-25)
			<lb />
			-21. What ultimately emerges from all the
			<lb />
			aforesaid decisions is that life imprisonment is not
			<lb />
			to be interpreted as being imprisonment for the
			<lb />
			whole of a convict&apos;s natural life within the scope of
			<lb />
			Section 45 of the aforesaid Code. The decision
			<lb />
			in Swamy Shraddananda case [(2008) 13 SCC 767
			<lb />
			: (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 113] was taken in the special
			<lb />
			facts of that case where on account of a very brutal
			<lb />
			murder, the appellant had been sentenced to death
			<lb />
			by the trial court and the reference had been
			<lb />
			accepted by the High Court. However, while
			<lb />
			agreeing with the conviction and confirming the
			<lb />
			same, the Hon&apos;ble Judges were of the view that
			<lb />
			however heinous the crime may have been, it did
			<lb />
			not come within the definition of ‗the rarest of rare
			<lb />
			cases&apos; so as to merit a death sentence.

			for a period of 14 years, as envisaged under
			<lb />
			Section 433-A CrPC, could not be acceded to,
			<lb />
			since the sentence of death had been stepped down
			<lb />
			to that of life imprisonment, which was a lesser
			<lb />
			punishment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			22. On a conjoint reading of Sections 45 and 47
			<lb />
			(sic Section 57) of the Penal Code and Sections
			<lb />
			432, 433 and 433-A CrPC, it is now well
			<lb />
			established that a convict awarded life sentence
			<lb />
			has to undergo imprisonment for at least 14 years.
			<lb />
			While Sections 432 and 433 empower the
			<lb />
			appropriate Government to suspend, remit or
			<lb />
			commute sentences, including a sentence of death
			<lb />
			and life imprisonment, a fetter has been imposed
			<lb />
			by the legislature on such powers by the
			<lb />
			introduction of Section 433-A into the Code of
			<lb />
			Criminal Procedure by the amending Act of 1978,
			<lb />
			which came into effect on and from 18-12-1978.
			<lb />
			By virtue of the non obstante clause used in
			<lb />
			Section 433-A, the minimum term of
			<lb />
			imprisonment in respect of an offence where
			<lb />
			death is one of the punishments provided by laws
			<lb />
			or where a death sentence has been commuted to
			<lb />
			life sentence, has been prescribed as 14 years.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			23. In the various decisions rendered after the
			<lb />
			decision in Godse case [AIR 1961 SC 600 : (1961)
			<lb />
			1 Cri LJ 736] , ‗imprisonment for life&apos; has been
			<lb />
			repeatedly held to mean imprisonment for the
			<lb />
			natural life term of a convict, though the actual
			<lb />
			period of imprisonment may stand reduced on
			<lb />
			account of remissions earned. But in no case, with
			<lb />
			the possible exception of the powers vested in the
			<lb />
			President under Article 72 of the Constitution and
			<lb />
			the powers vested in the Governor under Article
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 95
			<lb />
			161 of the Constitution, even with remissions
			<lb />
			earned, can a sentence of imprisonment for life be
			<lb />
			reduced to below 14 years. It is thereafter left to
			<lb />
			the discretion of the authorities concerned to
			<lb />
			determine the actual length of imprisonment
			<lb />
			having regard to the gravity and intensity of the
			<lb />
			offence.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			113. The discussion in the concurring judgment in (2013) 5 SCC
			<lb />
			546, Shanker Kisanrao Khade v. State of Maharashtra, by Justice
			<lb />
			Madan B. Lokur on the question being considered by us is
			<lb />
			illuminating and deserves to be extracted in extenso. It reads as
			<lb />
			follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-82. My learned Brother Radhakrishnan, J. has put in
			<lb />
			great efforts in analysing a species of cases (of which I
			<lb />
			am sure there would be many more) in which the victim
			<lb />
			was raped and murdered. These cases fall in two
			<lb />
			categories, namely, those in which the death penalty
			<lb />
			has been confirmed by this Court and those in which it
			<lb />
			has been converted to life imprisonment. In my view,
			<lb />
			there is a third category consisting of cases (which
			<lb />
			cannot be overlooked in the overall context of a
			<lb />
			sentencing policy) in which this Court has, while
			<lb />
			awarding a sentence of imprisonment for life, arrived
			<lb />
			at what is described as a via media and in which a fixed
			<lb />
			term of imprisonment exceeding 14 or 20 years (with or
			<lb />
			without remissions) has been awarded instead of a
			<lb />
			death penalty, or in which the sentence awarded has
			<lb />
			been consecutive and not concurrent.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 96
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			114. Thus the Supreme Court unequivocally declared the third
			<lb />
			category of cases where a fixed sentence of imprisonment was
			<lb />
			awarded as a via media instead of life imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			115. In the judgment reported at (2010) 1 SCC 573 : AIR 2010
			<lb />
			SC 420, Ram Raj v. State of Chhattisgarh, also the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			was concerned with the issue of duration of the sentences. The
			<lb />
			court observed that the convict had undergone about 14 years of
			<lb />
			actual imprisonment which with remission amounted to about 17
			<lb />
			years. In para 5, the court discussed the ratio of the judgment in
			<lb />
			Gopal Vinayak Godse and Dalbir Singh in para 6 wherein the
			<lb />
			option of the convicting court to impose a sentence of
			<lb />
			imprisonment which shall last as long as life lasts, where there are
			<lb />
			exceptional indications of murderous recidivism and the
			<lb />
			community cannot run the risk of the convict being at large. In this
			<lb />
			case also, it was found that it was not a fit case for release on
			<lb />
			completion of 14 years. The petitioner&apos;s case for premature release
			<lb />
			was directed to be taken up by the authorities concerned after he
			<lb />
			had completed 20 years imprisonment including remissions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			116. On the same aspect in (2012) 8 SCC 537, State of U.P. v.
			<lb />
			Sanjay Kumar, after considering the jurisprudence on the issue of
			<lb />
			imposing a fixed term sentence in cases where the court was
			<lb />
			empowered to impose a death sentence, in para 24, the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court held thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			-
		</p>
		<p>
			24. In view of the above, we reach the inescapable
			<lb />
			conclusion that the submissions advanced by the learned
			<lb />
			counsel for the State are unfounded. The aforesaid
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 97
			<lb />
			judgments make it crystal clear that this Court has
			<lb />
			merely found out the via media, where considering the
			<lb />
			facts and circumstances of a particular case, by way of
			<lb />
			which it has come to the conclusion that it was not the
			<lb />
			-rarest of rare cases‖, warranting death penalty, but a
			<lb />
			sentence of 14 years or 20 years, as referred to in the
			<lb />
			guidelines laid down by the States would be totally
			<lb />
			inadequate. The life imprisonment cannot be
			<lb />
			equivalent to imprisonment for 14 years or 20 years,
			<lb />
			rather it always meant as the whole natural life. ...‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			117. In Sanjay Kumar, the &apos;third category&apos; (Khade) is referred to
			<lb />
			as the sentencing via media found by the court wherein the case
			<lb />
			does not fall in the rarest of rare category but imprisonment of
			<lb />
			14/20 years would be inadequate.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			118. In (2014) 3 SCC 421 : 2014 (2) SCALE 293, Birju v. State
			<lb />
			of M.P. as well as (2014) 4 SCC 747 : 2014 (3) SCALE 344,
			<lb />
			Ashok Debbarma v. State of Tripura also the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			awarded the appellants imprisonment for 20 years over and above
			<lb />
			the period already undergone without remission.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			119. In the judgment of the Supreme Court reported at (2008) 13
			<lb />
			SCC 767, Swamy Shraddananda (2) v. State of Karnataka, the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court was examining the validity of death sentence
			<lb />
			imposed upon the appellant by the High Court. The facts of this
			<lb />
			case may usefully be recounted. The conviction of Swamy
			<lb />
			Shraddananda (2) under Section 302 for offence of murder resulted
			<lb />
			in the sentence of death by the Sessions Judge which was
			<lb />
			confirmed by the Karnataka High Court. The matter was first
			<lb />
			heard by a Bench of two Judges in the Supreme Court, one of
			<lb />
			pg. 98
			<lb />
			whom held that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the
			<lb />
			punishment of live imprisonment, rather than death would serve
			<lb />
			the ends of justice. A further declaration was made that the
			<lb />
			appellant would not be released from prison till the end of his life.
			<lb />
			The other Judge had affirmed the death sentence. The matter was
			<lb />
			consequently placed before the three Judge Bench which judgment
			<lb />
			is being referred to herein.
			<lb />
			The three judge Bench of the Supreme Court considered the
			<lb />
			provisions of Sections 432, 433 and 433A of the Cr.P.C. which
			<lb />
			deal with the power to suspend or remit the sentences and
			<lb />
			commented upon the same in the following terms:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-56. But this leads to a more important question about the
			<lb />
			punishment commensurate to the appellant&apos;s crime. The
			<lb />
			sentence of imprisonment for a term of 14 years, that goes
			<lb />
			under the euphemism of life imprisonment is equally, if
			<lb />
			not more, unacceptable. As a matter of fact, Mr Hegde
			<lb />
			informed us that the appellant was taken in custody on 28-
			<lb />
			3-1994 and submitted that by virtue of the provisions
			<lb />
			relating to remission, the sentence of life imprisonment,
			<lb />
			without any qualification or further direction would, in all
			<lb />
			likelihood, lead to his release from jail in the first quarter
			<lb />
			of 2009 since he has already completed more than 14 years
			<lb />
			of incarceration. This eventuality is simply not acceptable
			<lb />
			to this Court. What then is the answer? The answer lies in
			<lb />
			breaking this standardisation that, in practice, renders the
			<lb />
			sentence of life imprisonment equal to imprisonment for a
			<lb />
			period of no more than 14 years; in making it clear that
			<lb />
			the sentence of life imprisonment when awarded as a
			<lb />
			substitute for death penalty would be carried out strictly
			<lb />
			as directed by the Court. This Court, therefore, must lay
			<lb />
			down a good and sound legal basis for putting the
			<lb />
			punishment of imprisonment for life, awarded as
			<lb />
			substitute for death penalty, beyond any remission and to
			<lb />
			be carried out as directed by the Court so that it may be
			<lb />
			followed, in appropriate cases as a uniform policy not
			<lb />
			only by this Court but also by the High Courts, being the
			<lb />
			superior courts in their respective States. A suggestion to
			<lb />
			this effect was made by this Court nearly thirty years ago in
			<lb />
			Dalbir Singh v. State of Punjab [(1979) 3 SCC 745 : 1979
			<lb />
			SCC (Cri) 848] . In para 14 of the judgment this Court held
			<lb />
			and observed as follows: (SCC p. 753)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-14. The sentences of death in the present appeal are
			<lb />
			liable to be reduced to life imprisonment. We may add a
			<lb />
			footnote to the ruling in Rajendra Prasad case[Rajendra
			<lb />
			Prasad v. State of U.P., (1979) 3 SCC 646 : 1979 SCC
			<lb />
			(Cri) 749] . Taking the cue from the English legislation
			<lb />
			on abolition, we may suggest that life imprisonment
			<lb />
			which strictly means imprisonment for the whole of the
			<lb />
			men&apos;s life but in practice amounts to incarceration for a
			<lb />
			period between 10 and 14 years may, at the option of
			<lb />
			the convicting court, be subject to the condition that
			<lb />
			the sentence of imprisonment shall last as long as life
			<lb />
			lasts, where there are exceptional indications of
			<lb />
			murderous recidivism and the community cannot run the
			<lb />
			risk of the convict being at large. This takes care of
			<lb />
			judicial apprehensions that unless physically liquidated
			<lb />
			the culprit may at some remote time repeat murder.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(emphasis added)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			We think that it is time that the course suggested in Dalbir
			<lb />
			Singh [(1979) 3 SCC 745 : 1979 SCC (Cri) 848] should
			<lb />
			receive a formal recognition by the Court.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			57. As a matter of fact there are sufficient precedents for
			<lb />
			the Court to take such a course. In a number of cases this
			<lb />
			Court has substituted death penalty by life imprisonment or
			<lb />
			in some cases for a term of twenty years with the further
			<lb />
			direction that the convict would not be released for the rest
			<lb />
			of his life or until the twenty-year term was actually served
			<lb />
			out.‖
			<lb />
			noted precedents where death sentences were substituted for term
			<lb />
			imprisonment sentences in the following terms:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;66. In Nazir Khan v. State of Delhi [(2003) 8 SCC 461 :
			<lb />
			2003 SCC (Cri) 2033] , three of the appellants before the
			<lb />
			Court were sentenced to death for committing offences
			<lb />
			punishable under Section 364-A read with Section 120-B
			<lb />
			IPC. They were also convicted under the provisions of the
			<lb />
			Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act
			<lb />
			(TADA) with different terms of imprisonment for those
			<lb />
			offences. This Court, however, commuted the death
			<lb />
			sentence of the three appellants but having regard to the
			<lb />
			gravity of the offences and the dastardly nature of their acts
			<lb />
			directed for their incarceration for a period of 20 years with
			<lb />
			the further direction that the accused-appellants would not
			<lb />
			be entitled to any remission from the term of 20 years.
			<lb />
			Reference was made to the earlier decisions in Ashok
			<lb />
			Kumar v. Union of India [(1991) 3 SCC 498 : 1991 SCC
			<lb />
			(Cri) 845] and Sat Pal v. State of Haryana[(1992) 4 SCC
			<lb />
			172 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 866] .
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			67. On a perusal of the seven decisions discussed above
			<lb />
			and the decisions referred to therein it would appear that
			<lb />
			this Court modified the death sentence to imprisonment
			<lb />
			for life or in some cases imprisonment for a term of
			<lb />
			twenty years with the further direction that the convict
			<lb />
			must not be released from prison for the rest of his life or
			<lb />
			before actually serving out the term of twenty years, as the
			<lb />
			case may be, mainly on two premises; one, an
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life, in terms of Section 53 read with
			<lb />
			Section 45 of the Penal Code meant imprisonment for the
			<lb />
			rest of life of the prisoner and two, a convict undergoing
			<lb />
			life imprisonment has no right to claim remission. In
			<lb />
			support of the second premise reliance is placed on the line
			<lb />
			of decisions beginning from Gopal Vinayak Godse v. State
			<lb />
			of Maharashtra [AIR 1961 SC 600 : (1961) 3 SCR 440]
			<lb />
			and coming down to Mohd. Munna v. Union of
			<lb />
			India[(2005) 7 SCC 417 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 1688].&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			121. The Supreme Court considered the working of the provisions
			<lb />
			of commutation/remission, etc. contained in the Code of Criminal
			<lb />
			Procedure, the Prisons Acts as well as the rules framed by the
			<lb />
			different States, in the pronouncement in Swamy Shraddananda
			<lb />
			(2) v. State of Karnataka i.e. excluding the State&apos;s sovereign
			<lb />
			power under Constitution of India observing as follows:
			<lb />
			-88. It is thus to be seen that both in Karnataka and
			<lb />
			Bihar remission is granted to life convicts
			<lb />
			by deemed conversion of life imprisonment into a fixed
			<lb />
			term of 20 years. The deemed conversion of life
			<lb />
			imprisonment into one for fixed term by executive
			<lb />
			orders issued by the State Governments apparently flies
			<lb />
			in the face of a long line of decisions by this Court and
			<lb />
			we are afraid no provision of law was brought to our
			<lb />
			notice to sanction such a course. It is thus to be seen that
			<lb />
			life convicts are granted remission and released from
			<lb />
			prison on completing the fourteen-year term without any
			<lb />
			sound legal basis. One can safely assume that the
			<lb />
			position would be no better in the other States. This
			<lb />
			Court can also take judicial notice of the fact that
			<lb />
			remission is allowed to life convicts in the most
			<lb />
			mechanical manner without any sociological or
			<lb />
			psychiatric appraisal of the convict and without any
			<lb />
			proper assessment as to the effect of the early release of
			<lb />
			a particular convict on the society. The grant of
			<lb />
			remission is the rule and remission is denied, one may
			<lb />
			say, in the rarest of rare cases.‖
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			122. The court placed reliance on the observations by the
			<lb />
			Constitution Bench in para 156 of Bachan Singh on this aspect
			<lb />
			and reiterated the observations in Jagmohan in para 89 of Swamy
			<lb />
			Shraddananda (2), the Supreme Court concluding as follows:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-89. ... Thus all that is changed by Section 433-A is
			<lb />
			that before its insertion an imprisonment for life in most
			<lb />
			cases worked out to a dozen years of imprisonment and
			<lb />
			after its introduction it works out to fourteen years&apos;
			<lb />
			imprisonment. But the observation in Jagmohan [(1973)
			<lb />
			1 SCC 20 : 1973 SCC (Cri) 169 : AIR 1973 SC 947]
			<lb />
			that this cannot be accepted as an adequate substitute
			<lb />
			for the death penalty still holds true.‖

			appearing for Vikas Yadav rests on the following observations by
			<lb />
			the court in para 91 of (2008) 13 SCC 767 (page 804), Swamy
			<lb />
			Shraddananda (2) v. State of Karnataka:

			Vinayak Godse [AIR 1961 SC 600 : (1961) 3 SCR

			<lb />
			(Cri) 1095] and the unsound way in which remission is
			<lb />
			actually allowed in cases of life imprisonment make out
			<lb />
			a very strong case to make a special category for the
			<lb />
			very few cases where the death penalty might be
			<lb />
			substituted by the punishment of imprisonment for life
			<lb />
			or imprisonment for a term in excess of fourteen years
			<lb />
			and to put that category beyond the application of
			<lb />
			remission.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			124. This submission however, fails to consider the examination
			<lb />
			undertaken by the court in paras 92 to 94 of the report which read
			<lb />
			thus:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-92. The matter may be looked at from a slightly
			<lb />
			different angle. The issue of sentencing has two aspects.
			<lb />
			A sentence may be excessive and unduly harsh or it may
			<lb />
			be highly disproportionately inadequate. When an
			<lb />
			appellant comes to this Court carrying a death sentence
			<lb />
			awarded by the trial court and confirmed by the High
			<lb />
			Court, this Court may find, as in the present appeal, that
			<lb />
			the case just falls short of the rarest of the rare
			<lb />
			category and may feel somewhat reluctant in
			<lb />
			endorsing the death sentence. But at the same time,
			<lb />
			having regard to the nature of the crime, the Court may
			<lb />
			strongly feel that a sentence of life imprisonment
			<lb />
			subject to remission normally works out to a term of 14
			<lb />
			years would be grossly disproportionate and
			<lb />
			inadequate. What then should the Court do? If the
			<lb />
			Court&apos;s option is limited only to two punishments, one
			<lb />
			a sentence of imprisonment, for all intents and
			<lb />
			purposes, of not more than 14 years and the other
			<lb />
			death, the Court may feel tempted and find itself
			<lb />
			nudged into endorsing the death penalty. Such a course
			<lb />
			would indeed be disastrous. A far more just, reasonable
			<lb />
			and proper course would be to expand the options and
			<lb />
			to take over what, as a matter of fact, lawfully belongs
			<lb />
			to the Court i.e. the vast hiatus between 14 years&apos;
			<lb />
			imprisonment and death. It needs to be emphasised that
			<lb />
			the Court would take recourse to the expanded option
			<lb />
			primarily because in the facts of the case, the sentence
			<lb />
			of 14 years&apos; imprisonment would amount to no
			<lb />
			punishment at all.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			93. Further, the formalisation of a special category of
			<lb />
			sentence, though for an extremely few number of
			<lb />
			cases, shall have the great advantage of having the
			<lb />
			death penalty on the statute book but to actually use it
			<lb />
			as little as possible, really in the rarest of rare cases.
			<lb />
			This would only be a reassertion of the Constitution
			<lb />
			Bench decision in Bachan Singh [(1980) 2 SCC 684 :
			<lb />
			1980 SCC (Cri) 580 : AIR 1980 SC 898] besides being
			<lb />
			in accord with the modern trends in penology.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			94. In the light of the discussions made above we are
			<lb />
			clearly of the view that there is a good and strong basis
			<lb />
			for the Court to substitute a death sentence by life
			<lb />
			imprisonment or by a term in excess of fourteen years
			<lb />
			and further to direct that the convict must not be
			<lb />
			released from the prison for the rest of his life or for
			<lb />
			the actual term as specified in the order, as the case
			<lb />
			may be.‖

			125. On the aspect of exercise of the power of the executive under
			<lb />
			Section 432 Cr.P.C. to grant remissions and its curtailment by
			<lb />
			courts handing out mandatory terms sentences, we find that in
			<lb />
			(2013) 2 SCC 452 : (2012) 11 SCALE 140, Sangeet &amp; Anr. v.
			<lb />
			State of Haryana, the two Judge Bench of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			referring to the larger Bench decisions of the Supreme Court, noted

		</item>
		<item>
			-52. Swamy Shraddananda [(2008) 13 SCC 767 :
			<lb />
			(2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 113] and some of the decisions
			<lb />
			referred to therein have taken us to Phase III in the
			<lb />
			evolution of a sound sentencing policy. The focus in this
			<lb />
			phase is on criminal law and sentencing, and we are
			<lb />
			really concerned with this in the present case. The issue
			<lb />
			under consideration in this phase is the punishment to
			<lb />
			be given in cases where the death penalty ought not to
			<lb />
			be awarded, and a life sentence is inadequate given the
			<lb />
			power of remission available with the appropriate
			<lb />
			Government under Section 432 CrPC. In such a
			<lb />
			situation, what is the punishment that is
			<lb />
			commensurate with the offence?

			55. A reading of some recent decisions delivered by this
			<lb />
			Court seems to suggest that the remission power of the
			<lb />
			appropriate Government has effectively been nullified
			<lb />
			by awarding sentences of 20 years, 25 years and in some
			<lb />
			cases without any remission. Is this permissible? Can
			<lb />
			this Court (or any court for that matter) restrain the
			<lb />
			appropriate Government from granting remission of a
			<lb />
			sentence to a convict? What this Court has done
			<lb />
			in Swamy Shraddananda [(2008) 13 SCC 767 : (2009) 3
			<lb />
			SCC (Cri) 113] and several other cases, by giving a
			<lb />
			sentence in a capital offence of 20 years&apos; or 30 years&apos;
			<lb />
			imprisonment without remission, is to effectively
			<lb />
			injunct the appropriate Government from exercising its
			<lb />
			power of remission for the specified period. In our
			<lb />
			opinion, this issue needs further and greater discussion,
			<lb />
			but as at present advised, we are of the opinion that this
			<lb />
			is not permissible. The appropriate Government cannot
			<lb />
			be told that it is prohibited from granting remission of a
			<lb />
			sentence. Similarly, a convict cannot be told that he
			<lb />
			cannot apply for a remission in his sentence, whatever
			<lb />
			be the reason.‖

			126. In para 68 of Sangeet, the court placed reliance on the
			<lb />
			Constitution Bench pronouncement in AIR 1961 SC 600, Gopal
			<lb />
			Vinayak Godse v. State of Maharashtra observing as follows:
			<lb />
			-68. Briefly stated the legal position is this: Before Act
			<lb />
			26 of 1955 a sentence of transportation for life could be
			<lb />
			undergone by a prisoner by way of rigorous
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life in a designated prison in India.
			<lb />
			After the said Act, such a convict shall be dealt with in
			<lb />
			the same manner as one sentenced to rigorous
			<lb />
			imprisonment for the same term. Unless the said
			<lb />
			sentence is commuted or remitted by appropriate
			<lb />
			authority under the relevant provisions of the Penal
			<lb />
			Code or the Code of Criminal Procedure, a prisoner
			<lb />
			sentenced to life imprisonment is bound in law to serve
			<lb />
			the life term in prison. The rules framed under the
			<lb />
			Prisons Act enable such a prisoner to earn remissions-
			<lb />
			ordinary, special and State-and the said remissions
			<lb />
			will be given credit towards his term of imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			For the purpose of working out the remissions the
			<lb />
			sentence of transportation for life is ordinarily equated
			<lb />
			with a definite period, but it is only for that particular
			<lb />
			purpose and not for any other purpose. As the
			<lb />
			sentence of transportation for life or its prison
			<lb />
			equivalent, the life imprisonment, is one of indefinite
			<lb />
			duration, the remissions so earned do not in practice
			<lb />
			help such a convict as it is not possible to predicate the
			<lb />
			time of his death. That is why the rules provide for a
			<lb />
			procedure to enable an appropriate Government to
			<lb />
			remit the sentence under Section 401 [now Section
			<lb />
			432] of the Code of Criminal Procedure on a
			<lb />
			consideration of the relevant factors, including the
			<lb />
			period of remissions earned.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			127. In para 69 of Sangeet, the Bench considered the issue as to
			<lb />
			whether there is any provision of law whereunder the sentence of
			<lb />
			life imprisonment, without any final remission by the appropriate
			<lb />
			government, can be automatically treated as one for the definite
			<lb />
			period? It was observed in Gopal Vinayak Godse that no such
			<lb />
			provision was to be found in the Indian Penal Code, Code of
			<lb />
			Criminal Procedure or the Prisoner&apos;s Act. The Constitution Bench
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 107
			<lb />
			had also ruled in Gopal Vinayak Godse that a prisoner sentenced
			<lb />
			for transportation for life had no indefeasible right to unconditional
			<lb />
			release on the expiry of a particular term including the remissions.
			<lb />
			It was declared in Gopal Vinayak Godse that -the rules under the
			<lb />
			Prisons Act do not substitute a lesser sentence for a sentence of
			<lb />
			transportation for life‖.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			128. In para 70 of Sangeet, the court has set out the reiteration of
			<lb />
			the view taken in (1976) 3 SCC 470, State of Madhya Pradesh v.
			<lb />
			Rattan Singh wherein (following Gopal Vinayak Godse), it was
			<lb />
			observed as follows:
			<lb />
			-70. ... In other words, this Court has clearly held that
			<lb />
			a sentence for life would enure till the lifetime of the
			<lb />
			accused as it is not possible to fix a particular period of
			<lb />
			the prisoner&apos;s death and remissions given under the
			<lb />
			Rules could not be regarded as a substitute [of a lesser
			<lb />
			sentence] for a sentence of transportation for life. In
			<lb />
			these circumstances, therefore, it is clear that the High
			<lb />
			Court was in error in thinking that the respondent was
			<lb />
			entitled to be released as of right on completing the
			<lb />
			term of 20 years including the remissions.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			129. From paras 74 to 79 of Sangeet, the court considered the
			<lb />
			application of Section 432 of the Cr.P.C. and held as follows:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			There is a misconception that a prisoner serving a life
			<lb />
			sentence has an indefeasible right to release on completion of
			<lb />
			either 14 years or 20 years. (para 70)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii) A convict undergoing life imprisonment is expected to
			<lb />
			remain in custody till the end of his life subject to any remission
			<lb />
			granted by the appropriate government under Section 432 of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. (para 71)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii) The grant of remissions is statutory. Section 432 of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. has a limited application to a convict and its applicability
			<lb />
			to a convict serving a definite term imprisonment is different from
			<lb />
			one undergoing life imprisonment. (paras 75 and 76)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv) The power under this section is available only for granting
			<lb />
			-additional‖ remission, that is, for a period over and above the
			<lb />
			remission granted or awarded to a convict under the Jail Manual or
			<lb />
			other statutory rules. If the term of sentence is indefinite (as in life
			<lb />
			imprisonment), the power under Section 432 CrPC can certainly be
			<lb />
			exercised but not on the basis that life imprisonment is an arbitrary
			<lb />
			or notional figure of twenty years of imprisonment. (para 77.6)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(v) In case of a convict undergoing life imprisonment, he will be
			<lb />
			in custody for an indeterminate period. Therefore, remissions
			<lb />
			earned by or awarded to such a life convict are only notional. To
			<lb />
			reduce the period of such incarceration, a specific order under
			<lb />
			Section 432 of the Cr.P.C. will have to be passed by the
			<lb />
			appropriate government. Such reduced period cannot be less than
			<lb />
			14 years as per Section 433A of the Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(vi) However, to prevent its arbitrary exercise, the legislature has
			<lb />
			built in some procedural and substantive checks in the statute.
			<lb />
			These need to be faithfully enforced. (para 80 sub para 77.5)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(vii) Before actually exercising the power of remission under
			<lb />
			Section 432 CrPC the appropriate Government must obtain the
			<lb />
			opinion (with reasons) of the Presiding Judge of the convicting
			<lb />
			or confirming Court. Remissions can, therefore, be given only on
			<lb />
			a case-by-case basis and not in a wholesale manner.‖ (para 77.7)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			130. We note below some cases where the Supreme Court has
			<lb />
			directed postponement of consideration of remission of the
			<lb />
			sentence of life imprisonment for 20 years or other terms:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			(1991) 3 SCC 498, Ashok Kumar v. Union of India : Held
			<lb />
			that the petitioner had not completed 14 years of actual
			<lb />
			incarceration and he cannot invoke Sections 432 and 433 of
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. His detention was consistent with Section 433A Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
			Hence writ of mandamus dismissed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(ii) (1992) 4 SCC 172, Satpal v. State of Haryana : Appellant
			<lb />
			having undergone 13 years and 6 months&apos; actual imprisonment and
			<lb />
			over 17 years&apos; imprisonment including remission, not entitled to be
			<lb />
			released on ground that government must be deemed to have
			<lb />
			commuted his sentence to 14 years.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii) (2002) 2 SCC 35, Prakash Dhawal Khairnar (Patil) v. State
			<lb />
			of Maharashtra : The court directed that the accused shall not be
			<lb />
			released from prison unless he had served at least 20 years of
			<lb />
			imprisonment including the period already undergone by the
			<lb />
			appellant.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iv) (2002) 6 SCC 686, Ram Anup Singh &amp; Ors. v. State of
			<lb />
			Bihar : The court sentenced the appellants -Lallan Singh and
			<lb />
			Babban Singh to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life with the
			<lb />
			condition that they shall not be released before completing an
			<lb />
			actual term of 20 years including the period undergone by them.
			<lb />
			There was no interference with the appeal of the appellant -Ram
			<lb />
			Anup Singh in whose case the High Court had given life
			<lb />
			imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			131. There are several other instances where enhancement of the
			<lb />
			sentence of life imprisonment to death penalty was sought before
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court. Instead, the Supreme Court gave term
			<lb />
			imprisonments.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			132. Some of the cases where term sentences have been imposed,
			<lb />
			not an exhaustive list, have been placed by Mr. Rajesh Mahajan,

			learned Additional Standing Counsel are listed below :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>

			<lb />
			who they wanted to kill, held not entitled to any commutation or

			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(v) In the judgment reported at JT (2005) 8 SC 294, Reddy
			<lb />
			Sampath Kumar v. State of Andhra Pradesh, it was directed that

			the appellant shall not get the benefit of any remission either by the
			<lb />
			State or by the Government of India on any auspicious occasion.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(vi) In (2001) 4 SCC 458, Subash Chander v. Krishan Lal, Trial
			<lb />
			Court had awarded death sentence but the High Court had
			<lb />
			commuted the same to life imprisonment. Subash Chander, a
			<lb />
			witness before the Trial Court filed the appeal praying for setting
			<lb />
			aside the order by the High Court of acquittal of some of the
			<lb />
			accused persons and sought awarding of death sentence to the
			<lb />
			convicted persons, in other words, sought restoration qua them of
			<lb />
			the judgment of the Trial Court. In this case, counsel for the main
			<lb />
			accused made a statement that instead of depriving him of his life,
			<lb />
			the court could pass appropriate orders to deprive him of his liberty
			<lb />
			throughout his life and that if sentenced to life imprisonment, he
			<lb />
			would never claim his premature release or the commutation of his
			<lb />
			release on any ground. The court had passed such sentence in view
			<lb />
			of the said statement.

			Sentence of 30 years without remission in addition to sentence

			already undergone for strangulation of minor boy aged 10 years
			<lb />
			after subjecting him to carnal intercourse.
			<lb />
			The judicial pronouncements noticed by us show that the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court has extensively exercised the option of directing a
			<lb />
			fixed term of imprisonment before exercise of the discretion by the
			<lb />
			executive under Section 432 Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(iv) Submission that a fixed term for life sentence which is in
			<lb />
			excess of fourteen years imprisonment can be ordered only
			<lb />
			by the Supreme Court restricted to cases where death
			<lb />
			sentence is being commuted to life and the power of courts
			<lb />
			to curtail remission is not available to all courts
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			133. Let us now examine the power of the courts (other than the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court) to impose sentences. The power of the courts to
			<lb />
			award sentences is governed by Section 28 of the Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
			whereunder the High Court is competent to award any sentence
			<lb />
			authorized by law. The Sessions Court is also so empowered,
			<lb />
			except for the requirement of confirmation of the death sentence
			<lb />
			imposed by it.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			134. By virtue of Section 386 of the Cr.P.C., in exercise of its
			<lb />
			appellate jurisdiction which includes the power to consider
			<lb />
			enhancement of a sentence awarded by the trial court, as well, the
			<lb />
			High Court is competent to pass any sentence which may be
			<lb />
			imposed by law or enhance the sentence awarded by the trial court,
			<lb />
			after notice to the convict and affording reasonable opportunity of
			<lb />
			showing cause against such enhancement. Similar power is
			<lb />
			available to the High Court in its revisional jurisdiction.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			135. The restriction on powers of remission or commutation
			<lb />
			prescripted in Section 433A of the Cr.P.C. relates to cases where a
			<lb />
			sentence of imprisonment for life is imposed on conviction of a
			<lb />
			person for an offence for which death is one of the punishments
			<lb />
			provided by law, or where a sentence of death imposed on a person
			<lb />
			has been commuted under section 433 into one of imprisonment
			<lb />
			for life.
			<lb />
			It is evident that by virtue of Section 433A, the legislature
			<lb />
			has restricted the power to release a person sentenced to life
			<lb />
			imprisonment from prison in two eventualities. The first being if
			<lb />
			he has been sentenced to imprisonment for life for an offence for
			<lb />
			which death is one of the punishments provided by law. The
			<lb />
			second is where a sentence of death imposed on a person has been
			<lb />
			commuted under Section 433 into one of the imprisonments for
			<lb />
			life. The statute therefore, draws no distinction as is urged by
			<lb />
			learned counsel for the convict.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			136. The following observations of the Constitution Bench in
			<lb />
			(1980) 2 SCC 684, Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab support the
			<lb />
			above position:
			<lb />
			-156. It may be recalled that in Jagmohan [(1973) 1
			<lb />
			SCC 20 : 1973 SCC (Cri) 169 : (1973) 2 SCR 541] this
			<lb />
			Court had observed that, in practice, life imprisonment
			<lb />
			amounts to 12 years in prison. Now, Section 433-A
			<lb />
			restricts the power of remission and commutation
			<lb />
			conferred on the appropriate Government under
			<lb />
			Sections 432 and 433, so that a person who is sentenced
			<lb />
			to imprisonment for life or whose death sentence is
			<lb />
			commuted to imprisonment for life must serve actual
			<lb />
			imprisonment for a minimum of 14 years.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
			Therefore, while considering an offence for which death is
			<lb />
			one of the punishments, the legislature itself has equated the
			<lb />
			considerations for imposition of life imprisonment to a case where
			<lb />
			a death sentence has been commuted to life imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			137. The defendants do not dispute that the High Court is
			<lb />
			competent to enhance a sentence of imprisonment awarded by the
			<lb />
			Trial Court to a death sentence. In fact, a death sentence awarded
			<lb />
			by the trial judge has to be referred for confirmation by the High
			<lb />
			Court under Section 28(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			138. It also cannot be disputed that a fixed term sentence or
			<lb />
			minimum imprisonment prescription is a lesser sentence than the
			<lb />
			death sentence. It has been so observed in several cases by the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court (including Swamy Shraddananda (2) v. State of
			<lb />
			Karnataka) wherein it is recognized as a third option.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			139. In the given circumstances, in view of the principles laid
			<lb />
			down in Swamy Shraddananda (2), does a convicting and
			<lb />
			sentencing court not have three sentencing options instead of two?
			<lb />
			We have discussed above the several precedents wherein the court
			<lb />
			has carved out a third category of cases, one being an ordinary
			<lb />
			murder case where sentence of life imprisonment seems to be
			<lb />
			adequate punishment for the offence of murder; the second being a
			<lb />
			case which falls in the rarest of rare category inviting the death
			<lb />
			penalty and the third which falls just short of &apos;rarest of rare&apos; but
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 117
			<lb />
			would be more heinous than an ordinary murder, for which the
			<lb />
			normal sentence of life imprisonment subject to remissions etc.
			<lb />
			would not be adequate punishment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			140. In para 92 of Swamy Shraddananda (2), the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			noted that if the court&apos;s option is limited only to two punishments,
			<lb />
			one being a sentence of imprisonment which practically works to
			<lb />
			not more than 14 years and the other is death, more courts would
			<lb />
			be pursuaded into endorsing death penalty which would work
			<lb />
			grave injustice. The court thus provided the third option as the vast
			<lb />
			hiatus between 14 years&apos; imprisonment and death as &quot;special
			<lb />
			category of sentence&quot; (para 92). We also find that the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court has carefully referred to this court as well as the court clearly
			<lb />
			underlining the fact that the third option was available to any court
			<lb />
			which is undertaking the exercise of sentencing (para 94). It is
			<lb />
			also recognized that the sentencing court would be empowered to
			<lb />
			direct that the convict would not be released from the prison &quot;for
			<lb />
			the rest of his life&quot; or &quot;for the actual term as specified in the
			<lb />
			order&quot;, as the case may be.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			141. In exercise of power under Section 28 of the Cr.P.C., the
			<lb />
			High Court also has the power to commute death sentence to life
			<lb />
			imprisonment. If this be the statutory power of the High Court,
			<lb />
			then it certainly has the power to impose a term sentence which,
			<lb />
			though lesser than the death sentence, is graver than a sentence of
			<lb />
			life imprisonment which is subjected to the application of Section
			<lb />
			433A of the Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			142. The submission of the respondents, therefore, is that though
			<lb />
			the High Court is competent to award the death sentence, it cannot
			<lb />
			award the lesser sentence of a fixed term imprisonment! Such a
			<lb />
			submission certainly is beyond logic and is completely
			<lb />
			unreasonable.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			143. It is trite that a larger or wider power necessarily includes the
			<lb />
			lesser, narrower, incidental or ancillary power [Ref. : (1997) 3
			<lb />
			SCC 346 (para 4), Mohinder Singh v. State of Punjab; (2009) 2
			<lb />
			SCC 1 (para 37), Mahamadhusen Abdulrahim Kalota Shaikh(2)
			<lb />
			v. Union of India &amp; Ors.].
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			144. In this regard, the observations of the Supreme Court in para
			<lb />
			14 of the pronouncement reported at (1979) 3 SCC 745, Dalbir
			<lb />
			Singh v. State of Punjab are relevant and deserve to be considered
			<lb />
			in extenso. Para 14 thereof reads as follows:
			<lb />
			-14. The sentences of death in the present appeal are
			<lb />
			liable to be reduced to life imprisonment. We may add a
			<lb />
			footnote to the ruling in Rajendra Prasad case. Taking
			<lb />
			the cue from the English legislation on abolition, we
			<lb />
			may suggest that life imprisonment which strictly means
			<lb />
			imprisonment for the whole of the man&apos;s life, but in
			<lb />
			practice amounts to incarceration for a period between
			<lb />
			10 and 14 years may, at the option of the convicting
			<lb />
			court, be subject to the condition that the sentence of
			<lb />
			imprisonment shall last as long as life lasts where there
			<lb />
			are exceptional indications of murderous recidivism and
			<lb />
			the community cannot run the risk of the convict being
			<lb />
			at large. This takes care of judicial apprehensions that
			<lb />
			unless physically liquidated the culprit may at some
			<lb />
			remote time repeat murder.‖

			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

			<lb />
			pg. 119
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			145. If it were held that the trial court or the high courts did not
			<lb />
			have the power to grant such lesser sentence, the consequences
			<lb />
			could be drastic. As observed in para 92 of Swamy Shraddananda
			<lb />
			(2), if sentencing courts did not have a third option and had to
			<lb />
			choose between a 14 year life sentence and the death punishment,
			<lb />
			for a serious crime, more courts would be persuaded to impose the
			<lb />
			death sentence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			146. Let us examining the two precedents heavily relied upon by
			<lb />
			Mr. Verma, learned counsel for the defendant. In the judgment
			<lb />
			reported at (2013) 9 SCC 778, Sahib Hussain @ Sahib Jain v.
			<lb />
			State of Rajasthan, the Supreme Court was called upon to decide
			<lb />
			inter alia whether the High Court was justified in ordering that the
			<lb />
			appellants should be sentenced to 20 years of actual imprisonment
			<lb />
			without remissions. The Supreme Court noted the decisions in
			<lb />
			some cases where the court had awarded minimum years of
			<lb />
			imprisonment of 20, 25, 30 or 35 years. The Supreme Court took
			<lb />
			judicial notice of the fact that remission is allowed to life convicts
			<lb />
			in a most mechanical manner without any sociological or
			<lb />
			psychiatric appraisal of the convict and without any proper
			<lb />
			assessment as to the effect of the earlier release of the particular
			<lb />
			convict on the society. We also set down para 29 of the judgment
			<lb />
			hereunder as it cites the precedent in (2009) 15 SCC 551, Haru
			<lb />
			Ghosh v. State of West Bengal wherein, it was the High Court
			<lb />
			which commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment which
			<lb />
			decision of the High Court was upheld. We also extract paras 36
			<lb />
			and 37 of the report which refer to other precedents hereafter:
			<lb />
			-
		</p>
		<item>
			43. That leaves us with a question as to what
			<lb />
			sentence should be passed. Ordinarily, it would
			<lb />
			be the imprisonment for life. However, that
			<lb />
			would be no punishment to the appellant-
			<lb />
			accused, as he is already under the shadow of
			<lb />
			sentence of imprisonment for life, though he has
			<lb />
			been bailed out by the High Court. Under the
			<lb />
			circumstance, in our opinion, it will be better to
			<lb />
			take the course taken by this Court in Swamy
			<lb />
			Shraddananda [(2008) 13 SCC 767 : (2009) 3
			<lb />
			SCC (Cri) 113] where the Court referred to the
			<lb />
			hiatus between the death sentence on one part
			<lb />
			and the life imprisonment, which actually might
			<lb />
			come to fourteen years&apos; imprisonment. ...

		<item>
			36. It is clear that in Swamy Shraddananda [(2008)
			<lb />
			13 SCC 767 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 113] , this Court noted
			<lb />
			the observations made by this Court in Jagmohan
			<lb />
			Singh v. State of U.P. [Jagmohan Singh v. State of U.P.,
			<lb />
			(1973) 1 SCC 20 : 1973 SCC (Cri) 169] and five years
			<lb />
			after the judgment in Jagmohan case [Jagmohan
			<lb />
			Singh v. State of U.P., (1973) 1 SCC 20 : 1973 SCC
			<lb />
			(Cri) 169] , Section 433-A was inserted in the Code
			<lb />
			imposing a restriction on the power of remission or
			<lb />
			commutation in certain cases. After the introduction of
			<lb />
			Section 433-A another Constitution Bench of this Court
			<lb />
			in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab [Bachan Singh
			<lb />
			v. State of Punjab, (1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC
			<lb />
			(Cri) 580], with reference to power with regard to
			<lb />
			Section 433-A which restricts the power of remission
			<lb />
			and commutation conferred on the appropriate
			<lb />
			Government, noted various provisions of the Prisons
			<lb />
			Act, Jail Manual, etc. and concluded that reasonable
			<lb />
			and proper course would be to expand the option
			<lb />
			between 14 years&apos; imprisonment and death. The larger
			<lb />
			Bench has also emphasised that: [Swamy
			<lb />
			Shraddananda (2) case [(2008) 13 SCC 767 : (2009) 3
			<lb />
			SCC (Cri) 113] , SCC p. 805, para 92]
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;92. … the Court would take recourse to the
			<lb />
			expanded option primarily because in the facts of
			<lb />
			the case, the sentence of 14 years&apos; imprisonment
			<lb />
			would amount to no punishment at all.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			In the light of the detailed discussion by the larger
			<lb />
			Bench, we are of the view that the observations made
			<lb />
			in Sangeet case [(2013) 2 SCC 452 : (2013) 2 SCC
			<lb />
			(Cri) 611] are not warranted. Even otherwise, the
			<lb />
			above principles, as enunciated in Swamy
			<lb />
			Shraddananda [(2008) 13 SCC 767 : (2009) 3 SCC
			<lb />
			(Cri) 113] are applicable only when death sentence is
			<lb />
			commuted to life imprisonment and not in all cases
			<lb />
			where the Court imposes sentence for life.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			37. Taking note of the fact that the prosecution has
			<lb />
			established the guilt by way of circumstantial evidence,
			<lb />
			analysed and discussed earlier, and of the fact that in the
			<lb />
			case on hand five persons died and also of the fact that
			<lb />
			the High Court commuted the death sentence into life
			<lb />
			imprisonment imposing certain restrictions, the
			<lb />
			decision of the High Court cannot be faulted with and
			<lb />
			in the light of well-reasoned judgments over a decade,
			<lb />
			we agree with the conclusion arrived at by the High
			<lb />
			Court including the reasons stated therein.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			147. The above extracted judgment in Sahib Hussain @ Sahib
			<lb />
			Jain does not support the contention on behalf of the defendants.
			<lb />
			On the contrary, it reiterates the position that the High Court also
			<lb />
			has available a third sentencing option so far as a murder case
			<lb />
			falling in the ‗rare&apos; description (i.e. more heinous than the ordinary
			<lb />
			murder but falling short of the rarest of rare category), a third
			<lb />
			category of cases. This third option (&apos;via media&apos;) enables the court
			<lb />
			to impose a life imprisonment sentence beyond 14 years
			<lb />
			imprisonment (at which cases of life convicts may be considered
			<lb />
			for commutation) or beyond twenty years. In this case, it was not
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court which was commuting a death sentence to life.
			<lb />
			It was the High Court which had committed the sentence to life
			<lb />
			imprisonment with condition. The Supreme Court was considering
			<lb />
			a challenge by the appellant to the imposition by the High Court of
			<lb />
			the sentence of the life imprisonment with restrictions. The
			<lb />
			challenge was repelled by the Supreme Court. This decision
			<lb />
			reiterates the legal position that so far as sentencing is concerned,
			<lb />
			all courts, be it trial courts, the Sessions Courts, the High Courts as
			<lb />
			well as the Supreme Court have the same powers, of course subject
			<lb />
			to statutory restrictions regarding limits and procedural
			<lb />
			requirements (as confirmation of the death sentence by the High
			<lb />
			Court if imposed by the trial court).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			148. Mr. Sumeet Verma has also placed strong reliance on the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court pronouncement reported at (2013) 10 SCC 631 :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(2013) 10 SCALE 671 (D.O.D. 26 th August, 2013) Gurvail Singh
			<lb />
			@ Gala v. State of Punjab. Upon the petitioner&apos;s conviction for
			<lb />
			killing four persons, the trial court sentenced Gurvail Singh to
			<lb />
			death which was affirmed by the High Court. In the criminal
			<lb />
			appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction while
			<lb />
			converting the death sentence into life imprisonment with the
			<lb />
			direction that the petitioner shall serve 30 years in jail without
			<lb />
			remission. His review petition in this regard was also rejected.
			<lb />
			The petitioner then filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			seeking a direction to convert the sentence of 30 years in jail
			<lb />
			without remission to a sentence of simple life imprisonment and
			<lb />
			further to declare that the Supreme Court was not competent to fix
			<lb />
			a particular number of years (with or without remission) when
			<lb />
			commuting the death sentence to life imprisonment while
			<lb />
			upholding the conviction of the accused under Section 302 of the
			<lb />
			IPC. The court extracted para 29 of Sahib Hussain @ Sahib Jain
			<lb />
			(also reproduced by us) and dismissed the writ petition.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			149. Before us, in support of his submission that curtailment of
			<lb />
			remissions can be done only by the Supreme Court, which power is
			<lb />
			also restricted to cases where the court is commuting the death
			<lb />
			sentence to life. Mr. Verma, learned counsel for the convict has
			<lb />
			extensively relied on the following observations contained in para
			<lb />
			12 of Gurvail Singh @ Gala:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;12. Thus, it is evident that the issue raised in this
			<lb />
			petition has been considered by another Bench and after
			<lb />
			reconsidering all the relevant judgments on the issue the
			<lb />
			Court
			<lb />
			found
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			observations
			<lb />
			made
			<lb />
			in Sangeet [(2013) 2 SCC 452 : (2013) 2 SCC (Cri) 611]
			<lb />
			were unwarranted i.e. no such observations should have
			<lb />
			been made. This Court issued orders to deprive a
			<lb />
			convict from the benefit of remissions only in cases
			<lb />
			where the death sentence has been commuted to life
			<lb />
			imprisonment and it does not apply in all the cases
			<lb />
			wherein the person has been sentenced to life
			<lb />
			imprisonment.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			150. There can be no dispute with the submission of Mr. Sumeet
			<lb />
			Verma, learned counsel for Vikas Yadav, that the law declared by
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court is binding on all courts under Article 141 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			151. It is at the same time necessary to point out that the issue
			<lb />
			being considered by us has not been raised in any of the judicial
			<lb />
			pronouncements placed before us. In the precedents placed before
			<lb />
			us, the courts have discussed the factual matrix and imposed the
			<lb />
			minimum imprisonment sentences or directed postponement of
			<lb />
			remission.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			152. In both Sahib Hussain @ Sahib Jain and in Gurvail Singh
			<lb />
			@ Gala, there was no issue about the power of the High Court to
			<lb />
			postpone remission or impose a fixed term imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			153. We also find that in both these judgments, the court noted
			<lb />
			the pronouncement of the larger Bench of Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			Swamy Shraddananda (2) v. State of Karnataka that the
			<lb />
			observations in Sangeet on the power of the court to curtail
			<lb />
			remission were not warranted. Furthermore in Sahib Hussain, the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court has upheld the order of the High Court curtailing
			<lb />
			remission.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			154. In Swamy Shraddananda (2), the three Judge Bench of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court has &quot;formally recognized&quot; the recommendation in
			<lb />
			Dalbir Singh of the third sentencing option available to the
			<lb />
			&quot;convicting court&quot; that life imprisonment shall last as long as the
			<lb />
			life of the convict lasts, where there are &quot;exceptional indications of
			<lb />
			murderous recidivism and the society cannot run the risk of the
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 125
			<lb />
			convict being at large&quot;. This third sentencing option is apart from
			<lb />
			&quot;one a sentence of life imprisonment which for all intents and
			<lb />
			purposes is of not more than 14 years and the other death&quot;
			<lb />
			(reference to powers under Section 432 to 433A). The court has
			<lb />
			also noted with approval award of fixed term sentences by the
			<lb />
			sentencing court whereby release on exercise of powers of
			<lb />
			remission stands interdicted.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			155. It needs no elaboration that it is the pronouncement by the
			<lb />
			larger Bench in Swamy Shraddananda (2) on the issue which has
			<lb />
			to bind adjudication.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			156. We may also consider the formulation by the Division
			<lb />
			Bench of this court on the above principles with regard to the third
			<lb />
			category of cases in the judgment reported at (2009) VIII AD
			<lb />
			(Delhi) 262, State v. Shree Gopal @ Mani Gopal. The Trial Court
			<lb />
			had imposed the penalty of death on the respondent which was
			<lb />
			referred to the High Court for confirmation. This court imposed an
			<lb />
			actual sentence of 20 years without remission on the respondent
			<lb />
			Shree Gopal. The court considered several judgments on the issue
			<lb />
			and termed the just short of &apos;rarest of rare&apos; case as a &apos;rare&apos; case in the
			<lb />
			following terms :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-43. We may only add that the said decisions throw
			<lb />
			light of drawing distinctions between what would be
			<lb />
			rare and what would be the rarest of the rare. A sentence
			<lb />
			of life imprisonment can thus be classified in two
			<lb />
			categories i.e. the ordinary category whereby the Court
			<lb />
			leaves the exercise of executive power at the discretion
			<lb />
			of the executive, to be so exercised after 14 years of
			<lb />
			imprisonment and grant remission; and a higher
			<lb />
			category, where the Court, in a rare case, but not the
			<lb />
			rarest of the rare, would clip said benefit being
			<lb />
			extended by directing that the accused shall undergo an
			<lb />
			actual sentence for a higher period or even for the
			<lb />
			remainder of his life. Such kinds of cases can be put in
			<lb />
			the category of rare cases with appropriate direction of
			<lb />
			not being entitled to the benefit of remission till a fixed
			<lb />
			term of imprisonment is undergone. Only after
			<lb />
			carrying out such an exercise should the Court take
			<lb />
			resort to the extreme action in a case which would be in
			<lb />
			the category of the rarest of the rare.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			157. The above jurisprudence would show that the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court has noted that on several occasions, while a murder may not
			<lb />
			fall in the rarest of rare category, it is just short of it, or, is certainly
			<lb />
			more serious than what has been termed as an &apos;ordinary murder
			<lb />
			case&apos;. The Supreme Court has thus categorized murder cases into
			<lb />
			‗ordinary&apos; and ‗rarest of rare&apos;. It has also recognized an in between
			<lb />
			category of just short of &apos;rarest of rare&apos; cases. Thus murder cases,
			<lb />
			for sentencing purposes can be classified into three categories -
			<lb />
			‗ordinary&apos;, ‗rarest of rare&apos; and a third category ‗just short of rarest
			<lb />
			of rare&apos; i.e. ‗rare&apos; category. The sentence of life imprisonment
			<lb />
			also is classified into two categories. The first is the ordinary
			<lb />
			category whereby the executive has the discretion to grant
			<lb />
			remission after 14 years of imprisonment. The courts have the
			<lb />
			jurisdiction, in a case falling &apos;just short of rarest of rare&apos; (or rare)
			<lb />
			category, to make an appropriate direction that the offender will
			<lb />
			not be entitled to the benefit of remission till he has undergone a
			<lb />
			fixed term of imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			158. Mr. Verma, learned counsel for Vikas Yadav, presses that a
			<lb />
			distinction be drawn between a case where a death sentence stands
			<lb />
			imposed and a challenge thereto is being considered, that too by no
			<lb />
			court other than the Supreme Court as against a case where the
			<lb />
			court is considering imposition of any appropriate sentence. The
			<lb />
			distinction being drawn by Mr. Verma, to say the least, is an
			<lb />
			erroneous reading of the jurisprudence on the issue. First and
			<lb />
			foremost, imposition of a minimum prison term would arise only in
			<lb />
			cases where life imprisonment is an option and the court formed a
			<lb />
			view that if the case was taken up for remission under Section 432
			<lb />
			in accordance with Section 433A of the Cr.P.C., the fourteen year
			<lb />
			imprisonment would not be commensurate with the gravity of the
			<lb />
			offence. This issue would also arise where the court is called upon
			<lb />
			to consider whether an offence of murder falls in the rarest of rare
			<lb />
			category or it does not.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			159. It has been categorically held in para 85 of (2010) 3 SCC
			<lb />
			508, Mulla v. State of U.P. that -it is open to the sentencing court
			<lb />
			to prescribe the length of incarceration‖. The Supreme Court
			<lb />
			further observed that this was -especially true in cases where
			<lb />
			death sentence has been replaced by life imprisonment. The
			<lb />
			court should be free to determine the length of imprisonment
			<lb />
			which will suffice the offence committed. In the case in hand, it
			<lb />
			was observed that despite the nature of the crime, the mitigating
			<lb />
			circumstances can allow us to substitute the death penalty with
			<lb />
			life imprisonment‖.
			<lb />
			The Supreme Court has thus clearly stated that the length of
			<lb />
			incarceration has to be fixed by the &quot;sentencing court&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			160. Will not the considerations for commuting death to life be
			<lb />
			the same when considering imposition of the sentence in an appeal
			<lb />
			for enhancement? Or for that matter, by the trial court when
			<lb />
			imposing the sentence upon returning the finding of guilt?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			161. It is essential to note that the first level of consideration of
			<lb />
			the aptness of the sentence is at the trial court. It is the trial judge
			<lb />
			who is required to hear the accused after pronouncing conviction,
			<lb />
			and conclude on the gravity of the offence and adequacy of the
			<lb />
			sentence. In a trial for offences punishable with death, it is the trial
			<lb />
			judge who would consider whether the case falls in the rarest of
			<lb />
			rare formulation and also whether a prison term is commensurate
			<lb />
			with the offence? The trial judge also has to examine the length of
			<lb />
			the prison term to befit the offence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			162. The parameters on which a case is evaluated from the
			<lb />
			perspective of whether the capital punishment is warranted,
			<lb />
			remains the same, be it any court in the country. It is also
			<lb />
			necessary to point out that there is no difference between the
			<lb />
			parameters on which the power to commute the death sentence to
			<lb />
			life imprisonment would be exercised by the Supreme Court or the
			<lb />
			High Court or in the scope of consideration while doing so.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			163. While examining the legality, proportionality and adequacy
			<lb />
			of the sentence, the consideration by the high court as the appellate
			<lb />
			court into the sentencing, has to remain the same. It would be
			<lb />
			preposterous to thus hold that the power to hand down a fixed term
			<lb />
			sentence beyond 14 years is not available to the trial courts or the
			<lb />
			high court or that even the power of the Supreme Court to do is
			<lb />
			confined to cases of commutation of the death sentence to life
			<lb />
			imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			164. The submission as pressed by learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			defendants would require us to hold that the trial court can impose
			<lb />
			a life sentence for an ordinary murder, the death sentence for the
			<lb />
			rarest of rare case but it has no jurisdiction to consider as to
			<lb />
			whether the case falls in the intermediate &apos;rare&apos; category inviting
			<lb />
			mandatory tenure imprisonment as an adequate sentence. Or that,
			<lb />
			on the same facts and evidence, the trial court (or for that matter,
			<lb />
			the high court) has no power to do so, and that only the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court has the jurisdiction to do so, which jurisdiction is also
			<lb />
			limited to when it is commuting a death sentence to life not to
			<lb />
			restrict power of the executive to remit the sentence. Such is not
			<lb />
			the legislative intent.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			165. There is no dichotomy between the power of the High Court
			<lb />
			when confirming a death sentence and its power when considering
			<lb />
			an appeal for enhancement under Section 377 read with Section
			<lb />
			386 of the Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			166. It is also important to note that as per Swamy Shraddananda
			<lb />
			(2), the third option is available to the &quot;convicting court&quot; (as
			<lb />
			recommended in Dalbir Singh) which is not only the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court but also the High Courts and the trial courts.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			167. We therefore, conclude that a third sentencing option is
			<lb />
			available to the sentencing court in all cases where death penalty is
			<lb />
			one of the options. It would be exercised if the court is of the view
			<lb />
			that death sentence ought not to be imposed and that, given the
			<lb />
			power of remission of the life sentence, if exercised on completion
			<lb />
			of fourteen years of imprisonment, the imprisonment would be
			<lb />
			inadequate. The court is therefore, free to determine the length of
			<lb />
			imprisonment which would be commensurate for the offence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			168. Mr. Sanjay Jain, learned counsel for Vishal Yadav has
			<lb />
			placed the pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (2011)
			<lb />
			10 SCC 259, A.B. Bhaskara Rao v. Inspector of Police, CBI
			<lb />
			Vishakapatnam; (2000) 1 SCC 278, M.S. Ahlawat v. State of
			<lb />
			Haryana &amp; Anr. ; (2001) 2 SCC 186, E.S.P. Rajaram &amp; Ors. v.
			<lb />
			Union of India &amp; Ors.; (1996) 4 SCC 453, Union of India &amp; Anr.
			<lb />
			v. Kirloskar Pneumatic Co. Ltd. to contend that every judgment
			<lb />
			has to be consistent with the relevant substantive provisions of the
			<lb />
			relevant statutory laws. In order to do complete justice, the order
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court cannot be inconsistent with the substantive
			<lb />
			provisions of the relevant statutory laws (Prem Chand Garg;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			E.S.P. Rajaram; M.S. Ahlawat)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			169. In para 101 of Kirloskar Pneumatic Co. Ltd. case, it was
			<lb />
			held that even under Article 226, no direction to act contrary to law
			<lb />
			can be given. There can be no dispute at all with this well settled
			<lb />
			principle. In fact, it is premised on this principle that we have held
			<lb />
			that the power to impose a fixed term sentence on the convict is
			<lb />
			derived from Section 28 of the Cr.P.C. The argument of the
			<lb />
			defence that the High Court cannot give such fixed tenure
			<lb />
			imprisonment sentence and the same is permissible only if the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court is commuting death sentence to life imprisonment
			<lb />
			is clearly contrary to this well settled principle.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			170. Thus the restriction on the power of the courts which Mr.
			<lb />
			Verma is pressing is unwarranted. It is not supported by either the
			<lb />
			statutory provisions or the judicial precedents. It is clearly
			<lb />
			permissible for the sentencing court to judicially regulate the power
			<lb />
			of the executive to remit the sentence of the convict and while
			<lb />
			imposing a life sentence, direct a minimum term of imprisonment
			<lb />
			which may be in excess of fourteen years imprisonment depriving
			<lb />
			the convict of the benefit of remissions till expiry of such period.
			<lb />
			It can also be lawfully awarded by the High Court while
			<lb />
			commuting the death sentence awarded by the trial court upon
			<lb />
			conviction for such offence. In the light of the above discussion,
			<lb />
			we also find no legal prohibition upon the high court in handing
			<lb />
			out such sentence when adjudicating upon a prayer for
			<lb />
			enhancement of the sentence by the prosecution or the
			<lb />
			complainant/victim.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			171. Mr. Sanjay Jain, learned counsel has also urged that the High
			<lb />
			Court does not have any power to interfere with the discharge of
			<lb />
			the executive function to grant remission. Mr. Rajesh Mahajan,
			<lb />
			learned Additional Standing Counsel has drawn our attention to
			<lb />
			paras 68, 72 and 91 of Swamy Shraddananda(2) as well as the
			<lb />
			pronouncements in Sahib Hussain @ Sahib Jain and Gurvail
			<lb />
			Singh @ Gala wherein similar doubts have been laid to rest.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			172. From the jurisprudence on the subject and statutory position,
			<lb />
			the alternate sentencing framework available to any sentencing
			<lb />
			court can be summed up thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			A convict sentenced to imprisonment for life will remain
			<lb />
			imprisoned for his entire life unless remission of the sentence in
			<lb />
			accordance with Section 433A CrPC is granted for good reasons,
			<lb />
			on an application by the convict. The convicting or confirming
			<lb />
			court retains the power to recommend to the government that the
			<lb />
			sentence be not remitted till a fixed term of imprisonment has been
			<lb />
			undergone or consideration of the remission be postponed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii) A prisoner serving a life sentence does not have an
			<lb />
			indefeasible right to release under Section 432 CrPC after serving
			<lb />
			out, either a 14 or 20 years of his prison term.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii) Before actually exercising the power of remission of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C., the appropriate government must obtain the opinion (with
			<lb />
			reasons) of the presiding Judge of the convicting or confirming
			<lb />
			court. The remissions, therefore, be given only on a case by case
			<lb />
			basis and not for a wholesale manner [Sangeet para 80(7)].
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv) The exercise of power of an appropriate government to
			<lb />
			curtail the duration of the life sentence thus has to be in the above
			<lb />
			manner and on the parameters laid down by the court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			V.
			<lb />
			Questions referred and pending before the Constitution
			<lb />
			Bench of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			173. The diverse views on the subject regarding the scope of
			<lb />
			statutory power of remission and the legality of the orders to
			<lb />
			commute the death penalty and imprisonment for life in some cases
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 133
			<lb />
			and deny remission in other cases is amongst the several questions
			<lb />
			which was considered by an order dated 25 th April, 2014 passed by
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court in W.P.(Crl.) No.48/2014, Union of India v. V.
			<lb />
			Sriharan @ Murugan and Ors. as well as the connected matters
			<lb />
			(reported at (2014) 5 SCALE 600).
			<lb />
			In this writ petition, the correctness of the views of the three
			<lb />
			Judge Bench in Swamy Shraddananda (2) v. State of
			<lb />
			Karnataka, (2008) 13 SCC 767 were doubted before the court. In
			<lb />
			this regard, in para 42 the court notes that it may not be appropriate
			<lb />
			for a three Judge Bench to examine and decide the correctness of
			<lb />
			the previous judgments and consequently refer the matter to a five
			<lb />
			Judge Bench to reconcile the dispute. The court was also of the
			<lb />
			view that the question as to whether after the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			commutes the death sentence to life imprisonment, when the
			<lb />
			executive exercises its remission power by the executive had wide
			<lb />
			ramifications and therefore placed this question as well before the
			<lb />
			Constitution Bench. In para 48, the following amongst other
			<lb />
			questions have been framed for consideration before the
			<lb />
			Constitution Bench :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;(i) Whether imprisonment for life in terms of
			<lb />
			Section 53 read with Section 45 of the Indian Penal Code
			<lb />
			meant imprisonment for rest of the life of the prisoner or a
			<lb />
			convict undergoing life imprisonment has a right to claim
			<lb />
			remission and whether as per the principles enunciated in
			<lb />
			paras 91 to 93 of Swamy Shraddananda (supra), a special
			<lb />
			category of sentence may be made for the very few cases
			<lb />
			where the death penalty might be substituted by the
			<lb />
			punishment of imprisonment for life or imprisonment for
			<lb />
			a term in excess of fourteen years and to put that category
			<lb />
			beyond application of remission?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) Whether the &quot;appropriate Government&quot; is permitted to
			<lb />
			exercise the power of remission Under Section 432/433 of
			<lb />
			the Code after the parallel power has been exercised by
			<lb />
			the President Under Article 72 or the Governor Under
			<lb />
			Article 161 or by this Court in its Constitutional power
			<lb />
			Under Article 32 as in this case?
			<lb />
			xxx xxx xxx
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(vi) Whether suo motu exercise of power of remission
			<lb />
			Under Section 432(1) is permissible in the scheme of the
			<lb />
			section if, yes whether the procedure prescribed in Sub-
			<lb />
			clause (2) of the same Section is mandatory or not?
			<lb />
			xxx xxxx xxx&quot;
			<lb />
			We note that these issues are pending consideration before
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court. It is noteworthy that there is no order by the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court interdicting the courts from passing any orders on
			<lb />
			sentence.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			174. Mr. Rajesh Mahajan has drawn our attention to the judgment
			<lb />
			dated 21st May, 2014 reported at 2014 (7) SCALE 571, Md.
			<lb />
			Jamuluddin Nasir v. State of West Bengal wherein, even after the
			<lb />
			reference, the Supreme Court has given a term imprisonment of 30
			<lb />
			years to one convict and of imprisonment till the end of his life to
			<lb />
			the other. Mr. Mahajan has also drawn our attention to the
			<lb />
			judgment of Supreme Court reported at 2014 (8) SCALE 113,
			<lb />
			Amar Singh Yadav v. State of U.P., decided on 1st July, 2014,
			<lb />
			wherein the Supreme Court has imposed a 30 year imprisonment
			<lb />
			sentence on the convict.
			<lb />
			There is therefore, as of now, no prohibition on this court to
			<lb />
			impose a fixed term sentence of imprisonment on the defendants.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			VI. If there are convictions for multiple offences in one case,
			<lb />
			does the court have the option of directing that the
			<lb />
			sentences imposed thereon shall run consecutively and not
			<lb />
			concurrently?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			175. An examination of the law and the jurisprudence on the
			<lb />
			subject of sentencing options shows that in a case involving
			<lb />
			multiple offences, there is one more option available to the court.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			A person may stand convicted for multiple offences in a single case
			<lb />
			and each conviction carries a separate sentence. How are the
			<lb />
			sentences to run? Is it permissible for the court to direct that all or
			<lb />
			some of the specified sentences would run consecutively?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			176. Again an absolute proposition is pressed by Mr. Sumeet
			<lb />
			Verma, learned counsel for Vikas Yadav to the effect that, upon
			<lb />
			conviction of a person for multiple offences in a single trial, if life
			<lb />
			imprisonment is one of the punishments imposed upon him, all
			<lb />
			other sentences of imprisonment have to run concurrently and that
			<lb />
			there is no option at all available to the court in the matter. Mr.
			<lb />
			Verma, submits that the court is barred from making a direction
			<lb />
			that the sentences would run consecutively by virtue of Section 31
			<lb />
			of the Cr.P.C. and the pronouncements of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			reported at (2006) 12 SCC 37 : 2006 (12) SCALE 381, Chatar
			<lb />
			Singh v. State of M.P.; (2012) 11 SCC 629, Ramesh Chilwal @
			<lb />
			Bambayya v. State of Uttarakhand and; 2014 SCC OnLine SC
			<lb />
			512 : 2014 (8) SCALE 96, Duryodhan Rout v. State of Orissa.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			177. This submission is opposed with some vehemence by both
			<lb />
			Mr. Rajesh Mahajan for the State as well as Mr. P.K. Dey, learned
			<lb />
			counsel for the complainant who submit that the argument of
			<lb />
			learned counsel on the other side rests on a mis-reading of both the
			<lb />
			statutory provisions as well as the judicial precedents on the
			<lb />
			subject.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			178. Mr. Rajesh Mahajan, learned Additional Standing Counsel
			<lb />
			for the State has contended that there is no such prohibition under
			<lb />
			Section 31 on the powers of the High Court or Sessions Court to
			<lb />
			direct that sentences of imprisonment shall run consecutively even
			<lb />
			in a case where life imprisonment is one of the sentences awarded
			<lb />
			to a convict. Mr. Mahajan and Mr. Dey have relied on the above
			<lb />
			statutory provision as well as several judicial precedents wherein
			<lb />
			the courts have even if cases where life sentence was one of the
			<lb />
			punishment directed that sentences would run consecutively.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			179. Before proceeding any further, we may at the outset extract
			<lb />
			Section 31 of the Cr.P.C. which reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;31. Sentence in cases of conviction of several
			<lb />
			offences at one trial.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(1) When a person is convicted at one trial of two or
			<lb />
			more offences, the court may, subject to the provisions
			<lb />
			of section 71 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860),
			<lb />
			sentence him for such offences, to the several
			<lb />
			punishments, prescribed therefor which such court is
			<lb />
			competent to inflict; such punishments when
			<lb />
			consisting of imprisonment to commence the one after
			<lb />
			the expiration of the other in such order as the court
			<lb />
			may direct, unless the court directs that such
			<lb />
			punishments shall run concurrently.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2) In the case of consecutive sentences, it shall not be
			<lb />
			necessary for the Court by reason only of the aggregate
			<lb />
			punishment for the several offences being in excess of
			<lb />
			the punishment, which it is competent to inflict on
			<lb />
			conviction of a single offence, to send the offender for
			<lb />
			trial before a higher court:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Provided that-
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(a) in no case shall such person be sentenced to
			<lb />
			imprisonment for a longer period than fourteen years;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(b) the aggregate punishment shall not exceed twice
			<lb />
			the amount of punishment, which the court is
			<lb />
			competent to inflict for a single offence.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(3) For the purpose of ‗appeal by a convicted person, the
			<lb />
			aggregate of the consecutive sentences passed against
			<lb />
			him under this section shall be deemed to be a single
			<lb />
			sentence.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			180. As per the legislative scheme, Section 31 has been placed in
			<lb />
			Chapter 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which is concerned
			<lb />
			with the &quot;Power of Courts&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			181. Let us firstly examine the law on the subject. Our attention
			<lb />
			has been drawn also to the pronouncement of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			reported at (1996) 9 SCC 287, Raja Ram Yadav &amp; Ors. v. State of
			<lb />
			Bihar wherein the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of the
			<lb />
			appellant for the offence of murder of six persons to take revenge
			<lb />
			of a carnage involving his kith and kin. The court commuted the
			<lb />
			death sentence of the appellants to the sentence of life
			<lb />
			imprisonment and additionally awarded the sentence of six years
			<lb />
			rigorous imprisonment to each of the appellants for the offence
			<lb />
			under Section 436 read with Section 149 as well as a composite
			<lb />
			fine of Rs.15,000/-against each of the appellants for the offences
			<lb />
			under Section 302 and 436 read with Section 149 of the IPC. It was
			<lb />
			further directed that &quot;the sentence of life imprisonment for the
			<lb />
			offence of murder and the sentence of six years rigorous
			<lb />
			imprisonment for the offence under Section 436 read with
			<lb />
			Section 149 IPC will run consecutively&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			182. In (2005) 5 SCC 194, Kamalanantha &amp; Ors. v. State of
			<lb />
			T.N., 13 girls of an ashram were raped by its founder, A-1, which
			<lb />
			rapes were systematically abetted by the co-accused. The victims
			<lb />
			were orphans entirely dependant on the founder. The conviction of
			<lb />
			A-1 under Section 376(2)(c) and sentence of life imprisonment
			<lb />
			with fine of Rs.5,10,000/-on each count to run separately and
			<lb />
			consecutively was found justified by the Supreme Court. Also the
			<lb />
			conviction of the co-accused under Section 376/106 and sentence
			<lb />
			of life imprisonment (except in the case of A-3 who was awarded
			<lb />
			R.I. for the period already undergone with fine of Rs.10,000/-) to
			<lb />
			run separately and consecutively was also upheld by the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court holding as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;76. The contention of Mr Jethmalani that the term
			<lb />
			-imprisonment‖ enjoined in Section 31 CrPC does not
			<lb />
			include imprisonment for life is unacceptable. The
			<lb />
			term -imprisonment‖ is not defined under the Code of
			<lb />
			Criminal Procedure. Section 31 of the Code falls under
			<lb />
			Chapter III of the Code which deals with power of
			<lb />
			courts. Section 28 of the Code empowers the High
			<lb />
			Court to pass any sentence authorised by law.
			<lb />
			Similarly, the Sessions Judge and Additional Sessions
			<lb />
			Judge may pass any sentence authorised by law, except
			<lb />
			the sentence of death which shall be subject to
			<lb />
			confirmation by the High Court. In our opinion the
			<lb />
			term -imprisonment‖ would include the sentence of
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			77. In the aforesaid facts and circumstances, we see no
			<lb />
			infirmity in the well-merited findings concurrently
			<lb />
			recorded by the two courts below, which do not warrant
			<lb />
			our interference. The appeals are, accordingly
			<lb />
			dismissed.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			78. Having regard to the amplitude of the gravity of the
			<lb />
			offence, perpetrated in an organised and systematic
			<lb />
			manner, the nature of the offence and its deleterious
			<lb />
			effects not only against the victims, but the civilised
			<lb />
			society at large, needs to be curbed by a strong judicial
			<lb />
			hand. We are inclined to confirm the sentence and
			<lb />
			conviction as recorded by the trial court and confirmed
			<lb />
			by the High Court. The order of the trial court that any
			<lb />
			remission of sentence or amnesty on any special
			<lb />
			occasions announced or to be announced either by the
			<lb />
			Central or the State Government shall not apply to the
			<lb />
			sentence and imprisonment imposed on all the
			<lb />
			accused, is also maintained.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			The Supreme Court has thus upheld the order of the trial
			<lb />
			court interdicting the benefit of any remissions which may be
			<lb />
			announced by the State.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			183. In yet another pronouncement reported at (2013) 2 SCC 479,
			<lb />
			Sandesh @ Sainath Kailash Abhang v. State of Maharashtra, the
			<lb />
			appellant stood convicted for causing of a grievous murder and a
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 140
			<lb />
			rape of the pregnant daughter-in-law of the deceased besides
			<lb />
			committing robbery. The convict was under the influence of
			<lb />
			alcohol at the time of the offence which was committed in a brutal
			<lb />
			manner. The trial court convicted the appellant under Sections
			<lb />
			302, 307, 394, 397 and 376(e) and awarded the death sentence for
			<lb />
			his conviction under Section 302 along with imprisonment
			<lb />
			sentences for his other crimes. The court was persuaded to hold
			<lb />
			that the appellant had entered the house of the deceased with the
			<lb />
			mind of committing robbery. He was drunk and therefore, may not
			<lb />
			have been exactly aware of the consequences of his acts in injuring
			<lb />
			the deceased and committing the offences on PW-2. For these
			<lb />
			reasons, while upholding the convictions of the appellant, the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court commuted the death sentence upon his conviction
			<lb />
			for murder to that of rigorous imprisonment of life. The sentences
			<lb />
			for the other convictions were maintained. It was also directed that
			<lb />
			the life imprisonment &quot;shall be for life and the sentences shall run
			<lb />
			consecutively&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			184. We may notice yet another pronouncement placed by Mr.
			<lb />
			Rajesh Mahajan, learned Additional Standing Counsel for the State
			<lb />
			which has been reported at (2013) 3 SCC 52 : (2013) 2 SCALE
			<lb />
			505, Sanaullah Khan v. State of Bihar. In this case, the appellant
			<lb />
			was found culpable for three offences of murder and was sentenced
			<lb />
			to death by the trial court. The Supreme Court however, found the
			<lb />
			evidence insufficient to establish the gravest case of the extreme
			<lb />
			culpability of the appellant. It also did not have the evidence to
			<lb />
			establish the circumstances of the appellant. Therefore, for each of
			<lb />
			the murders, he was sentenced to life imprisonment with the
			<lb />
			following directions:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;23. We have, however, sufficient evidence to establish
			<lb />
			the culpability of the appellant for three offences of
			<lb />
			murder as defined in Section 300 IPC, and for each of
			<lb />
			the three offences of murder, the appellant is liable
			<lb />
			under Section 302 IPC for imprisonment for life if not
			<lb />
			the extreme penalty of death. Section 31(1) CrPC
			<lb />
			provides that:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-31. (1) When a person is convicted at one trial of
			<lb />
			two or more offences, the court may, subject to
			<lb />
			the provisions of Section 71 of the Indian Penal
			<lb />
			Code (45 of 1860), sentence him for such
			<lb />
			offences, to the several punishments prescribed
			<lb />
			therefor which such court is competent to inflict;
			<lb />
			such
			<lb />
			punishments
			<lb />
			when
			<lb />
			consisting
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			imprisonment to commence the one after the
			<lb />
			expiration of the other in such order as the court
			<lb />
			may direct, unless the court directs that such
			<lb />
			punishments shall run concurrently.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Thus, Section 31(1) CrPC empowers the Court to
			<lb />
			inflict sentences of imprisonment for more than one
			<lb />
			offence to run either consecutively or concurrently. In
			<lb />
			Kamalanantha v. State of T.N. [(2005) 5 SCC 194 :
			<lb />
			2005 SCC (Cri) 1121] this Court has held that the term
			<lb />
			-imprisonment‖ in Section 31 CrPC includes the
			<lb />
			sentence for imprisonment for life. Considering the
			<lb />
			facts of this case, we are of the opinion that the
			<lb />
			appellant is liable under Section 302 IPC for
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life for each of the three offences of
			<lb />
			murder under Section 300 IPC and the
			<lb />
			imprisonments for life should not run concurrently but
			<lb />
			consecutively and such punishment of consecutive
			<lb />
			sentence of imprisonment for the triple murder
			<lb />
			committed by the appellant will serve the interest of
			<lb />
			justice.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			24. In the result, we maintain the conviction of the
			<lb />
			appellant for three offences of murder under Section
			<lb />
			302 IPC, but convert the sentence from death to
			<lb />
			sentence for rigorous imprisonment for life for each of
			<lb />
			the three offences of murder and direct that the
			<lb />
			sentences of imprisonment for life for the three
			<lb />
			offences will run consecutively and not concurrently.
			<lb />
			Thus, the appeals are allowed only on the question of
			<lb />
			sentence, and dismissed as regards conviction.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			185. It is important to note that the court has directed not mere
			<lb />
			imprisonment sentences, but three sentences -each for life
			<lb />
			imprisonment -to run consecutively. The effect would be that
			<lb />
			upon a favourable consideration of an application for remission of
			<lb />
			one sentence, the second life sentence would commence. Given
			<lb />
			the prohibition under Section 433A, the second application could at
			<lb />
			the earliest be made after 14 years of further imprisonment. If this
			<lb />
			was favourably considered, the third life imprisonment sentence
			<lb />
			would commence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			186. Mr. Mahajan has also drawn our attention to the
			<lb />
			pronouncement of the Supreme Court on sentence in the case
			<lb />
			reported at (2013) 5 SCC 546, Shankar Kisanrao Khade v. State
			<lb />
			of Maharashtra. This was a case where the appellant, a man of 52
			<lb />
			years was found guilty of murder by strangulation after repeated
			<lb />
			rape and sodomization of a minor girl of 11 years with intellectual
			<lb />
			disability. The Supreme Court discussed the entire case law
			<lb />
			including the several cases where term sentences have been
			<lb />
			imposed including several judicial precedents where sentences had
			<lb />
			been ordered to run consecutively.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			187. In para 2 of the judgment reported at (2013) 5 SCC 546,
			<lb />
			Shanker Kisanrao Khade v. State of Maharashtra, the legal
			<lb />
			history reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;2. xxx xxx xxx The Additional Sessions Court in
			<lb />
			Sessions Case No. 165 of 2006 convicted the first
			<lb />
			accused and sentenced him to death under Section 302
			<lb />
			IPC, subject to confirmation by the High Court and was
			<lb />
			also awarded imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of
			<lb />
			Rs 1000 in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment (for
			<lb />
			short -RI‖) for six months for offences under Section
			<lb />
			376 IPC, further seven years&apos; RI and to pay a fine of Rs
			<lb />
			500 in default to suffer RI for three months under
			<lb />
			Section 366-A IPC and five years&apos; RI and to pay a fine
			<lb />
			of Rs 500 in default to suffer RI for one month for the
			<lb />
			offences punishable under Section 363 IPC read with
			<lb />
			Section 34 IPC. The second accused, his wife, was
			<lb />
			convicted for the offences punishable under Section
			<lb />
			363-A read with Section 34 IPC and sentenced to suffer
			<lb />
			RI for five years and to pay a fine of Rs 500 in default
			<lb />
			and to suffer RI for one month. Accused 2 had already
			<lb />
			suffered the punishment, hence did not file any appeal
			<lb />
			against the order of the Sessions Judge. The accused
			<lb />
			preferred Criminal Appeal No. 512 of 2007 before the
			<lb />
			High Court and the Court heard the appeal along with
			<lb />
			Confirmation Case No. 1 of 2007. The High Court
			<lb />
			dismissed [State of Maharashtra v. Shankar, (2008) 6
			<lb />
			AIR Bom R 43] the appeal and the reference made by
			<lb />
			the Sessions Court was accepted and the death sentence
			<lb />
			was confirmed. The appellant has preferred these two
			<lb />
			appeals against those orders.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			After a detailed consideration, the court concluded that the
			<lb />
			case did not fall in the rarest of rare category and set aside the
			<lb />
			death sentence ordering as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;78. The criminal appeals stand dismissed and the death
			<lb />
			sentence awarded to the accused is converted to that of
			<lb />
			rigorous imprisonment for life and that all the sentences
			<lb />
			awarded will run consecutively.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			188. In Shankar Kisanrao Khade, while upholding the
			<lb />
			conviction of the appellant, the court had directed that the
			<lb />
			sentences of the appellant should run consecutively holding as
			<lb />
			follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Consecutive sentence cases
			<lb />
			138. Ravindra Trimbak Chouthmal v. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra [(1996) 4 SCC 148 : 1996 SCC (Cri)
			<lb />
			608], is perhaps among the earliest cases where
			<lb />
			consecutive sentences were awarded. This was not a
			<lb />
			case of rape and murder but one of causing a dowry
			<lb />
			death of his pregnant wife. It was held that it was not the
			<lb />
			-rarest of rare‖ cases -because dowry death has ceased
			<lb />
			to belong to that species of killing‖. The death sentence
			<lb />
			was, therefore, not upheld. Since the accused had
			<lb />
			attempted to cause disappearance of the evidence by
			<lb />
			severing the head and cutting the body into nine pieces,
			<lb />
			this Court directed that he should undergo the
			<lb />
			sentence for that crime after serving out his life
			<lb />
			sentence. It was held: (SCC p. 151, paras 10-12)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-10. We have given considered thought to the
			<lb />
			question and we have not been able to place the
			<lb />
			case in that category which could be regarded as
			<lb />
			the ‗rarest of the rare&apos; type. This is so because
			<lb />
			dowry death has ceased to belong to that species
			<lb />
			of killing. The increasing number of dowry deaths
			<lb />
			would bear this. To halt the rising graph, we, at
			<lb />
			one point, thought to maintain the sentence; but
			<lb />
			we entertain doubt about the deterrent effect of a
			<lb />
			death penalty. We, therefore, resist ourselves
			<lb />
			from upholding the death sentence, much though
			<lb />
			we would have desired annihilation of a
			<lb />
			despicable character like the appellant before us.
			<lb />
			We, therefore, commute the sentence of death to
			<lb />
			one of RI for life.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			11. But then, it is a fit case, according to us,
			<lb />
			where, for the offence under Sections 201/34, the
			<lb />
			sentence awarded, which is RI for seven years
			<lb />
			being the maximum for a case of the present
			<lb />
			type, should be sustained, in view of what had
			<lb />
			been done to cause disappearance of the evidence
			<lb />
			relating to the commission of murder-the
			<lb />
			atrocious way in which the head was severed and
			<lb />
			the body was cut in nine pieces. These cry for
			<lb />
			maximum sentence. Not only this, the sentence
			<lb />
			has to run consecutively, and not concurrently,
			<lb />
			to show our strong disapproval of the loathsome,
			<lb />
			revolting and dreaded device adopted to cause
			<lb />
			disappearance of the dead body. To these
			<lb />
			sentences, we do not, however, desire to add
			<lb />
			those awarded for offences under Sections 316
			<lb />
			and 498-A/34, as killing of the child in the womb
			<lb />
			was not separately intended, and Section 498-A
			<lb />
			offence ceases to be of significance and
			<lb />
			importance in view of the murder of Vijaya.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			12. The result is that the appeal stands allowed to
			<lb />
			the extent that the sentence of death is converted
			<lb />
			to one of imprisonment for life. But then, the
			<lb />
			sentence of seven years&apos; RI for the offence
			<lb />
			under Sections 201/34 IPC would start running
			<lb />
			after the life imprisonment has run its course as
			<lb />
			per law.‖
			<lb />
			(emphasis in original)
			<lb />
			Since imprisonment for life means that the convict will
			<lb />
			remain in jail till the end of his normal life, what this
			<lb />
			decision mandates is that if the convict is to be
			<lb />
			released earlier by the competent authority for any
			<lb />
			reason, in accordance with procedure established by
			<lb />
			law, then the second sentence will commence
			<lb />
			immediately thereafter.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			139. Ronny v. State of Maharashtra [(1998) 3 SCC
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			625 : 1998 SCC (Cri) 859] is also among the earliest
			<lb />
			cases in the recent past where consecutive sentences
			<lb />
			were awarded. The three accused, aged about 35 years
			<lb />
			(two of them) and 25/27 years had committed three
			<lb />
			murders and a gang rape. This Court converted the
			<lb />
			death sentence of all three to imprisonment for life since
			<lb />
			it was not possible to identify whose case would fall in
			<lb />
			the category of the -rarest of rare‖ cases. However, after
			<lb />
			awarding a sentence of life imprisonment, this Court
			<lb />
			directed that they would all undergo punishment for the
			<lb />
			offence punishable under Section 376(2)(g) IPC
			<lb />
			consecutively, after serving the sentences for other
			<lb />
			offences. It was held: (SCC p. 654, para 47)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-47. Considering the cumulative effect of all the
			<lb />
			factors, it cannot be said that the offences were
			<lb />
			committed under the influence of extreme mental
			<lb />
			or emotional disturbance for the whole thing was
			<lb />
			done in a pre-planned way; having regard to the
			<lb />
			nature of offences and circumstances in which
			<lb />
			they were committed, it is not possible for the
			<lb />
			Court to predict that the appellant would not
			<lb />
			commit criminal act of violence or would not be a
			<lb />
			threat to the society. A-1 is 35 years old, A-2 is
			<lb />
			35 years old and A-3 is 25 (sic 27) years old. The
			<lb />
			appellants cannot be said to be too young or too
			<lb />
			old. The possibility of reform and rehabilitation,
			<lb />
			however, cannot be ruled out. From the facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances, it is not possible to predict as to
			<lb />
			who among the three played which part. It may
			<lb />
			be that the role of one has been more culpable in
			<lb />
			degree than that of the others and vice versa.
			<lb />
			Where in a case like this it is not possible to say
			<lb />
			as to whose case falls within the ‗rarest of the
			<lb />
			rare&apos; cases, it would serve the ends of justice if
			<lb />
			the capital punishment is commuted into life
			<lb />
			imprisonment. Accordingly, we modify the
			<lb />
			sentence awarded by the courts below under
			<lb />
			Section 302 read with Section 34 from death to
			<lb />
			life imprisonment. The sentences for the
			<lb />
			offences for which the appellants are convicted,
			<lb />
			except under Section 376(2)(g) IPC, shall run
			<lb />
			concurrently; they shall serve sentence under
			<lb />
			Section 376(2)(g) IPC consecutively, after
			<lb />
			serving sentence for the other offences.&quot;

			<lb />
			been seriously reconsidering, though not in a systemic
			<lb />
			manner, awarding life sentence as an alternative to death
			<lb />
			penalty by applying (though not necessarily mentioning)
			<lb />
			the -unquestionably foreclosed‖ formula laid down
			<lb />
			in Bachan Singh [Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab,

			189. The Supreme Court has expressed grave concern about the
			<lb />
			exercise of power of remission or commutation of the life
			<lb />
			sentences in very serious offences resulting in serious offenders
			<lb />
			being set at liberty after incarceration of 14 years which was
			<lb />
			grossly inadequate when balanced against the nature of the crime.
			<lb />
			In (2013) 10 SCC 721 : 2013 (12) SCALE 200, State of Rajasthan
			<lb />
			v. Jamil Khan, the High Court declined to confirm the death
			<lb />
			sentence imposed by the trial court and instead the respondent had
			<lb />
			been awarded life imprisonment under Section 302 of the IPC. For
			<lb />
			his conviction under Section 376 of the IPC, he had been awarded
			<lb />
			life imprisonment while the third substantive sentence of
			<lb />
			imprisonment of three years and fine of Rs.500/-awarded by the
			<lb />
			Sessions Court under Section 201 of the IPC which were
			<lb />
			maintained by the High Court. The sentences had been ordered to
			<lb />
			run concurrently. The Supreme Court had observed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;35. xxx The sentence of life imprisonment is till the
			<lb />
			end of one&apos;s biological life. However, in view of the
			<lb />
			power of the State under Sections 432 and 433 CrPC,
			<lb />
			in the present case, we are of the view that the
			<lb />
			sentences shall run consecutively, in case there is
			<lb />
			remission or commutation. We further make it clear
			<lb />
			that the remission or commutation, if considered in the
			<lb />
			case of the respondent, shall be granted only after the
			<lb />
			mandatory period of fourteen years in the case of
			<lb />
			offence under Section 302 IPC.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			36. Section 433-A CrPC has imposed a restriction with
			<lb />
			regard to the period of remission or commutation. It is
			<lb />
			specifically provided that when a sentence of
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life, where death is also one of the
			<lb />
			punishments provided by law, is remitted or commuted,
			<lb />
			such person shall not be released unless he has served at
			<lb />
			least fourteen years of imprisonment. In the case of the
			<lb />
			respondent herein, second life imprisonment is under
			<lb />
			Section 376(2) IPC. A minimum sentence under
			<lb />
			Section 376(1) IPC is seven years. Death is not an
			<lb />
			alternate punishment. However, the sentence may even
			<lb />
			be for life or for a term which may extend to ten years.
			<lb />
			Of the three options thus available, in view of the brutal
			<lb />
			rape of a minor girl child, the Sessions Court has chosen
			<lb />
			to impose the extreme punishment of life imprisonment
			<lb />
			on the respondent.
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			37. Punishment has a penological purpose. Reformation,
			<lb />
			retribution, prevention, deterrence are some of the major
			<lb />
			factors in that regard. Parliament is the collective
			<lb />
			conscience of the people. If it has mandated a minimum
			<lb />
			sentence for certain offences, the Government being its
			<lb />
			delegate, cannot interfere with the same in exercise of
			<lb />
			their power for remission or commutation. Neither
			<lb />
			Section 432 nor Section 433 CrPC hence contains a non
			<lb />
			obstante provision. Therefore, the minimum sentence
			<lb />
			provided for any offence cannot be and shall not be
			<lb />
			remitted or commuted by the Government in exercise of
			<lb />
			their power under Section 432 or 433 CrPC. Wherever
			<lb />
			the Penal Code or such penal statutes have provided for
			<lb />
			a minimum sentence for any offence, to that extent, the
			<lb />
			power of remission or commutation has to be read as
			<lb />
			restricted: otherwise the whole purpose of punishment
			<lb />
			will be defeated and it will be a mockery on sentencing.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			38. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of
			<lb />
			the present case, we make it clear that in the event of
			<lb />
			the State invoking its powers under Section 432 or 433
			<lb />
			CrPC, the sentence under Section 376(2) IPC shall not
			<lb />
			be remitted or commuted before ten years of
			<lb />
			imprisonment. In other words, in that eventuality, it
			<lb />
			shall be ensured that the respondent will first serve the
			<lb />
			term of life imprisonment under Section 302 IPC. In
			<lb />
			case there is any remission after fourteen years, then
			<lb />
			imprisonment for a minimum period of ten years
			<lb />
			under Section 376(2) IPC shall follow and thereafter
			<lb />
			three years of rigorous imprisonment under Section
			<lb />
			201 IPC. The sentence on fine and default as awarded
			<lb />
			by the Sessions Court are maintained as such.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
			In this case, the Supreme Court clearly declared that in case
			<lb />
			the Executive exercises its power under Section 432 or 433 of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C., and grants remission in the sentence of life imprisonment,
			<lb />
			the other sentences would run consecutively.

			<lb />
			imprisonment for the offence under Section 302 IPC. He was
			<lb />
			sentenced to imprisonment of 7 years for the conviction for the
			<lb />
			offence under Section 307 IPC. In para 30, it was however,
			<lb />
			clarified that &quot;in case the sentence of imprisonment for life is
			<lb />
			remitted or commuted to any specified period (in any case, not
			<lb />
			less than fourteen years in view of Section 433-A Cr.P.C.), the
			<lb />
			sentence of imprisonment under Section 307 IPC shall
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Mr. Sumeet Verma, Advocate. In this case, the learned trial judge
			<lb />
			convicted the appellant for commission of offences punishable
			<lb />
			under Sections 364 and 365 read with Sections 120B and 201 of
			<lb />
			the IPC imposing the following sentences:

			sentence, but it was observed: (SCC p. 229, para 75)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-75. Regarding the sentence, the trial court
			<lb />
			resorted to Section 31 CrPC and ordered the
			<lb />
			sentence to run consecutively, subject to proviso
			<lb />
			(a) of the said section.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			9. Although, the power of the court to impose
			<lb />
			consecutive sentence under Section 31 of the Criminal
			<lb />
			Procedure Code was also noticed by a Constitution
			<lb />
			Bench of this Court in K. Prabhakaran v. P.
			<lb />
			Jayarajan [(2005) 1 SCC 754 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 451] ,
			<lb />
			but, therein the question of construing proviso appended
			<lb />
			thereto did not and could not have fallen for
			<lb />
			consideration.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			10. The question, however, came up for consideration
			<lb />
			in Zulfiwar Ali v. State of U.P. [1986 All LJ 1177 :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(1986) 3 Crimes 199] wherein it was held: (All LJ p.
			<lb />
			1181, para 25)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-25. The opening words ‗In the case of
			<lb />
			consecutive sentences&apos; in sub-section (2) of
			<lb />
			Section 31 make it clear that this sub-section
			<lb />
			refers to a case in which ‗consecutive sentences&apos;
			<lb />
			are ordered. After providing that in such a case if
			<lb />
			an aggregate of punishment for several offences is
			<lb />
			found to be in excess of punishment which the
			<lb />
			court is competent to inflict on a conviction of
			<lb />
			single offence, it shall not be necessary for the
			<lb />
			court to send the offender for trial before a higher
			<lb />
			court. After making such a provision, proviso (a)
			<lb />
			is added to this sub-section to limit the aggregate
			<lb />
			of sentences which such a court pass while
			<lb />
			making the sentences consecutive. That is this
			<lb />
			proviso has provided that in no case the aggregate
			<lb />
			of consecutive sentences passed against an
			<lb />
			accused shall exceed 14 years. In the instant case
			<lb />
			the aggregate of the two sentences passed against
			<lb />
			the appellant being 28 years clearly infringes the
			<lb />
			above proviso. It is accordingly not liable to be
			<lb />
			sustained.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			11. In view of the proviso appended to Section 31 of the
			<lb />
			Criminal Procedure Code, we are of the opinion that the
			<lb />
			High Court committed a manifest error in sentencing the
			<lb />
			appellant for 20 years&apos; rigorous imprisonment. The
			<lb />
			maximum sentence imposable being 14 years and
			<lb />
			having regard to the fact that the appellant is in custody
			<lb />
			for more than 12 years. Now, we are of the opinion that
			<lb />
			interest of justice would be subserved if the appellant is
			<lb />
			directed to be sentenced to the period already
			<lb />
			undergone.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			192. The pronouncement of the Supreme Court in (2005) 1 SCC
			<lb />
			754, K. Prabhakaran v. P. Jayarajan [referred to in para 9 of
			<lb />
			Chatar Singh] was concerned with the date of election and
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 153
			<lb />
			scrutiny of nomination under the Representation of People Act,
			<lb />
			1951 in the context of fixation of the date by reference to which the
			<lb />
			disqualifications under Sections 8(1)(2) and (3) of the said Act is to
			<lb />
			be considered. As noted by the Supreme Court as well, no
			<lb />
			question of construing the proviso to Section 31 arose therein.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			193. So far as the pronouncement of the Allahabad High Court
			<lb />
			reported at 1986 All. LJ 1177 : (1986) 3 Crimes 199, Zulfiqar Ali
			<lb />
			&amp; Anr. v. State of U.P. [referred to in para 10 of Chatar Singh] is
			<lb />
			concerned, this was also not a case involving imposition of life
			<lb />
			imprisonment. Upon conviction, the appellants in this case had
			<lb />
			been sentenced by the Sessions Judge to 14 years rigorous
			<lb />
			imprisonment under Section 120B of the IPC; to another term of 14
			<lb />
			years rigorous imprisonment under Section 3 of the Official Secrets
			<lb />
			Act. The Sessions Judge had directed that the sentences of the
			<lb />
			appellants shall run consecutively. The appellants did not assail the
			<lb />
			findings of the Trial Court. They however, urged that the offences
			<lb />
			proved against them did not warrant the maximum sentences for
			<lb />
			offences for which they had been convicted and that, in any case,
			<lb />
			the sentences ought not to have been directed to run consecutively
			<lb />
			when the result of such a direction is that the appellant&apos;s sentence
			<lb />
			of imprisonment exceeds 14 years rigorous imprisonment which is
			<lb />
			the longest period of imprisonment for a person for any offence. In
			<lb />
			para 13 of Zulfiqar Ali, the court observed that -it is no doubt true
			<lb />
			that the normal rule for punishment as provided in Section 31(1) is
			<lb />
			that the sentences should run consecutively but it is also provided
			<lb />
			in Section 31(1) itself that in appropriate cases it can be made
			<lb />
			concurrent&quot;. The Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court
			<lb />
			extracted Section 31 (1) and observed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-13. xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			The Words -unless the Court directs that such
			<lb />
			punishment shall run concurrently‖ occur in the Section
			<lb />
			for some object. These words clearly indicate that the
			<lb />
			punishments can be directed to run concurrently in an
			<lb />
			appropriate case. In other words, there may be a case
			<lb />
			where only concurrent punishments can meet the ends of
			<lb />
			justice. Therefore, it has to be examined in this case
			<lb />
			whether on the facts proved in the case, concurrent
			<lb />
			punishment is called for. If once it is concluded that this
			<lb />
			case warrants concurrent punishments, the order of the
			<lb />
			trial Judge directing the punishments to be consecutive
			<lb />
			cannot be upheld.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
			It is noteworthy that the Allahabad High Court held that
			<lb />
			evaluation of the facts of the case had to be undertaken to conclude
			<lb />
			whether the sentences should run concurrently. The court also did
			<lb />
			not consider any precedent in which life imprisonment had been
			<lb />
			awarded.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			194. So far as the present consideration is concerned, the
			<lb />
			submission on behalf of the State in para 20 and the findings of the
			<lb />
			court in paras 21 and 22 of Zulfiqar Ali deserve to be extracted
			<lb />
			and read as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-20. It has been urged in this connection that proviso
			<lb />
			(a) is appended to sub-section (2) of Section 31, and
			<lb />
			therefore, it will not govern the provisions of sub section
			<lb />
			(1) of Section 31 which contains the normal rule that the
			<lb />
			sentences should be consecutive. Since this sub-section
			<lb />
			does not prescribe any maximum term of imprisonment
			<lb />
			that can be passed in a trial, a proviso appended to sub-
			<lb />
			section (2) will not govern this sub-section.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			21. We do not subscribe to the above view. Sub-
			<lb />
			section (1) of Section 31 no doubt says that the sentences
			<lb />
			should normally be consecutive but it has further
			<lb />
			provided that in appropriate cases the sentences may be
			<lb />
			made to run concurrently. The object of this sub-section
			<lb />
			is clearly to emphasise that the court must expressly
			<lb />
			direct whether the sentences awarded in a trial are to run
			<lb />
			concurrently or consecutively. This has been emphasized
			<lb />
			by providing that normally the sentences should be made
			<lb />
			to run consecutively and they may be made to run
			<lb />
			concurrently only if there is a reason for giving such a
			<lb />
			direction. By making such a provision, this sub-section
			<lb />
			has not provided any maximum term of punishment
			<lb />
			when the court directs the sentences to run consecutively.
			<lb />
			This is, as seen below, is provided in the following sub-
			<lb />
			section (2).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			22. The opening words -In the case of consecutive
			<lb />
			sentences‖ in sub-section 31(2) make it clear that this
			<lb />
			sub-section refers to a case in which -consecutive
			<lb />
			sentences‖ are ordered. After providing that in such a
			<lb />
			case if an aggregate of punishment for several offences is
			<lb />
			found to be in excess of punishment which the Court is
			<lb />
			competent to inflict on a conviction of single offence, it
			<lb />
			shall not be necessary for the Court to send the offender
			<lb />
			for trial before a higher Court. After making such a
			<lb />
			provision, proviso (a) is added to this sub-section to limit
			<lb />
			the aggregate of sentences which such a Court passes
			<lb />
			while making the sentences consecutive. That is this
			<lb />
			proviso has provided that in no case the aggregate of
			<lb />
			consecutive sentences passes against an accused shall
			<lb />
			exceed 14 years. In the instant case the aggregate of the
			<lb />
			two sentences passed against the appellant being 28 years
			<lb />
			clearly infringes the above proviso. It is accordingly not
			<lb />
			liable to be sustained.‖

			<lb />
			195. The competency of a court to award sentences is governed
			<lb />
			by clear statutory provisions which cannot be ignored. We are
			<lb />
			compelled to point out that unfortunately in both Chatar Singh and
			<lb />
			Zulfikar Ali, a primary submission that sub-section 2 of Section 31
			<lb />
			was restricted in its applicability to courts with limited
			<lb />
			competency, that is to say, that Section 31(2) refers to a sentencing
			<lb />
			court which is not competent to impose life imprisonment (which
			<lb />
			means that the remainder of the person&apos;s life and therefore, has no
			<lb />
			outside limits), was not placed before the court. In Zulfikar Ali,
			<lb />
			the court had proceeded to hold that it was not just and appropriate
			<lb />
			that the sentences be made to run consecutively in the facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of the case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			196. In the other judgment reported at (2012) 11 SCC 629,
			<lb />
			Ramesh Chilwal @ Bambayya v. State of Uttarakhand also placed
			<lb />
			by Mr. Sumeet Verma before us, the appellant stood convicted for
			<lb />
			commission of offences under Section 302 IPC; Sections 2/3[3(1)]
			<lb />
			of the Gangsters Act and Section 27 of the Arms Act. For the
			<lb />
			conviction under Section 302 IPC, he was sentenced to rigorous
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life and fine; for the conviction under the
			<lb />
			Gangsters Act to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and fine and
			<lb />
			for the conviction under Section 27 of the Arms Act, he was
			<lb />
			sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 7 years and fine. The
			<lb />
			Supreme Court issued notice in the appeal confined to whether the
			<lb />
			sentences were to run concurrently. It was in this context, it
			<lb />
			directed that -the trial judge has awarded life sentence for an
			<lb />
			offence under Section 302, in view of Section 31 of the Code of
			<lb />
			Criminal Procedure, 1973, we make it clear that all the sentences
			<lb />
			imposed under IPC, the Gangsters Act and the Arms Act are to run
			<lb />
			concurrently‖. The Supreme Court has therefore, reiterated the
			<lb />
			principle that life imprisonment means remainder of a person&apos;s life.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			197. The pronouncement reported at (2014) 2 SCC 153 (D.O.D.
			<lb />
			9 th December, 2013) Manoj @ Panu v. State of Haryana has also
			<lb />
			been placed before us to buttress the arguments of Mr. Verma on
			<lb />
			the permissibility of consecutive running of sentences upon
			<lb />
			convictions for offences under Section 307 IPC as well as Sections
			<lb />
			25 and 27 of the Arms Act. For the offence under Section 307, the
			<lb />
			appellant was sentenced to R.I. of 10 years and fine of Rs.5,000/-;
			<lb />
			under Section 25 of the Arms Act to R.I. for three years and fine
			<lb />
			and under Section 27 to R.I. of three years and fine of Rs.2,000/-.
			<lb />
			The sentences were ordered to run consecutively on the ground that
			<lb />
			the appellant was a previous convict for committing an identical
			<lb />
			offence and that in the present case, he had committed the heinous
			<lb />
			crime of shooting in court premises. The appellant&apos;s appeal against
			<lb />
			conviction and sentence was dismissed by the High Court. In the
			<lb />
			appeal before the Supreme Court, learned senior counsel for the
			<lb />
			appellant placed reliance on the pronouncements reported at (2006)
			<lb />
			12 SCC 37, Chatar Singh v. State of M.P.; (1988) 4 SCC 183,
			<lb />
			Mohd. Akhtar Hussain v. Collector of Customs and (2009) 5 SCC
			<lb />
			238, State of Punjab v. Madan Lal and drew the attention of the
			<lb />
			court to the tender age of the appellant to contend that as per the
			<lb />
			law laid down in these judgments, the punishment and sentence for
			<lb />
			the offences under the single transaction should have run
			<lb />
			concurrently and that the consecutive sentences awarded in the
			<lb />
			present case were disproportionate to the facts of the case. The
			<lb />
			Supreme Court accepted this submission of learned senior counsel
			<lb />
			for the appellant observing in para 14 as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;14. xxx xxx In view of the aforesaid legal position laid
			<lb />
			down by this Court regarding concurrent and
			<lb />
			consecutive sentences, the sentences imposed upon the
			<lb />
			appellant for different offences to run consecutively
			<lb />
			under IPC and the Arms Act, is erroneous in law, as the
			<lb />
			same is contrary to law laid down by this Court as per
			<lb />
			the cases referred to supra upon which reliance has been
			<lb />
			rightly placed by the learned Senior Counsel on behalf
			<lb />
			of the appellant.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			15. Further, having regard to the age of the appellant at
			<lb />
			the time of committing the offences, we feel it would
			<lb />
			not be just and proper to allow the sentences to run
			<lb />
			consecutively. As the offences committed by the
			<lb />
			appellant have been committed under a single
			<lb />
			transaction, it is well-settled position of law that the
			<lb />
			sentences must run concurrently and not consecutively.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			16. Hence, the appellant is entitled to the relief as
			<lb />
			prayed for in this case and the sentences are modified to
			<lb />
			run concurrently and not consecutively and for this
			<lb />
			reason, we hold that the sentence must be reduced to 10
			<lb />
			years in total with regard to the aforesaid settled
			<lb />
			position of law, as also keeping in view the tender age
			<lb />
			of the appellant on the date of the offence.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Underlining by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			198. Mr. Sumeet Verma has lastly placed the pronouncement of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court at 2014 SCC OnLine SC 512 : 2014 (8)
			<lb />
			SCALE 96, Duryodhan Rout v. State of Orissa in support of his
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 159
			<lb />
			submission that it is impermissible to direct sentences to run
			<lb />
			consecutively. The trial court had found the appellant guilty for
			<lb />
			commission of offences under Section 376(f)/302/201 IPC. He
			<lb />
			was sentenced to death for the offence punishable under Section
			<lb />
			302 IPC; to undergo R.I. for 10 years and fine of Rs.5,000/-for the
			<lb />
			offence under Section 376(f) and R.I. for one year and fine of
			<lb />
			Rs.1,000/-for commission of the offence punishable under Section
			<lb />
			201 of the IPC. The High Court of Orissa in the appeal and death
			<lb />
			reference, upheld the conviction. So far as the sentences were
			<lb />
			concerned, the High Court commuted the capital sentence to life
			<lb />
			imprisonment under Section 302 of the IPC while rest of the
			<lb />
			sentences were maintained. The High Court also maintained the
			<lb />
			direction of the trial court that the substantive sentences would run
			<lb />
			consecutively. In para 11, the Supreme Court framed the question
			<lb />
			as to whether the judgment of the trial court, as affirmed by the
			<lb />
			High Court, that the sentences were to run consecutively was
			<lb />
			contrary to the proviso to Sub-Section 2 of Section 31 of the Code
			<lb />
			of Criminal Procedure? The Supreme Court placed reliance on
			<lb />
			several pronouncements holding that a person sentenced to life
			<lb />
			imprisonment is bound to serve the remainder of his life in prison
			<lb />
			unless the sentences commuted by the appropriate government in
			<lb />
			terms of Sections 55, 433 and 433A of the Code of Criminal
			<lb />
			Procedure. Thereafter the court construed Section 31 of the Cr.P.C
			<lb />
			as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;27. Section 31 of Cr.P.C. relates to sentence in cases of
			<lb />
			conviction of several offences at one trial. Proviso to
			<lb />
			Sub Section (2) to Section 31 lays down the embargo
			<lb />
			whether the aggregate punishment of prisoner is for a
			<lb />
			period of longer than 14 years. In view of the fact that
			<lb />
			life imprisonment means imprisonment for full and
			<lb />
			complete span of life, the question of consecutive
			<lb />
			sentences in case of conviction for several offences at
			<lb />
			one trial does not arise. Therefore, in case a person is
			<lb />
			sentenced of conviction of several offences, including
			<lb />
			one that of life imprisonment, the proviso to Section
			<lb />
			31(2) shall come into play and no consecutive sentence
			<lb />
			can be imposed.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Underlining supplied)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			199. In para 28, 29 and 30, the Supreme Court noted the above
			<lb />
			extracted pronouncements in Kamalanantha &amp; Ors.; Chatar
			<lb />
			Singh and Ramesh Chilwal. The Supreme Court has noted that a
			<lb />
			sentence of imprisonment for life means a sentence for the entire
			<lb />
			life of the prisoner. One of the sentences handed down to the
			<lb />
			appellant was life imprisonment. It was consequently held that in
			<lb />
			view of the above discussions and decisions, the trial court was not
			<lb />
			justified in imposing consecutive sentences and that the High Court
			<lb />
			also failed to address the issue. It is noteworthy that in Chatar
			<lb />
			Singh, the Supreme Court was not considering award of
			<lb />
			punishment of life sentence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			200. We find that the issue raised before us was referred to a three
			<lb />
			Judge Bench of the Supreme Court of India in Crl.A.No.2387/2014
			<lb />
			(arising out of SLP(Crl.)No.2487/2014, O.M. Cherian @
			<lb />
			Thankachan v. State of Kerala &amp; Ors.). The Bench considered the
			<lb />
			question as to whether the sentences running consecutively is the
			<lb />
			rule, unless the court directs that they will run concurrently. The
			<lb />
			judgment was rendered on 11 th November, 2014. In this case, upon
			<lb />
			conviction, the appellant was sentenced under Section 498A IPC to
			<lb />
			undergo two years rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs.5,000/-as
			<lb />
			well as for the offence under Section 306 IPC, to undergo rigorous
			<lb />
			imprisonment for 7 years and to pay fine of Rs.50,000/-. The Trial
			<lb />
			Court had directed the substantive sentences of the appellant to run
			<lb />
			consecutively. Notice in the appeal was issued limited to the
			<lb />
			question as to whether the sentence can be made to run
			<lb />
			concurrently instead of running consecutively. In the referral order
			<lb />
			dated 18 th July, 2014, it was observed by the two Judge Bench that
			<lb />
			Section 31 of the Cr.P.C. was not noticed in its prior judgment
			<lb />
			reported at (1988) 4 SCC 183, Mohd. Akhtar Hussain @ Ibrahim
			<lb />
			Ahmed Bhatti v. Asstt. Collector of Customs (Prevention)
			<lb />
			Ahmedabad &amp; Anr. Consequently, this question was referred for
			<lb />
			consideration to a larger bench in order to settle the law. It appears
			<lb />
			that apart from the judgment in Mohd. Akhtar Hussain @ Ibrahim
			<lb />
			Ahmed Bhatti, the appellant was placing reliance on the judgment
			<lb />
			reported at (2014) 2 SCC 153, Manoj @ Panu v. State of
			<lb />
			Haryana. In the referral order dated 18 th July, 2014, Section 31(1)
			<lb />
			of the Cr.P.C. was extracted and the court had observed that the
			<lb />
			-statutory stipulation is clear that normally sentences in such
			<lb />
			cases are to run consecutively. Hence we find it difficult for us to
			<lb />
			accept the statement of law made in the above mentioned two
			<lb />
			cases‖. The matter was therefore, placed before the larger bench
			<lb />
			which has passed the judgment dated 11 th November, 2014. So far
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 162
			<lb />
			as sentences other than life sentence are concerned, the court held
			<lb />
			as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			-Section 31 Cr.P.C. says that subject to the provisions of
			<lb />
			Section 71 IPC, Court may pass separate sentences for two or more
			<lb />
			offences of which the accused is found guilty, but the aggregate
			<lb />
			punishment must not exceed the limit fixed in the proviso (a) and
			<lb />
			(b) of sub-section (2) of Section 31 Cr.P.C. In Section 31(1)
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C., since the word -may‖ is used, in our considered view,
			<lb />
			when a person is convicted for two or more offences at one trial,
			<lb />
			the court may exercise its discretion in directing that the sentence
			<lb />
			for each offence may either run consecutively or concurrently
			<lb />
			subject to the provisions of Section 71 IPC. But the aggregate
			<lb />
			must not exceed the limit fixed in proviso (a) and (b) of sub-section
			<lb />
			(2) of Section 31 Cr.P.C. that is -(i) it should not exceed 14 years
			<lb />
			and (ii) it cannot exceed twice the maximum imprisonment
			<lb />
			awardable by the sentencing court for a single offence.‖ (para 10)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) -The words -unless the court directs that such punishments
			<lb />
			shall run concurrently‖ occurring in sub-section (1) of Section 31,
			<lb />
			make it clear that Section 31 Cr.P.C. vests a discretion in the
			<lb />
			Court to direct that the punishment shall run concurrently, when
			<lb />
			the accused is convicted at one trial for two or more offences. It is
			<lb />
			manifest from Section 31 Cr.P.C. that the Court has the power and
			<lb />
			discretion to issue a direction for concurrent running of the
			<lb />
			sentences when the accused is convicted at one trial for two or
			<lb />
			more offences. Section 31 Cr.P.C. authorizes the passing of
			<lb />
			concurrent sentences in cases of substantive sentences of
			<lb />
			imprisonment. Any sentence of imprisonment in default of fine
			<lb />
			has to be in excess of, and not concurrent with, any other
			<lb />
			sentence of imprisonment to which the convict may have been
			<lb />
			sentenced.‖ (para 11)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii) -Discretion to order running of sentences concurrently or
			<lb />
			consecutively is judicial discretion of the Court which is to be
			<lb />
			exercised as per established law of sentencing. The court before
			<lb />
			exercising its discretion under Section 31 Cr.P.C. is required to
			<lb />
			consider the totality of the facts and circumstances of those
			<lb />
			offences against the accused while deciding whether sentences are
			<lb />
			to run consecutively or concurrently.‖ (para 12)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iv) -Section 31(1) Cr.P.C. enjoins a further direction by the
			<lb />
			court to specify the order in which one particular sentence shall
			<lb />
			commence after the expiration of the other.‖ (para 13)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			201. The Supreme Court separately noted the working out of the
			<lb />
			sentences if upon conviction for several offences, in a single trial,
			<lb />
			one of the punishments imposed on the convict is a life sentence.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The discussion, findings and the law laid by the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			this regard deserve to be extracted and read thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-13. ... Difficulties arise when the Courts impose
			<lb />
			sentence of imprisonment for life and also sentences of
			<lb />
			imprisonment for fixed term. In such cases, if the Court
			<lb />
			does not direct that the sentences shall run concurrently,
			<lb />
			then the sentences will run consecutively by operation
			<lb />
			of Section 31(1) Cr.P.C. There is no question of the
			<lb />
			convict first undergoing the sentence of imprisonment for
			<lb />
			life and thereafter undergoing the rest of the sentences of
			<lb />
			imprisonment for fixed term and any such direction
			<lb />
			would be unworkable. Since sentence of imprisonment
			<lb />
			for life means jail till the end of normal life of the
			<lb />
			convict, the sentence of imprisonment of fixed term has
			<lb />
			to necessarily run concurrently with life imprisonment.
			<lb />
			In such case, it will be in order if the Sessions Judges
			<lb />
			exercise their discretion in issuing direction for
			<lb />
			concurrent running of sentences. Likewise if two life
			<lb />
			sentences are imposed on the convict, necessarily, Court
			<lb />
			has to direct those sentences to run concurrently.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			14. The opening words -in the case of consecutive
			<lb />
			sentences‖ in sub-section (2) of Section 31 Cr.P.C. make
			<lb />
			it clear that this sub-section refers to a case in which
			<lb />
			-consecutive sentences‖ are ordered. The provision says
			<lb />
			that if an aggregate punishment for several offences is
			<lb />
			found to be in excess of punishment which the Court is
			<lb />
			competent to inflict on a conviction of single offence, it
			<lb />
			shall not be necessary for the Court to send the offender
			<lb />
			for trial before a higher court. Proviso (a) is added to sub-
			<lb />
			section (2) of Section 31 Cr.P.C. to limit the aggregate of
			<lb />
			sentences -that in no case, the aggregate of consecutive
			<lb />
			sentences passed against an accused shall exceed
			<lb />
			fourteen years. -Fourteen years rule‖ contained in
			<lb />
			clause (a) of the proviso to Section 31(2) Cr.P.C. may
			<lb />
			not be applicable in relation to sentence of
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life, since imprisonment for life
			<lb />
			means the convict will remain in jail till the end of his
			<lb />
			normal life.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			15. In Ramesh Chilwal v. State of Uttarakhand (2012) 11
			<lb />
			SCC 629, the accused was convicted under Section 302
			<lb />
			IPC and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life.
			<lb />
			Accused was also convicted under Sections 2/3 [3(1)] of
			<lb />
			the U.P. Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities
			<lb />
			(Prevention) Act, 1986 and sentenced to undergo
			<lb />
			rigorous imprisonment for ten years and under Section 27
			<lb />
			of the Arms Act sentenced to further undergo rigorous
			<lb />
			imprisonment for seven years. Considering the fact that
			<lb />
			the trial court had awarded life sentence under Section
			<lb />
			302 IPC, this Court directed that all sentences imposed
			<lb />
			under Section 302 IPC, Sections 2/3 [3(1)] of the
			<lb />
			Gangsters Act and Section 27 of the Arms Act to run
			<lb />
			concurrently.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
			202. Clause (a) of the proviso to Section 31(2) of the Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
			stands thus clarified by the Supreme Court in para 14 when it has
			<lb />
			declared that the restriction therein would not apply to life
			<lb />
			imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			203. We find that in para 15 of O.M. Cherian@ Thankachan, it
			<lb />
			is noted that the court in Ramesh Chilwal v. State of Uttarakhand,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 165
			<lb />
			(2012) 11 SCC 629, considered the fact that the trial court had
			<lb />
			awarded life sentence under Section 302 and as such, the sentences
			<lb />
			imposed on the convict were directed to run concurrently.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			204. In para 16 (of O.M. Cherian), the court noted that in V.K.
			<lb />
			Bansal v. State of Haryana &amp; Anr. (2013) 7 SCC 211, it was
			<lb />
			observed thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-… we may say that the legal position favours exercise
			<lb />
			of discretion to the benefit of the prisoner in cases where
			<lb />
			the prosecution is based on a single transaction no matter
			<lb />
			different complaints in relation thereto may have been
			<lb />
			filed as is the position in cases involving dishonour of
			<lb />
			cheques issued by the borrower towards repayment of a
			<lb />
			loan to the creditor.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			205. The judgment in V.K. Bansal thus offers guidance in cases
			<lb />
			as cheques bouncing. Where the prosecution is based on a single
			<lb />
			transaction, it may not matter that different complaints in relation
			<lb />
			thereto may have been filed. The judgment notes that judicial
			<lb />
			discretion would be exercised to the benefit of the prisoner in such
			<lb />
			cases where the prosecution is based on a single transaction. The
			<lb />
			court also noted that Mohd. Akhtar Hussain @ Ibrahim Ahmed
			<lb />
			Bhatti as well as (2014) 2 SCC 153, Manoj @ Panu v. State of
			<lb />
			Haryana cases did not arise out of conviction at one trial in two or
			<lb />
			more offences. It was pointed out that the reference to Section 31
			<lb />
			of the Cr.P.C. in those cases was not necessitated.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			206. It is important to note that by the judgment in O.M.
			<lb />
			Cherian@ Thankachan, the Supreme Court has not taken away
			<lb />
			the judicial discretion in awarding a concurrent or consecutive
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 166
			<lb />
			sentence in case of conviction for multiple offences. On the
			<lb />
			contrary, in para 20 of the pronouncement, the Supreme Court has
			<lb />
			noted the object, spirit and intendment of Section 31 of the Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
			in the following terms:
			<lb />
			-
		</p>
		<item>
			20. Under Section 31 Cr.P.C. it is left to the full
			<lb />
			discretion of the Court to order the sentences to run
			<lb />
			concurrently in case of conviction for two or more
			<lb />
			offences. It is difficult to lay down any straitjacket
			<lb />
			approach in the matter of exercise of such discretion by
			<lb />
			the courts. By and large, trial courts and appellate courts
			<lb />
			have invoked and exercised their discretion to issue
			<lb />
			directions for concurrent running of sentences, favouring
			<lb />
			the benefit to be given to the accused. Whether a
			<lb />
			direction for concurrent running of sentences ought to
			<lb />
			be issued in a given case would depend upon the nature
			<lb />
			of the offence or offences committed and the facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of the case. The discretion has to be
			<lb />
			exercised along the judicial lines and not mechanically.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			21. Accordingly, we answer the Reference by holding
			<lb />
			that Section 31 Cr.P.C. leaves full discretion with the
			<lb />
			Court to order sentences for two or more offences at
			<lb />
			one trial to run concurrently, having regard to the
			<lb />
			nature of offences and attendant aggravating or
			<lb />
			mitigating circumstances. We do not find any reason to
			<lb />
			hold that normal rule is to order the sentence to be
			<lb />
			consecutive and exception is to make the sentences
			<lb />
			concurrent. Of course, if the Court does not order the
			<lb />
			sentence to be concurrent, one sentence may run after
			<lb />
			the other, in such order as the Court may direct. We
			<lb />
			also do not find any conflict in earlier judgment in Mohd.
			<lb />
			Akhtar Hussain and Section 31 Cr.P.C.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
			Paras 20 and 21 of O.M. Cherian @ Thankachan thus
			<lb />
			unequivocally declare that it has been left to the full discretion of
			<lb />
			the court awarding the sentences to direct that they would run
			<lb />
			concurrently or consecutively.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			207. It is also manifest from the above that if by exercise of
			<lb />
			judicial discretion, a sentence of life imprisonment is imposed
			<lb />
			upon a convict for commission of one out of several offences, then
			<lb />
			the court would not direct the multiple sentences to run
			<lb />
			consecutively as life imprisonment actually means imprisonment
			<lb />
			for the remainder of a person&apos;s life. Inherent therein is the
			<lb />
			jurisdiction of the court that, if life imprisonment is not for the
			<lb />
			remainder of the person&apos;s life, because of intervention of the event
			<lb />
			of the exercise of the discretion under Sections 432, 433 and 433A
			<lb />
			of the Cr.P.C. resulting in remission or the commutation of the life
			<lb />
			sentence, the sentencing court can anticipate such an eventuality
			<lb />
			and direct a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment before
			<lb />
			the appellant&apos;s case for remission or commutation in exercise of
			<lb />
			the statutory power, could be considered by the authorities of the
			<lb />
			State. There is nothing in Section 31 which prohibits the court
			<lb />
			from doing so.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			208. The above conclusion is supported by some important
			<lb />
			features of Section 31 which have otherwise escaped notice. When
			<lb />
			examined closely, the drafting and the statutory scheme of Section
			<lb />
			31 reveals important aspects of the legislative intent and objective.
			<lb />
			Let us examine the proviso contained in Section 31. Does the
			<lb />
			proviso govern both sub-section 1 as well as sub-section 2 or is it
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 168
			<lb />
			restricted in its application to sub-section 2 thereof? The
			<lb />
			legislature has affixed punctuations carefully in this enactment.
			<lb />
			We find that a full stop is affixed at the end of sub-section 1
			<lb />
			manifesting the legislative intent that the sub-section was complete
			<lb />
			by itself. As against this, at the end of sub-section 2, before the
			<lb />
			incorporation of the proviso, the legislature has used a colon,
			<lb />
			thereby unequivocally declaring that the sub-section had not
			<lb />
			concluded but was governed by the proviso which follows. This
			<lb />
			intent is also manifested from the contents of the proviso as would
			<lb />
			be evident from the following discussion.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			209. Are we placing unnecessary importance on punctuation? On
			<lb />
			the question of significance of punctuation for statutory
			<lb />
			interpretation, in the pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported
			<lb />
			at AIR 1952 SC 369, Aswini Kumar Ghose &amp; Anr. v. Arabinda
			<lb />
			Bose &amp; Anr., the court observed as follows:
			<lb />
			-56. ... Punctuation is after all a minor element in the
			<lb />
			construction of a statute, and very little attention is paid
			<lb />
			to it by English courts. Cockburn, C.J. said in (1861) 1 B
			<lb />
			&amp; Sp. 101, Stephenson v. Taylor. -On the Parliament
			<lb />
			Roll there is no punctuation and we therefore are not
			<lb />
			bound by that in the printed copies.‖ It seems, however,
			<lb />
			that in the Vellum copies printed since 1850 there are
			<lb />
			some cases of punctuation, and when they occur they can
			<lb />
			be looked upon as a sort of contemporanea exposition.
			<lb />
			When a statute is carefully punctuated and there is doubt
			<lb />
			about its meaning, a weight should undoubtedly be given
			<lb />
			to the punctuation. I need not deny that punctuation may
			<lb />
			have its uses in some cases, but it cannot certainly be
			<lb />
			regarded as a controlling element and cannot be allowed
			<lb />
			to control the plain meaning of a text.‖
			<lb />
			(Underlining by us)
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 169
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			210. In the judgment reported at (2005) 2 SCC 591, Jamshed N.
			<lb />
			Gujdar v. State of Maharashtra &amp; Ors., the court noted the above
			<lb />
			enunciation of principles in Aswini Kumar Ghose &amp; Anr. as well
			<lb />
			as Full Bench judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court
			<lb />
			reported at AIR 1972 Calcutta 160, Rajinder Singh v. Kultar
			<lb />
			Singh. In this case, the court was concerned with the use of a
			<lb />
			‗semicolon&apos; and it was held that the punctuation should not be
			<lb />
			discarded as being inappropriate and that the punctuation has been
			<lb />
			put with a definite object of making the topic as distinct and not
			<lb />
			having relation only to the topic that follows thereafter. The
			<lb />
			expression -administration of justice‖ in Entry 3 List II (now Entry
			<lb />
			11A of List III) of the Constitution of India. Therefore, the use of
			<lb />
			the ‗full-stop&apos; after sub-section 1 of Section 31 and the ‗colon&apos; at
			<lb />
			the end of sub-section 2 have to be given their correct and
			<lb />
			complete import.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			211. Justice G.P. Singh in the 9 th edition of the authoritative text
			<lb />
			-Interpretation of Statutes‖, has noted at page 158 that -with
			<lb />
			respect to modern statutes, that if the statute in question is found to
			<lb />
			be carefully punctuated, punctuation, though a minor element, may
			<lb />
			be resorted to for purposes of construction‖. This text notes the
			<lb />
			judgment of the Supreme Court reported at AIR 1979 SC 564,
			<lb />
			Mohd. Shabbir v. State of Maharashtra where Section 27 of the
			<lb />
			Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 came up for construction. By this
			<lb />
			section whoever ‗manufactures for sale, sells, stocks or exhibits for
			<lb />
			sale or distributes&apos; a drug without a licence, is liable for
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 170
			<lb />
			punishment. In holding that mere stocking is not an offence within
			<lb />
			the section, the Supreme Court pointed out the presence of comma
			<lb />
			after ‗manufactures for sale&apos; and ‗sells&apos; while there is absence of
			<lb />
			any comma after ‗stocks&apos;. It was, therefore, held that only stocking
			<lb />
			for sale could amount to offence and not mere stocking.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			212. We also find the reference to the pronouncement reported at
			<lb />
			AIR 1988 SC 1841, M.K. Salpekar (Dr.) v. Sunil Kumar
			<lb />
			Shamsunder Chaudhari in this authoritative text. In this case, the
			<lb />
			court was construing Clause 13(3)(v) of the C.P. and Berar Letting
			<lb />
			of Houses and Rent Control Order. This provision permits
			<lb />
			ejectment of a tenant on the ground that -the tenant has secured
			<lb />
			alternative accommodation, or has left the area for a continuous
			<lb />
			period of four months and does not reasonably need the house‖. In
			<lb />
			holding that the requirement that the tenant ‗does not reasonably
			<lb />
			need the house&apos; has no application when he ‗has secured
			<lb />
			alternative accommodation&apos; the court referred and relied upon
			<lb />
			punctuation, the comma after the words alternative
			<lb />
			accommodation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			213. It is manifest that while punctuation alone shall not control
			<lb />
			the construction of legislation, however, assistance can certainly be
			<lb />
			taken from it in construing the prescription and intent of the
			<lb />
			legislature. The full stop at the end of sub-section (1) of Section 31
			<lb />
			of the Cr.P.C. and the colon at the end of the sub-section (2)
			<lb />
			thereof therefore, must receive their necessary importance and
			<lb />
			meaning. Punctuations in Section 31 clearly point out that the
			<lb />
			proviso governs only sub-section (2) of Section 31 and not sub-
			<lb />
			section (1).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			214. We now propose to advert to a second imperative aspect of
			<lb />
			Section 31, which is the jurisdictional limitation on the hierarchy of
			<lb />
			courts in the criminal justice system, a very important factor which
			<lb />
			in our view is at the core of the interpretation and working of
			<lb />
			Section 31 of the Cr.P.C. The power of courts in the criminal
			<lb />
			justice system is delineated in Chapter 3 of the Code of Criminal
			<lb />
			Procedure, 1973. Section 26 thereof prescribes that subject to
			<lb />
			other provisions of the Code, any offence under the IPC may be
			<lb />
			tried by the High Court or the court of session or any other court by
			<lb />
			which such offence is shown in the First Schedule to be triable.
			<lb />
			The legislature has stipulated that the offences specified in the
			<lb />
			proviso shall be tried as far as practicable by a court presided over
			<lb />
			by a woman.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			215. Under sub-section 1 of Section 28, a High Court may pass
			<lb />
			any sentence authorized by law. Under sub-section 2, a Sessions
			<lb />
			Judge or Additional Sessions Judge is also empowered to pass any
			<lb />
			sentence authorized by law; but any sentence of death passed by
			<lb />
			such judge shall be subject to confirmation by the High Court. By
			<lb />
			virtue of sub-section 3, the Additional Sessions Judge is
			<lb />
			empowered to pass any sentence authorized by law except a
			<lb />
			sentence of death or of imprisonment for life or of imprisonment
			<lb />
			for a term exceeding 10 years.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			216. So far as magistrates are concerned, the sentences which
			<lb />
			they are authorized to pass are prescribed in Section 29. Under
			<lb />
			sub-section 1 thereof, the Chief Judicial Magistrate is authorized to
			<lb />
			pass any sentence of imprisonment up to 7 years. The court of
			<lb />
			magistrate of the first class is empowered by virtue of sub-section 2
			<lb />
			to pass a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3
			<lb />
			years or of fine not exceeding Rs.10,000/-or of both. Under sub-
			<lb />
			section 3, the court of magistrate of the second class is empowered
			<lb />
			to pass a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding one
			<lb />
			year or of fine not exceeding Rs.5,000/-or of both. Section 29(4)
			<lb />
			also clarifies that the court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate shall
			<lb />
			have the same powers as the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate
			<lb />
			while that of Metropolitan Magistrate shall have those of the court
			<lb />
			of Magistrate of the first class.
			<lb />
			It is evident from the above, that as per the statutory scheme,
			<lb />
			there is limitation on the power to impose imprisonment on all
			<lb />
			magistrates.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			217. It is significant that Section 31 of the Cr.P.C. is placed in
			<lb />
			Chapter III which is captioned -Power of Courts‖. Section 31 is
			<lb />
			placed just after the aforenoticed statutory provisions setting out
			<lb />
			the limits on sentencing powers of the courts. It is extremely
			<lb />
			pertinent that sub-section 1 of Section 31 of the Cr.P.C. makes no
			<lb />
			reference to a maximum sentence which the court in question may
			<lb />
			award. On the other hand, sub-section 2 makes a clear reference to
			<lb />
			competency of the court to impose a sentence. It further refers to
			<lb />
			the aggregate punishment for the several offences being in -excess
			<lb />
			of the punishment which the trial court had the competency to
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 173
			<lb />
			inflict‖. Competency has to relate to a limit on the power to
			<lb />
			impose punishment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			218. The sub-section (2) also refers to -trial before higher
			<lb />
			court‖. Such limit on competency is obviously relatable only to
			<lb />
			offences which are punishable with term imprisonments not
			<lb />
			extending to life as life means the rest of the convicts&apos; life or death
			<lb />
			penalty. There is therefore, no -limit‖ on punishment if the court is
			<lb />
			competent to hand out the life sentence. The concept of -excess
			<lb />
			….of competency…‖ would therefore, not apply to trials and
			<lb />
			convictions for offences punishable with life sentences and
			<lb />
			consequently to trials by Sessions Courts. For this reason as well,
			<lb />
			sub-section (2) of Section 31 refers to trials by the Magistrates
			<lb />
			while sub-section 1 of Section 31 clearly refers to Sessions trials.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			219. Even para 27 of Duryodhan Rout notes that the proviso in
			<lb />
			Section 31 is relatable to sub-section (2) of Section 31. We find
			<lb />
			that if the absolute prohibition urged by Mr. Verma was accepted,
			<lb />
			sub-section (1) of Section 31 would be rendered otiose which
			<lb />
			cannot be the legislative intent.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			220. There is yet another reason for so construing these sub-
			<lb />
			sections of Section 31. Under the Cr.P.C., trials are conducted
			<lb />
			either before the Magistrate or the Sessions Judge. Some trials
			<lb />
			may be placed before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate. Sub-
			<lb />
			section 2 refers to a &quot;trial before a higher court&quot; (which given the
			<lb />
			scheme of the Cr.P.C., could be the court of the Chief Metropolitan
			<lb />
			Magistrate or Sessions court). Sub-section 1 of Section 31 on the
			<lb />
			other hand makes no such reference to any higher court. In the
			<lb />
			hierarchy of courts (below the high court) conducting criminal
			<lb />
			trials, the Sessions Court stands at the highest. It is therefore,
			<lb />
			apparent that sub-section (2) of Section 31 is confined in its
			<lb />
			application to courts other than Sessions courts.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			221. We now propose to examine yet another reason to support
			<lb />
			the view which we have taken. It is settled law that life
			<lb />
			imprisonment means imprisonment for the remainder of the
			<lb />
			person&apos;s life unless remitted under the Section 433 etc. of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. Proviso (a) in Section 31 restricts the sentence of
			<lb />
			imprisonment for a period up to fourteen years. If it were held that
			<lb />
			proviso (a) applies to cases of life imprisonment it would follow
			<lb />
			that even for committing multiple offences punishable with death
			<lb />
			(where life was awarded) or life sentences, the convict could
			<lb />
			undergo a maximum of 14 years imprisonment only. Any such
			<lb />
			restriction is contrary to the several provisions of the Indian Penal
			<lb />
			Code, the Cr.P.C. as well as binding judicial pronouncements
			<lb />
			which we have noticed above. Therefore, proviso (a) is not
			<lb />
			concerned with life imprisonments.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			222. So far as proviso (b) is concerned, it refers to &quot;amount of
			<lb />
			punishment which the court is competent to inflict for a single
			<lb />
			offence&quot;. The proviso (b) restricts the maximum imprisonment to
			<lb />
			twice the amount of such punishment. This obviously also does
			<lb />
			not refer to the life imprisonment which means remainder of the
			<lb />
			person&apos;s life. If life means remainder of the person&apos;s life, there can
			<lb />
			certainly be no &quot;twice&quot; of such life imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			223. The proposition pressed by Mr. Sumeet Verma results in the
			<lb />
			completely unacceptable position for one more reason. While
			<lb />
			trying a single offence attracting the punishment up to 20 years
			<lb />
			imprisonment, (say the offence under Section 376A of the IPC
			<lb />
			which prescribe a minimum sentence of 20 years), the Sessions
			<lb />
			Court would have the power to incarcerate the convict for 20 years
			<lb />
			imprisonment. However, if the Sessions Court was concerned with
			<lb />
			the case involving the multiple offences of rape under Section 376
			<lb />
			as well as the offence of murder for which life imprisonment was
			<lb />
			considered appropriate, the Sessions Court would be empowered to
			<lb />
			impose a maximum sentence of 14 years. This could never have
			<lb />
			been the legislative intent.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			224. The absurd result on accepting the proposition pressed on
			<lb />
			behalf of the convicts is also illustrated in a case involving a
			<lb />
			conviction for offence under Section 376 which prescribes a
			<lb />
			minimum sentence of 10 years which may extend to imprisonment
			<lb />
			for life meaning imprisonment for the remainder of the person&apos;s
			<lb />
			life and the conviction for the offence under Section 326 of the
			<lb />
			IPC. To accept the proposition that the proviso under Section
			<lb />
			31(2) applies to the sessions trial, the Sessions Court would be
			<lb />
			empowered to award a maximum of 14 years imprisonment. This
			<lb />
			is in clear contradiction to the statutory prescription.
			<lb />
			For all these reasons as well, the proviso in Section 31 does
			<lb />
			not govern sub-section 1 of Section 31 whereunder life
			<lb />
			imprisonment is imposed. The proviso is restricted to sub-section
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 176
			<lb />
			2 of Section 31 which refers to other imprisonments referable to
			<lb />
			limits.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			225. Mr. Sumeet Verma has placed reliance on Section 427 of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. which for the sake of convenience also deserves to be
			<lb />
			extracted and reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;427. Sentence on offender already sentenced for
			<lb />
			another offence.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(1) When a person already undergoing a sentence of
			<lb />
			imprisonment is sentenced on a subsequent conviction
			<lb />
			to imprisonment or imprisonment for life, such
			<lb />
			imprisonment or imprisonment for life shall commence
			<lb />
			at the expiration of the imprisonment to which he has
			<lb />
			been previously sentenced, unless the Court directs that
			<lb />
			the subsequent sentence shall run concurrently with
			<lb />
			such previous sentence: Provided that where a person
			<lb />
			who has been sentenced to imprisonment by an order
			<lb />
			under section 122 in default of furnishing security is,
			<lb />
			whilst undergoing such sentence, sentenced to
			<lb />
			imprisonment for an offence committed prior to the
			<lb />
			making of such order, the latter sentence shall
			<lb />
			commence immediately.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2) When a person already undergoing a sentence of
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life is sentenced on a subsequent
			<lb />
			conviction to imprisonment for a term or imprisonment
			<lb />
			for life, the subsequent sentence shall run con-currently
			<lb />
			with such previous sentence.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			226. Section 31 of the Cr.P.C. is concerned with multiple
			<lb />
			offences committed by a person with which he is charged in the
			<lb />
			same trial. The legislature has anticipated the aspect of recidivism
			<lb />
			by a convict who commits a second offence while undergoing the
			<lb />
			sentence in a prior conviction. Such situation has been considered
			<lb />
			in Section 427 of the Cr.P.C. In fact, judicial discretion for
			<lb />
			awarding consecutive sentence for a repeat offender while
			<lb />
			undergoing a sentence in a prior conviction has been taken away.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			227. Sub-section 1 of Section 31 of the Cr.P.C. which stipulates
			<lb />
			that punishments for imprisonment for the second sentence shall
			<lb />
			commence at the expiry of the imprisonment under the previous
			<lb />
			sentence -unless the court directs that such punishments shall run
			<lb />
			concurrently‖.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			228. Bachan Singh has suggested the option of imposing death
			<lb />
			punishment as a penalty of last resort when any other alternative
			<lb />
			punishment would be futile. The options of awarding either fixed
			<lb />
			term prison sentences or directing that the sentences would run
			<lb />
			consecutively, in fact, tantamounts to following the dictum in
			<lb />
			Bachan Singh opting for the alternative punishment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			229. By virtue of Section 31, the sentences shall run concurrently
			<lb />
			only if the court so directs. If not so directed, the sentences would
			<lb />
			run consecutively.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			230. The pronouncements in (2006) 12 SCC 37 : 2006 (12)
			<lb />
			SCALE 381, Chatar Singh v. State of M.P., 2014 SCC OnLine
			<lb />
			SC 512 : 2014 (8) SCALE 96, Duryodhan Rout v. State of Orissa
			<lb />
			and (2014) 2 SCC 153 (D.O.D. 9 th December, 2013) Manoj @
			<lb />
			Panu v. State of Haryana did not consider the various issues and
			<lb />
			aspects considered by the larger Bench of the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			O.M. Cherian @ Thankachan v. State of Kerala &amp; Ors. The
			<lb />
			various aspects noted by us above were also not placed before the
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 178
			<lb />
			courts. It is the larger Bench decision which thus has to guide
			<lb />
			adjudication in the present case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			231. It is therefore, trite that while awarding a sentence of
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life, the court can direct a fixed term of
			<lb />
			imprisonment exceeding 14 or 20 years with or without remissions
			<lb />
			instead of a death sentence. In a trial where the defendant has been
			<lb />
			tried for multiple offence, the sentencing court has another option
			<lb />
			to direct sentences for different offences to run consecutively.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			232. The jurisprudence extracted above, most importantly also
			<lb />
			illustrates that, if a person stands convicted for several offences,
			<lb />
			each of which is punishable with death or life imprisonment, if the
			<lb />
			life sentence means the remainder of the convicts&apos; life, two life
			<lb />
			sentences could also be directed to run concurrently.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			233. If the executive is considering remittance of the remainder of
			<lb />
			a life sentence imposed on a convict at any stage, in order to ensure
			<lb />
			a minimum imprisonment, the sentencing court is also amply
			<lb />
			empowered to direct that the punishment for other convictions
			<lb />
			including two life sentences, shall run consecutively. (Ref. :
			<lb />
			(2013) 3 SCC 52 : (2013) 2 SCALE 505, Sanaullah Khan v. State
			<lb />
			of Bihar wherein two life sentences stood imposed.) The court is
			<lb />
			thereby able to ensure adequacy of the punishment for grievous
			<lb />
			offences.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			234. To conclude, therefore, so far as sentencing for offences
			<lb />
			punishable with death or life imprisonment is concerned, four
			<lb />
			options of punishments are recognised: the first, death penalty; the
			<lb />
			second, life imprisonment subject to Sections 432 to 433A of
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C.; the third, life meaning, either the whole of the remainder
			<lb />
			of life, or, a mandatory fixed term of imprisonment before which
			<lb />
			an application for remission and a fourth; upon conviction for
			<lb />
			multiple offences, the sentences awarded shall run consecutively,
			<lb />
			not concurrently.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			VII. Honour killing -whether penalty of only the death
			<lb />
			sentence
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			235. We now turn to the submissions premised on the motive for
			<lb />
			the crime as an indicator for imposition of the death penalty. This
			<lb />
			time an absolute proposition is urged by Mr. Rajesh Mahajan,
			<lb />
			learned Additional Standing Counsel for the State and Mr. P.K.
			<lb />
			Dey, learned counsel appearing for the complainant -Nilam
			<lb />
			Katara. Their contention is that the murder of Nitish Katara falls in
			<lb />
			the class of offences categorized as -honour killing‖. Such a
			<lb />
			killing does not stop at being a criminal offence but is a sufficient
			<lb />
			evil sans rationale or logic. It is submitted that the killing of Nitish
			<lb />
			Katara rested in the sense which obtained with the defendants that
			<lb />
			he had to be killed to save the -honour of their family‖. Our
			<lb />
			attention is drawn to paras 2012 to 2026 (pages 1106 to 1116) of
			<lb />
			our judgment dated 2 nd April, 2014 as well as para 32 of the trial
			<lb />
			court judgment wherein it has been held that Nitish&apos;s killing fell in
			<lb />
			the honour killing category.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			236. Mr. Dey would urge that this offence falls in the category of
			<lb />
			the extreme social evils which include bride burning; dowry death;
			<lb />
			untouchability; sati; human sacrifices. It epitomises prejudices and
			<lb />
			social structures which have to be broken. Learned counsel has
			<lb />
			reminded us of our finding that the murder of Nitish Katara in fact
			<lb />
			violated Bharti Yadav&apos;s absolute right to choose her life partner, an
			<lb />
			integral part of her right to life apart from also violating the right to
			<lb />
			life of the deceased.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			237. Mr. Dey urges that the killing for honour in the instant case
			<lb />
			ipso facto thus falls into the category of rarest of rare cases and that
			<lb />
			the convicts have displayed extreme depravity which is not only
			<lb />
			extremely revolting for the immediate family but has shocked the
			<lb />
			collective conscience of the society. Given the caste structure
			<lb />
			which the convicts were trying to protect, it is urged that their acts
			<lb />
			in abducting; throttling; brutally murdering Nitish Katara and
			<lb />
			thereafter burning his dead body beyond identification in the name
			<lb />
			of honour was a gruesome, merciless and brutal act for which death
			<lb />
			penalty was inevitable. In support of this submission, learned
			<lb />
			counsel has placed reliance on the pronouncements reported at
			<lb />
			(2007) 12 SCC 654, Mayakaur Baldevsingh Sardar &amp; Anr. v.
			<lb />
			State of Maharashtra; (2011) 6 SCC 396, Bhagwan Dass v. State
			<lb />
			(NCT of Delhi); (2011) 6 SCC 405, Arumugam Servai v. State of
			<lb />
			Tamil Nadu; (2011) 14 SCC 401, Ajitsingh Harnamsingh Gujral
			<lb />
			v. State of Maharashtra.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			238. On the other hand, Mr. Sumeet Verma, learned counsel
			<lb />
			arguing for the defendant-Vikas Yadav has contended that none of
			<lb />
			these judgments support the submissions propounded by learned
			<lb />
			counsel for the complainant. It is contended that either the case
			<lb />
			does not relate to honour killing, or, where the case relates to
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 181
			<lb />
			honour killing, the court has not awarded or approved of an award
			<lb />
			of death sentence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			239. We propose to consider these cases in the seriatum as
			<lb />
			submitted by learned counsel before us. In (2007) 12 SCC 654,
			<lb />
			Mayakaur Baldevsingh Sardar &amp; Anr. v. State of Maharashtra,
			<lb />
			enraged by the victim girl&apos;s secret marriage with a boy belonging
			<lb />
			to a lower caste despite resistance and threats by her parents,
			<lb />
			members of her parental family came to her in-laws house in a pre-
			<lb />
			planned manner where she was living. On 30 th May, 1999, after
			<lb />
			recovering the jewellery which she had taken with her, they made a
			<lb />
			murderous attack on her and killed other members of the house
			<lb />
			including her husband. In this attack, Rajvinder Kaur, though
			<lb />
			grievously hurt but survived in the incident, went crawling to the
			<lb />
			house of a neighbour, and informed him of the assault on her
			<lb />
			family on which he called the police. By the judgment dated 21 st
			<lb />
			December, 2001, the Additional Sessions Judge awarded death
			<lb />
			sentence to four of the accused. The Division Bench of the High
			<lb />
			Court of Judicature at Bombay gave divergent judgments on 26 th
			<lb />
			February, 2003 when the case was heard for confirmation of the
			<lb />
			death sentence. The judgment of the third judge was delivered on
			<lb />
			25 th April, 2003 reaffirming the sentences which directed the
			<lb />
			convicts to undergo imprisonment for life under Sections 302/34
			<lb />
			IPC. In these circumstances, all the convicts who were undergoing
			<lb />
			life sentences imposed by the High Court, challenged their
			<lb />
			conviction and sentences. The State also filed an appeal praying
			<lb />
			for award of death sentence before the Supreme Court. The
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 182
			<lb />
			observations of the court on the imposition of death penalty, its
			<lb />
			efficacy especially in the context of the honour killing involved,
			<lb />
			deserve to be extracted and read as follows :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-25. We have something to say on this aspect. The
			<lb />
			efficacy or otherwise of the death penalty is a matter of
			<lb />
			much debate in legal circles-with two diametrically
			<lb />
			opposite views on the subject. However, as the Penal
			<lb />
			Code visualises the imposition of this penalty, the
			<lb />
			circumstances under which it should be imposed are
			<lb />
			also a matter of discussion, the broad principle being its
			<lb />
			award in the rarest of rare cases. Undoubtedly also
			<lb />
			while categorising a case the facts would predominate
			<lb />
			but the predilection of a judge, is a human factor (and a
			<lb />
			factor whose importance cannot be minimised) but as
			<lb />
			judges applying the law we must also be alive to the
			<lb />
			needs of society and the damage which can result if a
			<lb />
			ghastly crime is not dealt with in an effective and proper
			<lb />
			manner.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			26. We also notice that while judges tend to be
			<lb />
			extremely harsh in dealing with murders committed on
			<lb />
			account of religious factors they tend to become more
			<lb />
			conservative and almost apologetic in the case of
			<lb />
			murders arising out of caste on the premise (as in this
			<lb />
			very case) that society should be given time so that the
			<lb />
			necessary change comes about in the normal course.
			<lb />
			Has this hands-off approach led to the creation of the
			<lb />
			casteless utopia or even a perceptible movement in that
			<lb />
			direction? The answer is an emphatic ‗No&apos; as would be
			<lb />
			clear from mushrooming caste-based organisations
			<lb />
			controlled and manipulated by self-appointed
			<lb />
			commissars who have arrogated to themselves the right
			<lb />
			to be the sole arbiters and defenders of their castes with
			<lb />
			the licence to kill and maim to enforce their diktats and
			<lb />
			bring in line those who dare to deviate. Resultantly the
			<lb />
			idyllic situation that we perceive is as distant as ever. In
			<lb />
			this background is it appropriate that we throw up our
			<lb />
			hands in despair waiting ad infinitum or optimistically a
			<lb />
			millennium or two for the day when good sense would
			<lb />
			prevail by a normal evolutionary process or is it our
			<lb />
			duty to help out by a push and a prod through the
			<lb />
			criminal justice system? We feel that there can be only
			<lb />
			one answer to this question.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			240. So far as the nature of the crime was concerned and as to
			<lb />
			whether it fell under the category of awarding death sentence, in
			<lb />
			para 30 of the judgment, the court held as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-30. We are of the opinion that strictly speaking the
			<lb />
			present case would fall within the parameters
			<lb />
			visualised in Bachan Singh [(1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980
			<lb />
			SCC (Cri) 580] and Machhi Singh [(1983) 3 SCC 470 :
			<lb />
			1983 SCC (Cri) 681] cases. The diabolical nature of the
			<lb />
			crime and the murder of helpless individuals committed
			<lb />
			with traditional weapons with extreme cruelty and
			<lb />
			premeditation is exacerbated by the fact that Maya Kaur
			<lb />
			and Nirmal Kaur had come upstairs and recovered the
			<lb />
			jewellery and clothes from Rajvinder Kaur just before
			<lb />
			the actual murders.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The Supreme Court, therefore, examined beyond the caste
			<lb />
			basis for the crime and then concluded that the crime fell in the
			<lb />
			&apos;rarest of rare&apos; category. The premeditation, the manner in which it
			<lb />
			was committed, the nature of weapons used, the helpless state of
			<lb />
			the victims, the extreme cruelty perpetrated were some of the
			<lb />
			circumstances which persuaded the court to so conclude.
			<lb />
			Despite these observations, in para 31, the court noted the
			<lb />
			time which had gone since the death sentence had been awarded to
			<lb />
			four of the convicts by the trial court which weighed with it. The
			<lb />
			court therefore, held that ‗in the peculiar circumstances that we
			<lb />
			now face&apos;, the Supreme Court was ‗not inclined to reverse the life
			<lb />
			sentences awarded by the High Court and to reimpose the death
			<lb />
			penalty on the accused&apos;.
			<lb />
			An evaluation of each case thus has to be conducted on the
			<lb />
			facts and circumstances of each case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			241. On the issue of honour killings in inter-caste marriages, in
			<lb />
			paras 17 and 18, of (2006) 5 SCC 475, Lata Singh v. State of U.P.
			<lb />
			&amp; Anr., the court had observed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-16. Since several such instances are coming to our
			<lb />
			knowledge of harassment, threats and violence against
			<lb />
			young men and women who marry outside their caste,
			<lb />
			we feel it necessary to make some general comments on
			<lb />
			the matter. The nation is passing through a crucial
			<lb />
			transitional period in our history, and this Court cannot
			<lb />
			remain silent in matters of great public concern, such as
			<lb />
			the present one.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			17. The caste system is a curse on the nation and the
			<lb />
			sooner it is destroyed the better. In fact, it is dividing
			<lb />
			the nation at a time when we have to be united to face
			<lb />
			the challenges before the nation unitedly. Hence, inter-
			<lb />
			caste marriages are in fact in the national interest as
			<lb />
			they will result in destroying the caste system.
			<lb />
			However, disturbing news are coming from several
			<lb />
			parts of the country that young men and women who
			<lb />
			undergo inter-caste marriage, are threatened with
			<lb />
			violence, or violence is actually committed on them. In
			<lb />
			our opinion, such acts of violence or threats or
			<lb />
			harassment are wholly illegal and those who commit
			<lb />
			them must be severely punished. This is a free and
			<lb />
			democratic country, and once a person becomes a major
			<lb />
			he or she can marry whosoever he/she likes. If the
			<lb />
			parents of the boy or girl do not approve of such inter-
			<lb />
			caste or inter-religious marriage the maximum they can
			<lb />
			do is that they can cut-off social relations with the son
			<lb />
			or the daughter, but they cannot give threats or commit
			<lb />
			or instigate acts of violence and cannot harass the
			<lb />
			person who undergoes such inter-caste or inter-religious
			<lb />
			marriage.
			<lb />
			We,
			<lb />
			therefore,
			<lb />
			direct
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			administration/police authorities throughout the country
			<lb />
			will see to it that if any boy or girl who is a major
			<lb />
			undergoes inter-caste or inter-religious marriage with a
			<lb />
			woman or man who is a major, the couple is not
			<lb />
			harassed by anyone nor subjected to threats or acts of
			<lb />
			violence, and anyone who gives such threats or harasses
			<lb />
			or commits acts of violence either himself or at his
			<lb />
			instigation, is taken to task by instituting criminal
			<lb />
			proceedings by the police against such persons and
			<lb />
			further stern action is taken against such persons as
			<lb />
			provided by law.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			18. We sometimes hear of -honour‖ killings of such
			<lb />
			persons who undergo inter-caste or inter-religious
			<lb />
			marriage of their own free will. There is nothing
			<lb />
			honourable in such killings, and in fact they are nothing
			<lb />
			but barbaric and shameful acts of murder committed
			<lb />
			by brutal, feudal-minded persons who deserve harsh
			<lb />
			punishment. Only in this way can we stamp out such
			<lb />
			acts of barbarism.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			242. We may now examine the pronouncement of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in (2011) 6 SCC 405, Arumugam Servai v. State of Tamil
			<lb />
			Nadu. This case arose in the context of an offence under the
			<lb />
			Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities)
			<lb />
			Act, 1989. In para 12, the following observations were made in
			<lb />
			this judgment:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-12. We have in recent years heard of -Khap
			<lb />
			Panchayats‖ (known as -Katta Panchayats‖ in Tamil
			<lb />
			Nadu) which often decree or encourage honour killings
			<lb />
			or other atrocities in an institutionalised way on boys
			<lb />
			and girls of different castes and religion, who wish to
			<lb />
			get married or have been married, or interfere with the
			<lb />

			<lb />
			observations in (2006) 5 SCC 475, Lata Singh v. State of U.P. &amp;
			<lb />
			Anr. in the following terms:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-12. … As already stated in Lata Singh case [(2006) 5
			<lb />
			SCC 475 : (2006) 2 SCC (Cri) 478] , there is nothing
			<lb />
			honourable in honour killing or other atrocities and, in
			<lb />
			fact, it is nothing but barbaric and shameful murder.
			<lb />
			Other atrocities in respect of personal lives of people
			<lb />
			committed by brutal, feudal-minded persons deserve
			<lb />
			harsh punishment. Only in this way can we stamp out
			<lb />
			such acts of barbarism and feudal mentality. Moreover,
			<lb />
			these acts take the law into their own hands, and amount
			<lb />
			to kangaroo courts, which are wholly illegal.‖

			244. We now come to the fourth pronouncement relied upon by
			<lb />
			Mr. P.K. Dey reported at (2011) 14 SCC 401, Ajitsingh
			<lb />
			Harnamsingh Gujral v. State of Maharashtra. In this case, the
			<lb />
			appellant burnt his wife and three grown up children in his flat by
			<lb />
			splashing petrol on them. A quarrel between the appellant and his
			<lb />
			wife was heard by some persons sleeping outside prior to the fire in
			<lb />
			the house between 4:00 A.M. to 4:30 A.M. The appellant and his
			<lb />
			car were found missing. A plastic can containing the residual
			<lb />
			petrol was recovered. The appellant was arrested four days after
			<lb />
			the incident in another city and a large amount of cash (more than
			<lb />
			Rs.7,00,000/-) and other belongings were found on him at the time
			<lb />
			of his arrest. It was these facts which indicated that the appellant
			<lb />
			had made necessary preparation to flee. The bucket with which
			<lb />
			petrol was splashed upon the victims was also recovered at
			<lb />
			appellant&apos;s instance and his alibi was found incredible. The court
			<lb />
			considered the entire jurisprudence on award of death sentences.
			<lb />
			In para 91, the court observed that &quot;a person like the appellant who
			<lb />
			instead of doing his duty of protecting his family kills them in such
			<lb />
			a cruel and barbaric manner cannot be reformed or rehabilitated.
			<lb />
			The balance sheet is heavily against him and accordingly we
			<lb />
			uphold the death sentence awarded to him&quot;.
			<lb />
			In para 93, the court reiterated the enunciation of principles
			<lb />
			in its prior judicial precedent as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-93. In our opinion a distinction has to be drawn
			<lb />
			between ordinary murders and murders which are
			<lb />
			gruesome, ghastly or horrendous. While life sentence
			<lb />
			should be given in the former, the latter belongs to the
			<lb />
			category of the rarest of rare cases, and hence death
			<lb />
			sentence should be given. This distinction has been
			<lb />
			clarified by a recent judgment of my learned brother
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble C.K. Prasad, J. in Mohd. Mannan v.State of
			<lb />
			Bihar [(2011) 5 SCC 317 : (2011) 2 SCC (Cri) 626] ,
			<lb />
			wherein it has been observed: (SCC pp. 322-23, paras
			<lb />
			23-24)
			<lb />
			-23. It is trite that death sentence can be inflicted
			<lb />
			only in a case which comes within the category of
			<lb />
			the rarest of rare cases but there is no hard-and-
			<lb />
			fast rule and parameter to decide this vexed issue.
			<lb />
			This Court had the occasion to consider the cases
			<lb />
			which can be termed as the rarest of rare cases
			<lb />
			and although certain comprehensive guidelines
			<lb />
			have been laid to adjudge this issue but no hard-
			<lb />
			and-fast formula of universal application has been
			<lb />
			laid down in this regard. Crimes are committed in
			<lb />
			so different and distinct circumstances that it is
			<lb />
			impossible to lay down comprehensive
			<lb />
			guidelines to decide this issue. Nevertheless it is
			<lb />
			widely accepted that in deciding this question the
			<lb />
			number of persons killed is not decisive.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			24. Further, the crime being brutal and heinous
			<lb />
			itself does not turn the scale towards the death
			<lb />
			sentence. When the crime is committed in an
			<lb />
			extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting
			<lb />
			or dastardly manner so as to arouse intense and
			<lb />
			extreme indignation of the community and when
			<lb />
			collective conscience of the community is
			<lb />
			petrified, one has to lean towards the death
			<lb />
			sentence. But this is not the end. If these factors
			<lb />
			are present the court has to see as to whether the
			<lb />
			accused is a menace to the society and would
			<lb />
			continue to be so, threatening its peaceful and
			<lb />
			harmonious coexistence. The court has to
			<lb />
			further enquire and believe that the accused
			<lb />
			condemned cannot be reformed or rehabilitated
			<lb />
			and shall continue with the criminal acts. In this
			<lb />
			way a balance sheet is to be prepared while
			<lb />
			considering the imposition of penalty of death of
			<lb />
			aggravating and mitigating circumstances and a
			<lb />
			just balance is to be struck. So long the death
			<lb />
			sentence is provided in the statute and when
			<lb />
			collective conscience of the community is
			<lb />
			petrified, it is expected that the holders of
			<lb />
			judicial power do not stammer dehors their
			<lb />
			personal opinion and inflict death penalty.
			<lb />
			These are the broad guidelines which this Court
			<lb />
			had laid down for imposition of the death
			<lb />
			penalty.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			245. The reiteration of the above as well as the observations of
			<lb />
			the court on the meaning of ‗rarest of rare&apos; cases in paras 94 and 97
			<lb />
			of Ajitsingh Harnamsingh Gujral also deserve to be considered
			<lb />
			extenso and read thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-94. We fully agree with the above view as it has
			<lb />
			clarified the meaning of the expression the -rarest of
			<lb />
			rare cases‖. To take a hypothetical case, supposing A
			<lb />
			murders B over a land dispute, this may be a case of
			<lb />
			ordinary murder deserving life sentence. However, if in
			<lb />
			addition to murdering B, A goes to the house of B and
			<lb />
			wipes out his entire family, then this will come in the
			<lb />
			category of the -rarest of rare cases‖ deserving death
			<lb />
			sentence. The expression the -rarest of rare cases‖
			<lb />
			cannot, of course, be defined with complete exactitude.
			<lb />
			However, the broad guidelines in this connection have
			<lb />
			been explained by various decisions of this Court. ...

			<lb />
			would also ordinarily come within this category.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			246. We agree with Mr. Sumeet Verma&apos;s submission that
			<lb />
			Ajitsingh Harnamsingh Gujral does not relate to honour killing.
			<lb />
			However, the Supreme Court has pointed out the factors which
			<lb />
			ought to weigh with the court while awarding a death sentence.
			<lb />
			The Supreme Court has reiterated the recommendation in
			<lb />
			precedents that amongst others, honour killings, where the motive
			<lb />
			for killing tantamounts to reinforcing caste structures in society,
			<lb />
			falls in the category of -rarest of rare cases‖ which deserves the
			<lb />
			ultimate sentence i.e. of death penalty.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			247. Mr. Sumeet Verma has vehemently urged that the judgment
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court in (2011) 6 SCC 396, Bhagwan Dass v.
			<lb />
			State (NCT of Delhi) does not relate to imposition of a death
			<lb />
			sentence. According to learned counsel, this judgment is per
			<lb />
			incuriam for the reason that it ignores the Constitutional Bench
			<lb />
			pronouncement in Bachan Singh. Learned counsel would also
			<lb />
			submit that this pronouncement ought not to be considered by this
			<lb />
			court for the reason that it is a solitary case which has not been
			<lb />
			relied upon in any subsequent pronouncements of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court except the above reference in Ajitsingh Harnamsingh
			<lb />
			Gujral.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			248. In Bhagwan Dass, the case of the prosecution was that the
			<lb />
			appellant was very annoyed with his daughter, who had left her
			<lb />
			husband Raju and was living in an incestuous relationship with her
			<lb />
			uncle, Sriniwas. This had infuriated the appellant as he believed
			<lb />
			that his daughter Seema&apos;s conduct had dishonoured his family.
			<lb />
			The appellant therefore, strangulated her with an electric wire. The
			<lb />
			court reiterated the observations in para 8 of Arumugam Servai as
			<lb />
			well as those in para 9 of Lata Singh. We set out hereunder the
			<lb />
			observations of the court in para 28 of the pronouncement which
			<lb />
			pg. 191
			<lb />
			we propose to deal with in some detail at a later stage in this
			<lb />
			pronouncement:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-28. Before parting with this case we would like to state
			<lb />
			that -honour‖ killings have become commonplace in
			<lb />
			many parts of the country, particularly in Haryana,
			<lb />
			western Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Often young
			<lb />
			couples who fall in love have to seek shelter in the
			<lb />
			police lines or protection homes, to avoid the wrath of
			<lb />
			kangaroo courts. We have held in Lata Singh
			<lb />
			case [(2006) 5 SCC 475 : (2006) 2 SCC (Cri) 478] that
			<lb />
			there is nothing -honourable‖ in -honour‖ killings, and
			<lb />
			they are nothing but barbaric and brutal murders by
			<lb />
			bigoted persons with feudal minds. In our opinion
			<lb />
			honour killings, for whatever reason, come within the
			<lb />
			category of the rarest of rare cases deserving death
			<lb />
			punishment. It is time to stamp out these barbaric,
			<lb />
			feudal practices which are a slur on our nation. This is
			<lb />
			necessary as a deterrent for such outrageous,
			<lb />
			uncivilised behaviour. All persons who are planning to
			<lb />
			perpetrate -honour‖ killings should know that the
			<lb />
			gallows await them.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The Supreme Court thus upheld the conviction of the
			<lb />
			appellant as well as the death sentence imposed on him. We find
			<lb />
			that the Supreme Court in fact directed that the copy of the
			<lb />
			judgment be sent to the Registrar General/Registrars of all High
			<lb />
			Courts for circulation to all judges as well as copies of the same to
			<lb />
			all Sessions Judges/Additional Sessions Judges in States as well as
			<lb />
			the Union Territories apart from Chief Secretaries, Home
			<lb />
			Secretaries and police authorities.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			249. Learned counsel for Vikas Yadav has placed reliance on a
			<lb />
			decision of the Division Bench of this court dated 17 th April, 2014
			<lb />
			in Death Sentence Ref.No.5/2012 State v. Om Prakash &amp; Ors.
			<lb />
			and connected appeals. We find the court considered all relevant
			<lb />
			factors and did not impose death sentence. In this judgment, the
			<lb />
			question under consideration was not raised for adjudication.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			250. Mr. Sumeet Verma has also placed before us the decision of
			<lb />
			the Division Bench dated 1 st October, 2014 in Crl.A.No.1165/2012,
			<lb />
			Onkar @ Mody v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi, a case involving a
			<lb />
			murder of Meenu, daughter of the appellant who was having a love
			<lb />
			affair with Sandeep, a person who belonged to the same village and
			<lb />
			same community. This relationship was not approved of by her
			<lb />
			parents resulting in her murder. The trial court had imposed the
			<lb />
			sentence for life imprisonment for the offence punishable under
			<lb />
			Section 302 of the IPC which was upheld by the court. No
			<lb />
			principle of law is either discussed or laid down in this case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			251. We must also deal with Mr. Sumeet Verma&apos;s arguments that
			<lb />
			in para 52 of Sangeet, the court said that there must be no
			<lb />
			standardization/categorization of crimes. It is argued that to hold
			<lb />
			that a death sentence must be imposed in every case involving an
			<lb />
			honour killing is therefore, impermissible.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			252. So far as the murder which is referred to as an honour killing
			<lb />
			is concerned, it refers to the motive for the offence. The offence
			<lb />
			emanates from a perverted bias of the offender/convict against
			<lb />
			persons of a particular caste, community or economic strata
			<lb />
			resulting in a heinous crime. The bias obviously is in favour of the
			<lb />
			particular caste or group to which the convict belongs.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			253. We may note that standardization or categorization of crimes
			<lb />
			for which death sentence must be mandatorily imposed is
			<lb />
			unconstitutional and legally impermissible for the reason that it
			<lb />
			absolutely excludes the judicial discretion in sentencing for such
			<lb />
			crimes. Statutory provisions mandating the death sentence have
			<lb />
			been struck down as unconstitutional being violative of Articles 14
			<lb />
			and 21 of the Constitution by the Constitution Bench
			<lb />
			pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (1983) 2 SCC
			<lb />
			277, Mithu v. State of Punjab and the recent decision reported at
			<lb />
			(2012) 3 SCC 346, State of Punjab v. Dalbir Singh. There can be
			<lb />
			no dispute that the proposition that no standardization or
			<lb />
			categorization of offences inviting death penalty mandatorily is
			<lb />
			constitutionally permissible.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			254. We have noted above that a misplaced sense of &apos;honour&apos; in a
			<lb />
			caste structure is the motive in the crime labelled as an &apos;honour
			<lb />
			killing&apos;. Therefore, the question which arises is as to what is the
			<lb />
			relevance of this motive for commission of murder so far as
			<lb />
			sentencing is concerned?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			255. In Machhi Singh, reprisal was motive for commission of the
			<lb />
			crime. A feud between two families resulted in murders in which
			<lb />
			17 lives (including men, women and children related to one Amar
			<lb />
			Singh and Piaro Bai) were tragically lost in a course of series of
			<lb />
			five incidents occurred in quick succession in five different villages
			<lb />
			in the vicinity of each other, in Punjab, on the night intervening
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg
		</p>
		<item>
			. 194
			<lb />
			12 th /13 th August, 1977. The murderers, Machhi Singh and his
			<lb />
			eleven companions, close
			<lb />
			relatives and
			<lb />
			associates were
			<lb />
			prosecuted in the imposition of death sentence on Machhi Singh.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			256. Amongst the circumstances which so shock the collective
			<lb />
			conscience of the community that it would expect holders of the
			<lb />
			judicial power centre to inflict death penalty irrespective of their
			<lb />
			personal opinion as regards desirability or otherwise of retaining
			<lb />
			death penalty, several circumstances have been enumerated
			<lb />
			including -motive for commission of murder‖. In para 34 of the
			<lb />
			judgment, the circumstance that a -murder is committed for a
			<lb />
			motive which evince total depravity and meanness‖ is noted which
			<lb />
			is illustrated when the crime is -a cold-blooded murder‖...... -with
			<lb />
			a deliberate design‖ ....... in order to -gain control over a person
			<lb />
			under the control of the murderer or vis-a-vis whom the murderer
			<lb />
			is in a dominating position or in a position of trust‖.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			257. Another circumstance to so shock the collective conscience
			<lb />
			of the community is the -anti-social or socially abhorrent nature
			<lb />
			of the crime‖. Under this heading, murders of a scheduled caste or
			<lb />
			minority community committed in circumstances which arouse
			<lb />
			social wrath as well as cases of bride burning and what are known
			<lb />
			as dowry death have been cited. The court has also referred to
			<lb />
			-magnitude of crime‖ as such a circumstance enumerating multiple
			<lb />
			murders, say of large number of persons of a particular caste or
			<lb />
			community. We also find that in Machhi Singh, reference is made
			<lb />
			to -personality of victim of the murder‖ which is illustrated by the
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 195
			<lb />
			victim of a murder being one who -has not provided even an
			<lb />
			excuse, much less a provocation, for the murder‖.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			258. We have extracted the above opinion of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			about the divisive effect of the caste system and that it deserves to
			<lb />
			be destroyed at the earliest. The Supreme Court has noted that
			<lb />
			intercaste marriages were in fact in national interest as they would
			<lb />
			have the effect of removing caste barriers leading to social
			<lb />
			integration. It is therefore, apparent that honour killings arise out
			<lb />
			of deep sense of caste affiliations and indubitably reinforce such
			<lb />
			divisions in social structures. Such crimes not only violate the
			<lb />
			constitutional mandate but also impinge on Article 21 rights of two
			<lb />
			individuals to choose their life partners. It is in this background,
			<lb />
			that the Supreme Court has considered the caste basis of the honour
			<lb />
			killing as motivating the crime to be an important circumstance for
			<lb />
			imposing the harsh punishment of death sentence. Such an offence
			<lb />
			has been labelled as an -act of barbarism and feudal mentality‖.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			259. The judicial precedents noted above have considered all
			<lb />
			relevant factors including the brutality of the crime, etc. including
			<lb />
			its motive being to prevent intercaste alliance or to stamp out an
			<lb />
			intercaste relationship before concluding whether the crime fell
			<lb />
			within the rarest of rare category in terms of the Constitution
			<lb />
			Bench pronouncements. We therefore, find no illegality in
			<lb />
			considering a murder motivated by the consideration that murdered
			<lb />
			person/persons must be eliminated because they belong/(do not
			<lb />
			belong) to a particular caste is an important circumstance for
			<lb />
			ascertaining as to whether the case would fall in the rarest of rare
			<lb />
			category.
			<lb />
			The same is constitutionally and legally permissible and
			<lb />
			cannot be faulted. The objections on behalf of the defendants are
			<lb />
			therefore, devoid of any legal merit.

			<lb />
			appellate under Section 386 of the Cr.P.C. and the revisional
			<lb />
			powers of the High Court for enhancement of sentence are
			<lb />
			concerned, the same have been clearly delineated in the

			pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (1990) 4 SCC

			718, Govind Ramji Jadhav v. State of Maharashtra, the relevant
			<lb />
			portion of which may usefully be extracted and reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;6. &apos;Let punishment fit the crime&apos; is one of the main
			<lb />
			objects of the sentencing policy. To achieve this object,

			the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers the High

			Court to enhance the sentence in appropriate
			<lb />
			cases where the sentence awarded by the subordinate
			<lb />
			courts is grossly inadequate or unconscionably lenient or

			<lb />
			[(1979) 4 SCC 754: 1980 SCC (Cri) 174: (1980) 1 SCR
			<lb />
			645] while dealing with the revisional powers of the High
			<lb />
			Court has ruled thus: (SCC pp. 756-57, paras 10 and 11)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;... in respect of the petition which was filed under
			<lb />
			Section 401 CrPC for the exercise of the High Court&apos;s
			<lb />
			power of revision, it was permissible for it to exercise
			<lb />
			the power of a court of appeal under Section 386 for
			<lb />
			enhancement of the sentence... The High Court&apos;s power
			<lb />
			of revision in the case of any proceeding the record of
			<lb />
			which has been called for by it or which otherwise comes
			<lb />
			to its knowledge, has been stated in Section 401 CrPC to
			<lb />
			which reference has been made above. That includes the

			8. Under Section 377(1) of the Code, the State
			<lb />
			Government in any case of conviction on a trial held by
			<lb />
			any court other than the High Court is empowered to
			<lb />
			direct the public prosecutor to present an appeal to
			<lb />
			the High Court against the sentence on the ground of its
			<lb />
			inadequacy. Under sub-section (2) of Section 377, the
			<lb />
			Central Government under the circumstances stated
			<lb />
			therein is empowered to direct the public prosecutor to
			<lb />
			present an appeal to the High Court for enhancement of
			<lb />
			sentence. Before the introduction of this Section 377 on
			<lb />
			the recommendation of the Law Commission in its 41st
			<lb />
			Report, any error in sentencing could be remedied only
			<lb />
			by the exercise of the revisional power of the High
			<lb />
			Court. However, the High Court notwithstanding the
			<lb />
			exercise of its powers under the appellate jurisdiction in
			<lb />
			an appeal preferred under Section 377 of the Code have
			<lb />
			powers to act suo motu to enhance the sentence
			<lb />
			in appropriate cases while exercising its revisional
			<lb />
			jurisdiction even in the absence of an appeal against the
			<lb />
			inadequacy of the sentence as provided under Section
			<lb />
			377.

			9. In Nadir Khan v. State (Delhi Administration)
			<lb />
			[(1975) 2 SCC 406: 1975 SCC (Cri) 622] wherein a
			<lb />
			question was raised that the High Court, in revision
			<lb />
			under Section 401 CrPC has no jurisdiction or power to
			<lb />
			enhance the sentence in the absence of an appeal
			<lb />
			against the inadequacy of sentence under Section 377,
			<lb />
			Goswami J. characterised that question as an unmerited
			<lb />
			doubt on the undoubted jurisdiction of the High Court
			<lb />
			in acting suo motu in criminal revision in appropriate
			<lb />
			cases and said &quot;The attempt has to be nipped in the bud.&quot;
			<lb />
			Dealing with that question, he observed as follows: (SCC
			<lb />
			pp. 407-08, paras 4 and 5)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;It is well known and has been ever recognised that the
			<lb />
			High Court is not required to act in revision merely
			<lb />
			through a conduit application at the instance of an
			<lb />
			aggrieved party. The High Court, as an
			<lb />
			effective instrument for administration of criminal
			<lb />
			justice, keeps a constant vigil and wherever it finds that
			<lb />
			justice has suffered, it takes upon itself as its bounden
			<lb />
			duty to suo motu act where there is flagrant abuse of
			<lb />
			the law. The character of the offence and the nature of
			<lb />
			disposal of a particular case by the subordinate court
			<lb />
			prompt remedial action on the part of the High Court for
			<lb />
			the ultimate social good of the community, even though
			<lb />
			the State may be slow or silent in preferring an
			<lb />
			appeal provided for under the new Code. The High
			<lb />
			Court in a given case of public importance e.g. in now
			<lb />
			too familiar cases of food adulteration, reacts to public
			<lb />
			concern over the problem and may act suo motu on
			<lb />
			perusal of newspaper reports disclosing imposition of
			<lb />
			grossly inadequate sentence upon such offenders. This
			<lb />
			position was true and extant in the old Code of 1898 and
			<lb />
			this salutary power has not been denied by Parliament
			<lb />
			under the new Code by rearrangement of the sections. It
			<lb />
			is true the new Code has expressly given a right to the
			<lb />
			State under Section 377 CrPC to appeal against
			<lb />
			inadequacy of sentence which was not there under the
			<lb />
			old Code. That however does not exclude revisional
			<lb />
			jurisdiction of the High Court to act suo motu for
			<lb />
			enhancement of sentence in appropriate cases. What
			<lb />
			is an appropriate case has to be left to the discretion of
			<lb />
			the High Court....
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Section 401 expressly preserves the power of the
			<lb />
			High Court, by itself, to call for the records without the
			<lb />
			intervention of another agency and has kept alive the
			<lb />
			ancient exercise of power when something extraordinary
			<lb />
			comes to the knowledge of the High Court. The
			<lb />
			provisions under Section 401 read with Section
			<lb />
			386(c)(iii) CrPC are clearly supplemental to those
			<lb />
			under Section 377 whereby appeals are provided
			<lb />
			for against inadequacy of sentence at the instance of the
			<lb />
			State Government or Central Government, as the case
			<lb />
			may be.&quot;

			5)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;If the High Court was minded to enhance the sentence
			<lb />
			the proper course was to exercise suo motu powers
			<lb />
			under Section 397 read with Section 401 of the Code by
			<lb />
			issuing notice of enhancement and hearing the convicts
			<lb />
			on the question of inadequacy of sentence. Without
			<lb />
			following such procedure, it was not open to the High
			<lb />
			Court in the appeal filed by the convicts to enhance the

			the nature or the extent or the nature and extent, of the

			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			15. From the above discussion, it is clear that the High
			<lb />
			Court both in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction
			<lb />
			under Section 397 read with Section 401 CrPC and its
			<lb />
			appellate jurisdiction under Section 377 read with
			<lb />
			Section 386(c) of CrPC in matters of enhancement of

			sentence should give the accused a reasonable
			<lb />
			opportunity

			of
			<lb />
			showing

			cause
			<lb />
			against
			<lb />
			such enhancement as contemplated under the first
			<lb />
			proviso to Section 386 as well under sub-section (3) of
			<lb />
			Section 377 of the Code. As pointed out in Surjit Singh
			<lb />
			case [1984 Supp SCC 518 : 1985 SCC (Cri) 90] , the
			<lb />
			rules of natural justice as also the prescribed procedure
			<lb />

			an opportunity to be heard on the proposed action for
			<lb />
			enhancement of sentence.&quot;

			262. In a recent precedent reported at (2012) 1 SCC 10, Prithipal
			<lb />
			Singh v. State of Punjab, the Supreme Court has reiterated the
			<lb />
			legal position that the High Court is competent to suo motu
			<lb />
			enhance the sentence, albeit only after granting adequate

			opportunity of hearing to the accused. The Supreme Court had

			&quot;Scope of Section 386(e) CrPC

			<lb />
			Maharashtra [(1977) 3 SCC 25 : 1977 SCC (Cri) 410 :
			<lb />
			AIR 1977 SC 1177] this Court held: (SCC p. 28, para 6)
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

			&quot;6. We should at once remove the misgiving that the new
			<lb />
			Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, has abolished the
			<lb />
			High Court&apos;s power of enhancement of sentence by
			<lb />
			exercising revisional jurisdiction, suo motu. The
			<lb />
			provision for appeal against inadequacy of sentence by
			<lb />
			the State Government or the Central Government does
			<lb />
			not lead to such a conclusion. The High Court
		</p>
		<item>
			&apos;s power of
			<lb />
			enhancement of sentence, in an appropriate case, by
			<lb />
			exercising suo motu power of revision is still extant
			<lb />
			under Section 397 read with Section 401, Criminal
			<lb />
			Procedure Code, 1973, inasmuch as the High Court can
			<lb />
			&apos;by itself&apos; call for the record of proceedings of any
			<lb />
			inferior criminal court under its jurisdiction. The
			<lb />
			provision of Section 401(4) is a bar to a party, who does
			<lb />
			not appeal, when appeal lies, but applies in revision.
			<lb />
			Such a legal bar under Section 401(4) does not stand in
			<lb />
			the way of the High Court&apos;s exercise of power of
			<lb />
			revision, suo motu, which continues as before in the
			<lb />
			new Code.&quot;

			37. In Jayaram Vithoba v. State of Bombay [AIR 1956 SC
			<lb />
			146 : 1956 Cri LJ 318] this Court held that the suo motu
			<lb />
			powers of enhancement under revisional jurisdiction can
			<lb />
			be exercised only after giving notice/opportunity of
			<lb />
			hearing to the accused.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			38. In view of the above, the law can be summarised
			<lb />
			that the High Court in exercise of its power under
			<lb />
			Section 386(e) CrPC is competent to enhance the
			<lb />
			sentence suo motu. However, such a course is
			<lb />
			permissible only after giving opportunity of hearing to
			<lb />
			the accused.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			263. From a conjoint reading of the applicable statutory
			<lb />
			provisions with the above judicial pronouncements, there can be no
			<lb />
			pg. 204
			<lb />
			manner of doubt that if satisfied that the sentence awarded by the
			<lb />
			trial court is not commensurate with the gravity of the offence, the
			<lb />
			High Court is empowered to either on an appeal by the State or
			<lb />
			revision under Section 401 of the Cr.P.C. or to even suo motu
			<lb />
			enhance the sentence of a convict. It needs no elaboration that the
			<lb />
			High Court can do so only after issuing a specific show cause
			<lb />
			notice and grant of hearing to the convict. While exercising
			<lb />
			appellate power under Section 386, the notice would be issued in
			<lb />
			terms of the proviso to Section 386 of the Cr.P.C., in the event that
			<lb />
			any enhancement of the sentence was being contemplated. It is
			<lb />
			also trite that there is no distinction between the appellate power of
			<lb />
			the High Court and the revisional power of the court to enhance the
			<lb />
			sentence in a befitting case, in a likewise manner.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			264. In the present cases, thus so far as the State appeals on the
			<lb />
			one hand and the revision by the complainant seeking enhancement
			<lb />
			of the sentence on two of the defendants are concerned, this court
			<lb />
			is competent to enhance the sentences on them, after giving
			<lb />
			opportunity to show cause against enhancement of punishment.

		</p>
		<p>
			(IX) Sentencing procedure and pre-sentencing hearing-nature
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			265. What is the procedure to be followed by a judge post
			<lb />
			returning a finding of guilt? By the Amendment Act 26 of 1955, a
			<lb />
			significant statutory change effected was the introduction of
			<lb />
			Section 235(2) which provided that if the accused is convicted and
			<lb />
			the judge did not propose to release the convict on probation of
			<lb />
			good conduct or after admonition, it was mandatory upon the trial
			<lb />
			judge to hear the accused on the question of sentence and then pass
			<lb />
			a sentence on him according to law.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			266. This very question was posed by the Supreme court in para
			<lb />
			10 of the pronouncement reported at (1989) 3 SCC 5 Allauddin
			<lb />
			Mian and Ors. v. State of Bihar. Making a reference to the
			<lb />
			requirements of Section 235(3), in para 10 of the judgment the
			<lb />
			court held as follows:
			<lb />
			-10. ...The question then is what procedure does the
			<lb />
			judge follow for determining the punishment to be
			<lb />
			imposed in each case to fit the crime?
			<lb />
			... The requirement of hearing the accused is intended to
			<lb />
			satisfy the rule of natural justice. ...To assist the court in
			<lb />
			determining the correct sentence to be imposed the
			<lb />
			legislature introduced sub-section (2) to Section 235.
			<lb />
			The said provision therefore satisfies a dual purpose; it
			<lb />
			satisfies the rule of natural justice by according to the
			<lb />
			accused an opportunity of being heard on the question
			<lb />
			of sentence and at the same time helps the court to
			<lb />
			choose the sentence to be awarded. Since the provision
			<lb />
			is intended to give the accused an opportunity to place
			<lb />
			before the court all the relevant material having a
			<lb />
			bearing on the question of sentence there can be no
			<lb />
			doubt that the provision is salutary and must be strictly
			<lb />
			followed. It is clearly mandatory and should not be
			<lb />
			treated as a mere formality. ....We think as a general
			<lb />
			rule the trial courts should after recording the
			<lb />
			conviction adjourn the matter to a future date and call
			<lb />
			upon both the prosecution as well as the defence to
			<lb />
			place the relevant material bearing on the question of
			<lb />
			sentence before it and thereafter pronounce the
			<lb />
			sentence to be imposed on the offender. xxx‖
			<lb />
			Nadu, the court further elaborated on the scope of the opportunity
			<lb />
			under Section 235(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure holding
			<lb />
			thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-12. Undoubtedly under Section 235(2) of Cr.P.C., the
			<lb />
			accused is entitled to an opportunity to adduce
			<lb />
			evidence and if need be the case is to be adjourned to
			<lb />
			another date. It is illegal to convict, an accused and to
			<lb />
			impose sentence on the same day. It is true as
			<lb />
			contended for the State that under Section 309, third
			<lb />
			proviso brought by Amendment Act, 1978 that no
			<lb />
			adjournment should be granted for the purpose only of
			<lb />
			enabling the accused person to show cause against
			<lb />
			sentence to be imposed upon him. Under
			<lb />
			Section 235(2) when the accused has been given right to
			<lb />
			be heard on the question of sentence it is a valuable
			<lb />
			right. To make that right meaningful the procedure
			<lb />
			adopted should be suitably moulded and the accused
			<lb />
			given an opportunity to adduce evidence on the nature
			<lb />
			of the sentence. The hearing may be on the same day if
			<lb />
			the parties are ready or be adjourned to a next date but
			<lb />
			once the court after giving opportunity propose to
			<lb />
			impose appropriate sentence again there is no need to
			<lb />
			adjourn the case any further thereon. No doubt the
			<lb />
			Sessions Judge needed to adjourn the case under
			<lb />
			Section 235(2) to next date but in the High Court the
			<lb />
			counsel was directed to show any additional grounds
			<lb />
			on the question of sentence. The High Court observed
			<lb />
			that the counsel was unable to give any additional
			<lb />
			ground. xxx xxx xxx&quot;

			<lb />
			the appeal was limited to the question of sentence and the principal
			<lb />
			argument advanced on behalf of the appellant was that in not
			<lb />
			giving an opportunity to the appellant to be heard in regard to the
			<lb />
			sentence to be imposed upon him upon conviction, the learned
			<lb />
			Session Judge committed a breach of Section 235(2) of the Cr.PC.
			<lb />
			After examining in para 2 the nature of the hearing on sentence
			<lb />
			under Section 235(2), the following observations of Bhagwati, J in
			<lb />
			para 3 of this pronouncement are illuminating:
			<lb />
			-
		</p>
		<item>
			3. xxx The reason is that a proper sentence is the
			<lb />
			amalgam of many factors such as the nature of the
			<lb />
			offence,
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			circumstances--extenuating
			<lb />
			or
			<lb />
			aggravating--of the offence, the prior criminal record&apos;,
			<lb />
			if any, of the offender, the age of the offender, the
			<lb />
			record of the offender as to employment, the
			<lb />
			background of the offender with reference to
			<lb />
			education, home life, society and social adjustment,
			<lb />
			the emotional and mental condition of the offender,
			<lb />
			the prospects for the rehabilitation of the offender, the
			<lb />
			possibility of return of the offender to a normal life in
			<lb />
			the community, the possibility of treatment or training
			<lb />
			of the offender, the possibility that the sentence may
			<lb />
			serve as a deterrent to crime by the offender or by
			<lb />
			others and the current community need, if any, for
			<lb />
			such a deterrent in respect to the particular type of
			<lb />
			offence. These are factors which have to be taken into
			<lb />
			account by the court in deciding upon the appropriate
			<lb />
			sentence, and there-fore, the legislature felt that, for this
			<lb />
			purpose, a separate stage should be provided after
			<lb />
			conviction when the court can bear the accused in
			<lb />
			regard to these factors bearing on sentence and then
			<lb />
			pass proper sentence on the accused. Hence the new
			<lb />
			provision in section 235(2).‖
			<lb />

		<p>
			269. The court in Santa Singh further discussed the question as to
			<lb />
			what would constitute full and adequate material as well as the
			<lb />
			meaning of the expression -hearing the accused‖ in Section 235 in
			<lb />
			the following terms:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;4. ...We have set out a large number of factors which
			<lb />
			go into the alchemy which ultimately produces an
			<lb />
			appropriate sentence and full and adequate material
			<lb />
			relating to these factors would have to be brought before
			<lb />
			the court in order to enable the court to pass an
			<lb />
			appropriate sentence. This material may be placed
			<lb />
			before the court by means of affidavits, but if either
			<lb />
			party disputes the correctness or veracity of the
			<lb />
			material sought to be produced by the other, an
			<lb />
			opportunity would have to be given to the party
			<lb />
			concerned to lead evidence for the purpose of bringing
			<lb />
			such material on record. The hearing on the question
			<lb />
			of sentence, would be rendered devoid of all meaning
			<lb />
			and content and it would become an idle formality, if it
			<lb />
			were confined merely to hearing oral submissions
			<lb />
			without any opportunity being given to the parties and
			<lb />
			particularly to the accused, to produce material in
			<lb />
			regard to various factors bearing on the question of
			<lb />
			sentence, and if necessary, to lead evidence for the
			<lb />
			purpose of placing such material before the court. This
			<lb />
			was also the opinion expressed by the Law Commission
			<lb />
			in its Forty Eighth Report where it was stated that &quot;the
			<lb />
			taking of evidence as to the circumstances relevant to
			<lb />
			sentencing should be encouraged and both the
			<lb />
			prosecution and the accused should be allowed to
			<lb />
			cooperate in the process.&quot; The Law Commission
			<lb />
			strongly recommended that if a request is made in that
			<lb />
			behalf by either the prosecution or the accused, an
			<lb />
			opportunity for leading &quot;evidence on the question&quot; of
			<lb />
			sentence &quot;should be given&quot;. We are, therefore, of the
			<lb />
			view
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			hearing
			<lb />
			contemplated

			by
			<lb />
			Section 235(2) is not confined merely to hearing oral

			submissions, but it is also intended to give an

			court to see that this hearing on the question of sentence

			is not abused and turned into an instrument for

			270. Exercise of judicial discretion for examining a just
			<lb />
			punishment cannot be unguided. The question as to what material
			<lb />
			should be examined by the Judge while exercising such discretion
			<lb />
			has come up for consideration in the judicial pronouncement
			<lb />
			reported at (2013) 7 SCC 545 Gopal Singh vs. State of
			<lb />
			Uttarakhand which has been placed by Mr. Rajesh Mahajan,
			<lb />
			learned Additional Standing Counsel for the State. In para 18, the
			<lb />
			court set out the issues which must be examined while the duty of
			<lb />
			the court was spelt out in para 19 in the following terms:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-18. Just punishment is the collective cry of the
			<lb />
			society. While the collective cry has to be kept
			<lb />
			uppermost in the mind, simultaneously the principle of
			<lb />
			proportionality between the crime and punishment
			<lb />
			cannot be totally brushed aside. The principle of just
			<lb />
			punishment is the bedrock of sentencing in respect of a
			<lb />
			criminal offence. A punishment should not be
			<lb />
			disproportionately excessive. The concept of
			<lb />
			proportionality allows a significant discretion to the
			<lb />
			Judge but the same has to be guided by certain
			<lb />
			principles. In certain cases, the nature of culpability,
			<lb />
			the antecedents of the accused, the factum of age, the
			<lb />
			potentiality of the convict to become a criminal in
			<lb />
			future, capability of his reformation and to lead an
			<lb />
			acceptable life in the prevalent milieu, the effect-
			<lb />
			propensity to become a social threat or nuisance, and
			<lb />
			sometimes lapse of time in the commission of the
			<lb />
			crime and his conduct in the interregnum bearing in
			<lb />
			mind the nature of the offence, the relationship between
			<lb />
			the parties and attractability of the doctrine of
			<lb />
			bringing the convict to the value-based social
			<lb />
			mainstream may be the guiding factors. Needless to
			<lb />
			emphasize, these are certain illustrative aspects put
			<lb />
			forth in a condensed manner. We may hasten to add that
			<lb />
			there can neither be a strait-jacket formula nor a
			<lb />
			solvable theory in mathematical exactitude. It would
			<lb />
			be dependant on the facts of the case and rationalized
			<lb />
			judicial discretion. Neither the personal perception of a
			<lb />
			Judge nor self-adhered moralistic vision nor
			<lb />
			hypothetical apprehensions should be allowed to have
			<lb />
			any play. For every offence, a drastic measure cannot be
			<lb />
			thought of. Similarly, an offender cannot be allowed to
			<lb />
			be treated with leniency solely on the ground of
			<lb />
			discretion vested in a Court. The real requisite is to
			<lb />
			weigh the circumstances in which the crime has been
			<lb />
			committed and other concomitant factors which we
			<lb />
			have indicated hereinbefore and also have been stated in
			<lb />
			a number of pronouncements by this Court. On such
			<lb />
			touchstone, the sentences are to be imposed. The
			<lb />
			discretion should not be in the realm of fancy. It should
			<lb />
			be embedded in the conceptual essence of just
			<lb />
			punishment.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			19. A Court, while imposing sentence, has to keep in
			<lb />
			view the various complex matters in mind. To
			<lb />
			structure a methodology relating to sentencing is
			<lb />
			difficult to conceive of. The legislature in its wisdom
			<lb />
			has conferred discretion on the Judge who is guided by
			<lb />
			certain rational parameters, regard been had to the
			<lb />
			factual scenario of the case. In certain spheres the
			<lb />
			legislature has not conferred that discretion and in
			<lb />
			such circumstances, the discretion is conditional. In
			<lb />
			respect of certain offences, sentence can be reduced by
			<lb />
			giving adequate special reasons. The special reasons
			<lb />
			have to rest on real special circumstances. Hence, the
			<lb />
			duty of Court in such situations becomes a complex
			<lb />
			one. The same has to be performed with due reverence
			<lb />
			for Rule of Law and the collective conscience on one
			<lb />
			hand and the doctrine of proportionality, principle of
			<lb />
			reformation and other concomitant factors on the other.
			<lb />
			The task may be onerous but the same has to be done
			<lb />
			with total empirical rationality sans any kind of personal
			<lb />
			philosophy or individual experience or any a-priori
			<lb />
			notion.‖

			<lb />
			Sentencing procedure for convictions where death sentence
			<lb />
			may be imposed
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			271. So far as awarding of death sentence is concerned, the statute
			<lb />
			mandates and the Supreme Court has held that in accordance with
			<lb />
			Section 235(2), the sentencing court must record special reasons
			<lb />
			for awarding the death sentence. So far as sentencing in serious
			<lb />
			offences for which a death sentence can be handed out, one of the
			<lb />
			tests advocated is the criminal test which requires consideration of
			<lb />
			the circumstances of the criminal. How is this to be effected?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			272. It is necessary to note the importance of the pre-sentence
			<lb />
			hearing; recording of special reasons and the role of the courts in
			<lb />
			awarding the death sentence, as stands emphasized by the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in (2009) 6 SCC 498, Santosh Kumar Satish Bhushan
			<lb />
			Bariyar v. State of Maharashtra. We may usefully borrow the
			<lb />
			words of the Supreme Court in paras 55 and 56 of this
			<lb />
			pronouncement which read as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Pre-sentence hearing and -special reasons‖
			<lb />
			55. Under Sections 235(2) and 354(3) of the Criminal
			<lb />
			Procedure Code, there is a mandate as to a full-fledged
			<lb />
			bifurcated hearing and recording of -special reasons‖
			<lb />
			if the court inclines to award death penalty. In the
			<lb />
			specific backdrop of sentencing in capital punishment,
			<lb />
			and that the matter attracts constitutional prescription in
			<lb />
			full force, it is incumbent on the sentencing court to
			<lb />
			oversee comprehensive compliance with both the
			<lb />
			provisions. A scrupulous compliance with both
			<lb />
			provisions is necessary such that an informed selection
			<lb />
			of sentence could be based on the information
			<lb />
			collected and collated at this stage. Please see Santa
			<lb />
			Singh v. State of Punjab [AIR 1956 SC 256] , Malkiat
			<lb />
			Singh v. State of Punjab [(1991) 4 SCC 341 : 1991 SCC

			Nature of information to be collated at pre-sentence
			<lb />
			hearing
			<lb />
			56. At this stage, Bachan Singh [(1980) 2 SCC 684 :
			<lb />
			1980 SCC (Cri) 580] informs the content of the
			<lb />
			sentencing hearing. The court must play a proactive
			<lb />
			role to record all relevant information at this stage.
			<lb />
			Some of the information relating to crime can be culled
			<lb />
			out from the phase prior to sentencing hearing. This
			<lb />
			information would include aspects relating to the
			<lb />
			nature, motive and impact of crime, culpability of
			<lb />
			convict, etc. Quality of evidence adduced is also a
			<lb />
			relevant factor. For instance, extent of reliance on
			<lb />
			circumstantial evidence or child witness plays an
			<lb />
			important role in the sentencing analysis. But what is
			<lb />
			sorely lacking, in most capital sentencing cases, is
			<lb />
			information relating to characteristics and socio-
			<lb />
			economic background of the offender. This issue was
			<lb />
			also raised in the 48 th Report of the Law Commission.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			57. Circumstances which may not have been pertinent
			<lb />
			in conviction can also play an important role in the
			<lb />
			selection of sentence. Objective analysis of the
			<lb />
			probability that the accused can be reformed and
			<lb />
			rehabilitated can be one such illustration. In this context,
			<lb />
			Guideline 4 in the list of mitigating circumstances as
			<lb />
			borne out by Bachan Singh [(1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980
			<lb />
			SCC (Cri) 580] is relevant. The Court held: (SCC p.
			<lb />
			750, para 206)
			<lb />
			-206. (4) The probability that the accused can be
			<lb />
			reformed and rehabilitated.
			<lb />
			The State shall by evidence prove that the accused
			<lb />
			does not satisfy Conditions (3) and (4) above.‖
			<lb />
			In fine, Bachan Singh [(1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC
			<lb />
			(Cri) 580] mandated identification of aggravating and
			<lb />
			mitigating circumstance relating to crime and the
			<lb />
			convict to be collected in the sentencing hearing.‖

			273. In (2013) 10 SCC 421, Deepak Rai v. State of Bihar, the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court has held -that it cannot be accepted that the failure
			<lb />
			on the part of the court which has convicted the accused and heard
			<lb />
			him on the question of sentence but failed to express the &quot;special
			<lb />
			reasons&quot;, in so many words must necessarily entail a remand to
			<lb />
			that court for elaboration upon its conclusion in awarding the
			<lb />
			death sentence for the reason that while exercising appellate
			<lb />
			jurisdiction the Supreme Court cannot delve into such reasons‖.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			274. Mr. Rajesh Mahajan, learned Additional Standing Counsel
			<lb />
			has placed reliance on the recent pronouncement of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court reported at (2014) 3 SCC 421 : 2014 (2) SCALE 293, Birju
			<lb />
			v. State of M.P. wherein the court has considered the impact of
			<lb />
			previous criminal record of the accused on sentencing. In this case,
			<lb />
			Birju was involved in 24 criminal cases of which three were filed
			<lb />
			for the offence of murder. The court awarded sentence of 20 years
			<lb />
			rigorous imprisonment without remission over the period he had
			<lb />
			already undergone. It was observed that the motive for committing
			<lb />
			the murder in the case was for getting money to consume liquor for
			<lb />
			which a child of one year became casualty. The trial court had
			<lb />
			imposed death sentence upon the appellant which was confirmed
			<lb />
			by the High Court holding that there was no probability that the
			<lb />
			accused would not commit the act of violence in future and his
			<lb />
			presence would be a continuing threat to the society. The High
			<lb />
			Court had also taken a view that there was no possibility of
			<lb />
			reformation or rehabilitation of the accused (para 4). So far as
			<lb />
			prior record of implication in criminal cases is concerned, in para
			<lb />
			15, the court observed as follows:
			<lb />
			-15. ...May be, in a given case, the pendency of large
			<lb />
			number of criminal cases against the accused person
			<lb />
			might be a factor which could be taken note of in
			<lb />
			awarding a sentence but, in any case, not a relevant
			<lb />
			factor for awarding capital punishment. True, when
			<lb />
			there are more than two dozen cases, of which three
			<lb />
			relate to the offence of murder, the usual plea of false
			<lb />
			implication by the defence has to be put on the back
			<lb />
			seat, and may have an impact on the sentencing policy,
			<lb />
			since the presence of the accused could be a continuing
			<lb />
			threat to the society and hence calls for longer period of
			<lb />
			incarceration.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			275. In para 17 of Birju, the court has emphasized that prior
			<lb />
			record of conviction in heinous crimes like murder, rape, armed
			<lb />
			docoity etc. will be a relevant factor but that conviction should
			<lb />
			have attained finality so as to treat it as aggravating circumstance
			<lb />
			for awarding death sentence. Paras 17, 18 and 19 of the judgment
			<lb />
			shed light on the issue under consideration and read as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;17. We have in Shankar Kisanrao Khade case [Shankar
			<lb />
			Kisanrao Khade v.State of Maharashtra, (2013) 5 SCC
			<lb />
			546 : (2013) 3 SCC (Cri) 402] dealt with the question as
			<lb />
			to whether the previous criminal record of the accused
			<lb />
			would be an aggravating circumstance to be taken note
			<lb />
			of while awarding death sentence and held that the mere
			<lb />
			pendency of few criminal cases, as such, is not an
			<lb />
			aggravating circumstance to be taken note of while
			<lb />
			awarding death sentence, since the accused is not found
			<lb />
			guilty and convicted in those cases. In the instant case, it
			<lb />
			was stated, that the accused was involved in 24 criminal
			<lb />
			cases, out of which three were registered against the
			<lb />
			accused for murder and two cases of attempting to
			<lb />
			commit murder and, in all those cases, the accused was
			<lb />
			charge-sheeted for trial before the court of law. No
			<lb />
			materials have been produced before us to show that the
			<lb />
			accused stood convicted in any of those cases. The
			<lb />
			accused has only been charge-sheeted and not
			<lb />
			convicted, hence, that factor is not a relevant factor to be
			<lb />
			taken note of while applying the R-R test so as to award
			<lb />
			capital punishment. Maybe, in a given case, the
			<lb />
			pendency of large number of criminal cases against the
			<lb />
			accused person might be a factor which could be taken
			<lb />
			note of in awarding a sentence but, in any case, not a
			<lb />
			relevant factor for awarding capital punishment. True,
			<lb />
			when there are more than two dozen cases, of which
			<lb />
			three relate to the offence of murder, the usual plea of
			<lb />
			false implication by the defence has to be put on the
			<lb />
			back seat, and may have an impact on the sentencing
			<lb />
			policy, since the presence of the accused could be a
			<lb />
			continuing threat to the society and hence calls for
			<lb />
			longer period of incarceration.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			18. We also notice, while laying down various criteria for
			<lb />
			determining the aggravating circumstances, two aspects,
			<lb />
			often seen referred to in Bachan Singh v.State of
			<lb />
			Punjab [(1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC (Cri)
			<lb />
			580], Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab [(1983) 3 SCC
			<lb />
			470 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 681] and Rajendra Pralhadrao
			<lb />
			Wasnikv. State of Maharashtra [(2012) 4 SCC 37 :
			<lb />
			(2012) 2 SCC (Cri) 30] , are (1) the offences relating to
			<lb />
			the commission of heinous crime like murder, rape,
			<lb />
			armed dacoity, kidnapping, etc. by the accused with a
			<lb />
			prior record of conviction for capital felony or offences
			<lb />
			committed by the person having a substantial history of
			<lb />
			serious assaults and criminal conviction; and (2) the
			<lb />
			offence was committed while the offender was engaged
			<lb />
			in the commission of another serious offence. The first
			<lb />
			criterion may be a relevant factor while applying the R-R
			<lb />
			test, provided the offences relating to heinous crimes like
			<lb />
			murder, rape, dacoity, etc. have ended in conviction.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			19. We may first examine whether -substantial history
			<lb />
			of serious assaults and criminal conviction‖ is an
			<lb />
			aggravating circumstance when the court is dealing with
			<lb />
			the offences relating to the heinous crimes like murder,
			<lb />
			rape, armed dacoity, etc. Prior record of the conviction,
			<lb />
			in our view, will be a relevant factor, but that conviction
			<lb />
			should have attained finality so as to treat it as
			<lb />
			aggravating circumstance for awarding death sentence.
			<lb />
			The second aspect deals with a situation where an
			<lb />
			offence was committed, while the offender was engaged
			<lb />
			in the commission of another serious offence. This is a
			<lb />
			situation where the accused is engaged in the commission
			<lb />
			of another serious offence which has not ended in
			<lb />
			conviction and attained finality.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
			Therefore, pendency of other criminal cases against a
			<lb />
			convict is a relevant factor for sentencing but not for awarding the
			<lb />
			death sentence. It is conviction in serious offences which has
			<lb />
			attained finality which would be treated as an aggravating
			<lb />
			circumstance for awarding capital punishment.
			<lb />

		<p>
			276. So far as the role and responsibility of the courts i.e. the trial
			<lb />
			court or the High Court are concerned, the following enunciation in
			<lb />
			para 69 of the pronouncement in (2009) 6 SCC 498, Santosh
			<lb />
			Kumar Satish Bhushan Bariyar v. State of Maharashtra by the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court sheds valuable light and reads thus:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-2(D) Role and responsibility of courts
			<lb />
			69.
			<lb />
			Bachan Singh [(1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC
			<lb />
			(Cri) 580] while enunciating the rarest of rare doctrine,
			<lb />
			did not deal with the role and responsibility of
			<lb />
			sentencing court and the appellate court separately.
			<lb />
			For that matter, this Court did not specify any review
			<lb />
			standards for the High Court and the Supreme Court. In
			<lb />
			that event, all courts, be it the trial court, the High
			<lb />
			Court or this Court, are duty-bound to ensure that the
			<lb />
			ratio laid down therein is scrupulously followed. Same
			<lb />
			standard of rigour and fairness are to be followed by
			<lb />
			the courts. If anything, inverse pyramid of
			<lb />
			responsibility is applicable in death penalty cases.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			70. In State of Maharashtra v. Sindhi [(1975) 1 SCC
			<lb />
			647 : 1975 SCC (Cri) 283] this Court reiterated, with
			<lb />
			emphasis, that while dealing with a reference for
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 218
			<lb />
			confirmation of a sentence of death, the High Court
			<lb />
			must consider the proceedings in all their aspects,
			<lb />
			reappraise, reassess and reconsider the entire facts
			<lb />
			and law and, if necessary, after taking additional
			<lb />
			evidence, come to its own conclusions on the material
			<lb />
			on record in regard to the conviction of the accused
			<lb />
			(and the sentence) independently of the view expressed
			<lb />
			by the Sessions Judge.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			277. After an elaborate discussion, the court provided the
			<lb />
			following framework for pre-sentencing in Bariyar :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The trial court; high court as well as the Supreme Court have
			<lb />
			the same powers and responsibilities. (para 69)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) Aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the case before
			<lb />
			the sentencing court should first be identified.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii) The second step would be to compare the aggravating and
			<lb />
			mitigating circumstances in the case before the court with a
			<lb />
			pool of comparable cases. This would ensure that the court
			<lb />
			considers similarly placed cases together. In this exercise,
			<lb />
			similarity with respect to gravity of the crime, nature of the
			<lb />
			crime, and the motive of the offender might be considered.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			On this basis, the sentencing court might be able to identify
			<lb />
			how a similar case has been dealt with by the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			in a previous instance.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(iv) The court further held that the weight that the sentencing
			<lb />
			court gives to each individual aggravating or mitigating
			<lb />
			factor might vary from case to case. However, it is
			<lb />
			imperative that the sentencing court provide legal reasons for
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 219
			<lb />
			the weight that it has accorded to each such aggravating or
			<lb />
			mitigating factor. The court opined that this exercise may
			<lb />
			point out excessiveness, and at the same time reduce
			<lb />
			arbitrariness in sentencing. The court further noted that this
			<lb />
			exercise should definitely be undertaken in cases where the
			<lb />
			sentencing court opts to impose the death sentence on the
			<lb />
			convicted person.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(v) Though Bariyar involves a death sentence, however, the
			<lb />
			principles laid down (or reiterated) by the court with regard
			<lb />
			to nature of the pre-sentencing hearing, the considerations
			<lb />
			which must weigh as well as the responsibility of the trial
			<lb />
			courts and high courts would apply to pre-sentencing hearing
			<lb />
			in other offences and sentences as well.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			278. An essential requirement laid down in all the judgments
			<lb />
			considering imposition of the death penalty is the requirement of
			<lb />
			being satisfied about the probability that the accused would not
			<lb />
			commit criminal acts of violence and the probability that the
			<lb />
			accused could not be reformed and rehabilitated. A difference of
			<lb />
			opinion arose between the two learned judges on the award of
			<lb />
			death penalty in the consideration which was reported at (2009) 5
			<lb />
			SCC 740, Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod (1) v. State of
			<lb />
			Gujarat. The matter was thereafter taken up for consideration by a
			<lb />
			three Judge Bench which decision was reported at (2011) 2 SCC
			<lb />
			764, Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod (2) v. State of Gujarat
			<lb />
			wherein the court favoured the commutation. Most important is
			<lb />
			the observation that it was obligatory on the trial court to have
			<lb />
			given a finding as to a possible rehabilitation of the accused and
			<lb />
			the probability that the accused can become a useful member of the
			<lb />
			society in case the accused is given a chance to do so. The relevant
			<lb />
			portion of the judgment is as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;9. Both the Hon&apos;ble Judges have relied extensively
			<lb />
			on Dhananjoy Chatterjee case [(1994) 2 SCC 220 :
			<lb />
			1994 SCC (Cri) 358]. In this case the death sentence had
			<lb />
			been awarded by the trial court on similar facts and
			<lb />
			confirmed by the Calcutta High Court and the appeal
			<lb />
			too dismissed by this Court leading to the execution of
			<lb />
			the accused. Ganguly, J. has, however, drawn a
			<lb />
			distinction on the facts of that case and the present one
			<lb />
			and held that as the appellant was a young man, only 27
			<lb />
			years of age, it was obligatory on the trial court to have
			<lb />
			given a finding as to a possible rehabilitation and
			<lb />
			reformation and the possibility that he could still
			<lb />
			become a useful member of society in case he was given
			<lb />
			a chance to do so.‖
			<lb />

		<p>
			279. The above issue has been deliberated at length by the
			<lb />
			Division Bench of this court in the decision dated 17 th April, 2014
			<lb />
			in Death Sentence Ref.No.1/2013, State v. Bharat Singh and the
			<lb />
			connected appeals filed by Bharat Singh. The court had upheld the
			<lb />
			conviction and after a detailed consideration of the aforenoticed
			<lb />
			pronouncements found that no material had been placed by the
			<lb />
			State before the court with regard to probability as to whether the
			<lb />
			convict would be likely to indulge in criminal activity or whether
			<lb />
			there is any possibility of his being reformed or rehabilitated. The
			<lb />
			court had accordingly directed the Secretary, Home Department of
			<lb />
			the Government of NCT of Delhi to assign one Probationary
			<lb />
			Officer to submit a report on these aspects specifically to the court.
			<lb />
			In para 69, the court had noted certain points for guidance of the
			<lb />
			probation officer about the manner in which he should go for his
			<lb />
			task of preparing and presenting his report and in para 70 had
			<lb />
			pointed out the handbook on the -Prevention of Recidivism and
			<lb />
			Social Integration of Offenders‖ brought out by United Nations
			<lb />
			Office on Drugs and Crimes in December, 2012 as well as other
			<lb />
			documents which would be useful in ascertaining the recent trend
			<lb />
			in assessment of an offender&apos;s risk of re-offending and the &quot;risk-
			<lb />
			needs-responsivity framework&quot; which helps such evaluation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			280. It is therefore, an important part of the sentencing function of
			<lb />
			the State in the trial as well as the court to ensure that the State
			<lb />
			places materials before the trial court regarding the probability that
			<lb />
			the convict could be reformed and rehabilitated and that he would
			<lb />
			not commit criminal acts. However, the State may, as in most
			<lb />
			cases, fail to do so. What is the court required to do? This issue
			<lb />
			has been deliberated upon by the Supreme Court in Birju wherein
			<lb />
			guidance on the manner in which the court may obtain additional
			<lb />
			material relevant for sentencing is given. In this case, the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court has made it mandatory for the courts to call for a report from
			<lb />
			the probationary officer in the following terms wherein the court
			<lb />
			observed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;20. In the instant case, the High Court took the view
			<lb />
			that there was no probability that the accused would not
			<lb />
			commit criminal acts of violence and would constitute a
			<lb />
			continuing threat to the society and there would be no
			<lb />
			probability that the accused could be reformed or
			<lb />
			rehabilitated. xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx We find, in
			<lb />
			several cases, the trial court while applying the Criminal
			<lb />
			Test, without any material on hand, either will hold that
			<lb />
			there would be no possibility of the accused indulging in
			<lb />
			commission of crime or that he would indulge in such
			<lb />
			offences in future and, therefore, it would not be
			<lb />
			possible to reform or rehabilitate him. Courts used to
			<lb />
			apply reformative theory in certain minor offences and
			<lb />
			while convicting persons, the courts sometimes release
			<lb />
			the accused on probation in terms of Section 360 CrPC
			<lb />
			and Sections 3 and 4 of the Probation of Offenders Act,
			<lb />
			1958. Sections 13 and 14 of the Act provide for
			<lb />
			appointment of Probation Officers and the nature of
			<lb />
			duties to be performed. Courts also, while exercising
			<lb />
			power under Section 4, call for a report from the
			<lb />
			Probation Officer. In our view, while awarding
			<lb />
			sentence, in appropriate cases, while hearing the
			<lb />
			accused under Section 235(2) CrPC, courts can also
			<lb />
			call for a report from the Probation Officer, while
			<lb />
			applying the Criminal Test Guideline 3 [Ed.: See para
			<lb />
			49 of Shankar Kisanrao Khade v. State of Maharashtra,
			<lb />
			(2013) 5 SCC 546 : (2013) 3 SCC (Cri) 402 under
			<lb />
			heading -Mitigating circumstances -(Criminal
			<lb />
			test)(1)-(2)***(3) The chances of the accused of not
			<lb />
			indulging in commission of the crime again and the
			<lb />
			probability of the accused being reformed and
			<lb />
			rehabilitated.‖] , as laid down in Shankar Kisanrao
			<lb />
			Khade case [Shankar Kisanrao Khade v. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra, (2013) 5 SCC 546 : (2013) 3 SCC (Cri)
			<lb />
			402] . Courts can then examine whether the accused is
			<lb />
			likely to indulge in commission of any crime or there is
			<lb />
			any probability of the accused being reformed and
			<lb />
			rehabilitated.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			281. On the aspect of failure by the State instrumentalities to
			<lb />
			place materials regarding the possibility of reformation, the court
			<lb />
			unequivocally declared the manner in which criminal courts must
			<lb />
			proceed in the judgment of the Supreme Court reported at (2014) 4
			<lb />
			SCC 69, Anil @ Anthony Arikswamy Joseph v. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra. It was held as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;33. In Bachan Singh [Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab,
			<lb />
			(1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 580] this Court has
			<lb />
			categorically stated, -the probability that the accused
			<lb />
			would not commit criminal acts of violence as would
			<lb />
			constitute a continuing threat to the society‖, is a
			<lb />
			relevant circumstance, that must be given great weight
			<lb />
			in the determination of sentence. This was further
			<lb />
			expressed
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			Santosh
			<lb />
			Kumar
			<lb />
			Satishbhushan
			<lb />
			Bariyar [Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar v. State
			<lb />
			of Maharashtra, (2009) 6 SCC 498 : (2009) 2 SCC (Cri)
			<lb />
			1150]. Many a times, while determining the sentence,
			<lb />
			the courts take it for granted, looking into the facts of a
			<lb />
			particular case, that the accused would be a menace to
			<lb />
			the society and there is no possibility of reformation and
			<lb />
			rehabilitation, while it is the duty of the court to
			<lb />
			ascertain those factors, and the State is obliged to
			<lb />
			furnish materials for and against the possibility of
			<lb />
			reformation and rehabilitation of the accused. The facts,
			<lb />
			which the courts deal with, in a given case, cannot be
			<lb />
			the foundation for reaching such a conclusion, which,
			<lb />
			as already stated, calls for additional materials. We,
			<lb />
			therefore, direct that the criminal courts, while dealing
			<lb />
			with the offences like Section 302 IPC, after
			<lb />
			conviction, may, in appropriate cases, call for a report
			<lb />
			to determine, whether the accused could be reformed
			<lb />
			or rehabilitated, which depends upon the facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of each case.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />

		<p>
			282. In para 53 of Bariyar, the Supreme Court observed that the
			<lb />
			sentencing procedure deserves an -articulate and judicial
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

			pg. 224
			<lb />
			administration‖. It was further observed that -all courts are
			<lb />
			equally responsible‖. The consideration by the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			para 53, 55, 56 and 57 of the report shed valuable light on the
			<lb />
			concerns arising and the principles which must be followed by the
			<lb />
			sentencing courts which read as under:-
			<lb />
			-53. The analytical tangle relating to sentencing
			<lb />
			procedure deserves some attention here. Sentencing
			<lb />
			procedure deserves an articulate and judicial
			<lb />
			administration. In this regard, all courts are equally
			<lb />
			responsible. Sentencing process should be so complied
			<lb />
			with, that enough information is generated to
			<lb />
			objectively inform the selection of penalty. The
			<lb />
			selection of penalty must not require a judge to reflect
			<lb />
			on his/her personal perception of crime.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			54. In Swamy
			<lb />
			Shraddananda
			<lb />
			(2) v. State
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			Karnataka [(2008) 13 SCC 767 : (2008) 10 Scale 669]
			<lb />
			(SCC p. 790, para 51), the Court notes that the awarding
			<lb />
			of sentence of death -depends a good deal on the
			<lb />
			personal predilection of the Judges constituting the
			<lb />
			Bench‖. This is a serious admission on the part of this
			<lb />
			Court. Insofar as this aspect is considered, there is
			<lb />
			inconsistency in how Bachan Singh[(1980) 2 SCC 684 :
			<lb />
			1980 SCC (Cri) 580] has been implemented, as Bachan
			<lb />
			Singh[(1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 580]
			<lb />
			mandated principled sentencing and not judge-centric
			<lb />
			sentencing. There are two sides of the debate. It is
			<lb />
			accepted that the rarest of the rare case is to be
			<lb />
			determined in the facts and circumstance of a given case
			<lb />
			and there is no hard-and-fast rule for that purpose. There
			<lb />
			are no strict guidelines. But a sentencing procedure is
			<lb />
			suggested. This procedure is in the nature of safeguards
			<lb />
			and has an overarching embrace of the rarest of
			<lb />
			rare dictum. Therefore, it is to be read with Articles 21
			<lb />
			and 14.&quot;

			283. The pronouncements in Santosh Kumar Satish Bhushan
			<lb />
			Bariyar, Shankar Kisanrao Khade, Birju &amp; Anr. and Anil @
			<lb />
			Anthony Arikswamy Joseph Anthony state the manner in which
			<lb />
			the criminal court must proceed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			284. In Death Sentence Ref.5/2012, State v. Om Prakash,
			<lb />
			decided on 17 th April, 2014, the Division Bench of this court has
			<lb />
			observed that though there were aggravating circumstances in
			<lb />
			terms of the Supreme Court pronouncements, no material had been
			<lb />
			placed on record by the State to show that the convicts were
			<lb />
			persons who cannot be reformed or are a menace to the society. In
			<lb />
			para 56, the Division Bench of this court has observed that
			<lb />
			indubitably even if no such material had been placed during the
			<lb />
			trial the same could have been placed in the present proceedings
			<lb />
			(the death reference as well as the appeals against the conviction
			<lb />
			and sentence by the convicts). The Division Bench has observed
			<lb />
			as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-56. Indubitably, even if no such material had been
			<lb />
			placed during the trial the same could have been
			<lb />
			placed in the present proceedings. In Deepak Rai v.
			<lb />
			State of Bihar the Supreme Court expressly held that it
			<lb />
			cannot be accepted that the failure on the part of the
			<lb />
			Court which has convicted an accused and heard on the
			<lb />
			question of sentence but failed to express the -special
			<lb />
			reasons‖ in so many words must necessarily entail
			<lb />
			remand to that Court for elaboration upon its conclusion
			<lb />
			in awarding the death sentence for the reason that while
			<lb />
			exercising appellate jurisdiction, the superior Court
			<lb />
			could have dealt into such reasons. Further the
			<lb />
			proceedings before this Court are a continuation of the
			<lb />
			trial as the death sentence can be awarded only if this
			<lb />
			Court answers the reference positively and confirms
			<lb />
			the death sentence. Thus, even at this stage, the State
			<lb />
			or the accused is at liberty to place on record material
			<lb />
			to show if any of the aggravating or mitigating factor
			<lb />
			has been ignored. However, we find that there is no
			<lb />
			additional material on record placed by the State in the
			<lb />
			present proceedings. In case the State fails to produce
			<lb />
			any material, the Court could ascertain from the
			<lb />
			material on record if there are any mitigating factors
			<lb />
			favouring the accused. xxx xxx xxx‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
			In Om Prakash, this court also looked at the nominal roll on
			<lb />
			record and noted that their overall conduct in jail was satisfactory
			<lb />
			and that there were no complaints against them.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			285. In State v. Om Prakash, the Division Bench noted that &quot;for
			<lb />
			the purposes of reference proceedings for confirmation of the death
			<lb />
			sentence under Section 366 Cr.P.C., the criminal court would
			<lb />
			include the High Courts as well&quot;. The criminal court has to
			<lb />
			necessarily include the High Courts exercising appellate
			<lb />
			jurisdiction under Section 386 and revisional jurisdiction
			<lb />
			considering issues of enhancement of sentences to death sentences
			<lb />
			or challenges to death sentences.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			286. Therefore, Section 235(2) confers a valuable right on the
			<lb />
			convict upon conviction, of a meaningful hearing and grant of an
			<lb />
			opportunity to place necessary material even by leading evidence
			<lb />
			to enable the sentencing court to impose an appropriate sentence on
			<lb />
			him, keeping not only the nature of offence but all relevant
			<lb />
			circumstances in mind. Upon pronouncing the judgment of
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 227
			<lb />
			conviction, the sentencing court is required to adjourn the matter
			<lb />
			for this purpose. Care is required to be taken to ensure that the
			<lb />
			opportunity of hearing Section 235(2) is not abused by the convict
			<lb />
			and the hearing is not unduly protracted.
			<lb />
			In addition, so far as cases where the sentencing court is
			<lb />
			examining whether death penalty should be imposed, while hearing
			<lb />
			the accused under Section 235(2) the courts may require a report
			<lb />
			from a competent probationary officer to make an independent
			<lb />
			evaluation regarding the possibility of reform and rehabilitation of
			<lb />
			the convict. This report could be utilized to assist the court in
			<lb />
			examining whether the convict is likely to indulge in criminal
			<lb />
			activity or whether there is possibility of his reformation and
			<lb />
			arriving at its own conclusions taking all relevant factors in mind.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			287. A deep analysis of the judicial pronouncements has been
			<lb />
			effected by a coordinate Bench in the decision dated 17 th April,
			<lb />
			2014 in Death Sentence Ref.No.1/2013, State v. Bharat Singh and
			<lb />
			the connected appeals filed by Bharat Singh and others.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			288. Sentencing procedure for which all courts are equally
			<lb />
			responsible deserves an articulate and judicial administration.
			<lb />
			Sentencing process should be so complied with, that enough
			<lb />
			information is generated to objectively inform the selection of
			<lb />
			penalty. [Ref.: (2009) 6 SCC 498, Santosh Kumar Satish
			<lb />
			Bhushan Bariyar v. State of Maharashtra (para 53)]
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			289. The procedure must be non-arbitrary and should conform to
			<lb />
			the requirements of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 228
			<lb />
			ensuring the rights of the convict under Article 21 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			290. We may note that no methodology is provided by the statute
			<lb />
			with regard to the manner in which the court is to proceed at the
			<lb />
			stage of sentencing. Learned counsels appearing in the case have
			<lb />
			incisively taken us through the judicial precedents on the above
			<lb />
			subject. We feel it our duty to cull out the principles laid down
			<lb />
			therein which would guide courts at the stage of conducting the
			<lb />
			sentencing hearing to comply with the requirement of Section
			<lb />
			235(2) of the Cr.P.C. We set down hereafter the methodology
			<lb />
			from the judicial pronouncements noted by us above:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			After returning a finding of guilt for the commission
			<lb />
			of offences with which person is charged, the trial court is
			<lb />
			required to give an opportunity to the convict under Section
			<lb />
			235(2) Cr.P.C. to make submissions, which is a valuable
			<lb />
			right, on the question of a sentence.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) The hearing may be on the same day if the parties are
			<lb />
			ready or the case be adjourned to a next date. [Ref. (1991) 3
			<lb />
			SCC 471 Sevaka Perumal, etc. v. State of Tamil Nadu)]
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii) The opportunity under Section 235(2) is not confined
			<lb />
			merely to hearing oral submissions. It is also intended to
			<lb />
			give an opportunity to the prosecution as well as the convict
			<lb />
			to bring facts and material relating to his circumstances as
			<lb />
			well as various factors bearing on the question of sentence
			<lb />
			on record. If such material and factors are contested by
			<lb />
			either side, then they are entitled to produce evidence for the
			<lb />
			purposes of establishing the same. (Ref. : (1976) 4 SCC 190,
			<lb />
			Santa Singh v. State of Punjab)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iv) The relevant material may be placed before the court
			<lb />
			by means of affidavits. If either party disputes the
			<lb />
			correctness or veracity of the material sought to be produced
			<lb />
			by the either side, an opportunity would have to be given to
			<lb />
			the party concerned to lead evidence for the purposes of
			<lb />
			bringing such material on record.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(v) It is for the court to ensure that the hearing on the
			<lb />
			sentence is not abused and turned into an instrument for
			<lb />
			unduly protracting the proceedings. The claim of due and
			<lb />
			proper hearing would have to be harmonised with the
			<lb />
			requirement of expeditious disposal of the proceedings.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(vi) Once the court after giving opportunity, proposes to
			<lb />
			impose an appropriate sentence, there is no need to adjourn
			<lb />
			the case any further.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ix) Some illustrative aspects of what could be guiding
			<lb />
			factors for sentencing purposes, include nature of culpability,
			<lb />
			the antecedents of the accused, the factum of age, the
			<lb />
			potentiality of the convict to become a criminal in future,
			<lb />
			possibility of his reformation and to lead an acceptable life
			<lb />
			in the prevalent milieu, the propensity to become a social
			<lb />
			threat or nuisance, and sometimes lapse of time in the
			<lb />
			commission of the crime and his conduct in the interregnum
			<lb />
			bearing in mind the nature of the offence, the relationship
			<lb />
			between the parties and attractability of the doctrine of
			<lb />
			bringing the convict to the value-based social mainstream.
			<lb />
			[Ref. : (2013) 7 SCC 545 Gopal Singh vs. State of
			<lb />
			Uttarakhand (para 18)].
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(x) Certain additional factors which have to be taken into
			<lb />
			account include the nature of the offence, the circumstances-
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-extenuating or aggravating-of the offence, the prior criminal
			<lb />
			record, if any, of the offender, the age of the offender, the
			<lb />
			record of the offender as to employment, the background of
			<lb />
			the offender with reference to education, home life, society
			<lb />
			and social adjustment, the emotional and mental condition of
			<lb />
			the offender, the prospects for the rehabilitation of the
			<lb />
			offender, the possibility of return of the offender to a normal
			<lb />
			life in the community, the possibility of treatment or training
			<lb />
			of the offender, the possibility that the sentence may serve as
			<lb />
			a deterrent to crime by the offender or by others and the
			<lb />
			current community need, if any, for such a deterrent in
			<lb />
			respect to the particular type of offence. [Ref.: (1976) 4 SCC
			<lb />
			190, Santa Singh v. The State of Punjab (para 3)]
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(xi) The relevant information for sentencing hearing would
			<lb />
			include the aspects relating to nature, motive and impact of
			<lb />
			crime, culpability of convict, etc. The quality of evidence
			<lb />
			adduced is also relevant. [Ref.: (2009) 6 SCC 498, Santosh
			<lb />
			Kumar Satish Bhushan Bariyar v. State of Maharashtra]
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(xii) In case the trial court has failed to adjourn the case to
			<lb />
			comport to the requirements of Section 235(2), the appellate
			<lb />
			court may grant such opportunity.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(xiii) If imposing the death penalty, the court must return a
			<lb />
			finding that the convict is incapable of reformation and
			<lb />
			rehabilitation and record &apos;special reasons&apos; for imposing the
			<lb />
			extreme penalty.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(xiv) The failure of the trial court to record ‗special reasons&apos;
			<lb />
			in terms of Section 354(3) of the Cr.P.C. must not
			<lb />
			necessarily entail remand to that court for elaboration upon
			<lb />
			its conclusions in awarding the death sentence. If no such
			<lb />
			material had been placed during the trial, the same can be
			<lb />
			placed in the reference proceedings before the High Court.
			<lb />
			In case, the State fails to produce any material, the court
			<lb />
			could ascertain from the material on record, if there are any
			<lb />
			mitigating factors favouring the accused, for instance, the
			<lb />
			nominal roll with regard to overall conduct in jail. [Ref.:
			<lb />
			Death Sentence Ref.5/2012, State v. Om Prakash, decided
			<lb />
			on 17 th April, 2014 by the Division Bench of this court]
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(xv) While weighing circumstances for imposing an
			<lb />
			adequate sentence, the court has to perform this duty with
			<lb />
			&quot;due reverence for Rule of Law; the collective conscience on
			<lb />
			the one hand and the doctrine of proportionality, principle of
			<lb />
			reformation and other concomitant factors on the other. The
			<lb />
			task may be onerous but the same has to be done with total
			<lb />
			empirical rationality sans any kind of personal philosophy
			<lb />
			or individual experience or any a-priori notion.‖ [Ref. :
			<lb />
			(2013) 7 SCC 545 Gopal Singh vs. State of Uttarakhand
			<lb />
			(para 19)]
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			291. In addition to the above, we would like to reiterate the points
			<lb />
			emphasised by the Division Bench of this court in the decision
			<lb />
			dated 17 th April, 2014 in Death Ref.No.1/2013, State v. Bharat
			<lb />
			Singh in the decision authored by our learned brother, Dr. S.
			<lb />
			Muralidhar, J. Adding our suggestions to these points, it is directed
			<lb />
			that the trial courts deliberating on the question of sentence to be
			<lb />
			awarded to a convict for commission of an offence which is
			<lb />
			punishable with the death penalty, after pronouncing the judgment
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Concerns for the victims -award of compensation to heal
			<lb />
			and as a method of reconciling victim to the offender
			<lb />
			The discussion on this subject is being considered under the
			<lb />
			following sub-headings:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Compensation is in addition to the sentence imposed upon
			<lb />
			the convict, not ancillary to it.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) Powers of the appellate court to pass compensation orders.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii) Persons entitled to compensation.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iv) &quot;Fine&quot; and &quot;compensation&quot; -distinction, if any.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(v) Procedure to be followed and principles for fixation of fine
			<lb />
			and compensation.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(vi) Can a compensation order impact the severity of the
			<lb />
			sentence imposed?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(vii) Quantification of compensation.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(viii) Public law remedies for established violations of
			<lb />
			constitutional rights and principles for determining
			<lb />
			compensation.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			292. In (1981) 1 SCC 107, Maru Ram v. Union of India, Krishna
			<lb />
			Iyer, J. declared that while &quot;social responsibility of the criminal to
			<lb />
			restore the loss or heal the injury is part of the punitive exercise
			<lb />
			but the length of the prison term is no reparation to the crippled or
			<lb />
			bereaved but is futility compounded with cruelty. Victimology...
			<lb />
			must find fulfilment, not through barbarity but by compulsory
			<lb />
			recoupment by the wrongdoer of the damage inflicted not by giving
			<lb />
			more pain to the offender, but by lessening the loss of the forlorn&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			293. It is necessary to understand the spirit, object and intendment
			<lb />
			of the award of compensation under the Cr.P.C. Section 545 of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. (Act 5 of 1858) corresponds to the current Section 357 of
			<lb />
			the Cr.P.C. Section 545 was amended by Act 18 of 1923 and Act
			<lb />
			26 of 1955. The legislative intent was noted by the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			in its judgment reported at (1978) 4 SCC 111, Sarwan Singh &amp;
			<lb />
			Ors. v. State of Punjab when it extracted the following statement
			<lb />
			of the Joint Select Committee:
			<lb />
			-10. The law which enables the Court to direct
			<lb />
			compensation to be paid to the dependants is found in
			<lb />
			Section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
			<lb />
			(Act 2 of 1974). The corresponding provision in the 1898
			<lb />
			Code was Section 545. Section 545 of Code of Criminal
			<lb />
			Procedure, 1898 (Act 5 of 1898) was amended by Act 18
			<lb />
			of 1923 and by Act 26 of 1955. The amendment which is
			<lb />
			relevant for the purpose of our discussion is 545(1)(bb)
			<lb />
			which, for the first time inserted by Act 26 of 1955. By
			<lb />
			this amendment the court is enabled to direct the accused,
			<lb />
			who caused the death of another person, to pay
			<lb />
			compensation to the persons who are, under the Fatal
			<lb />
			Accidents Act, entitled to recover damages from the
			<lb />
			persons sentenced, for the loss resulting to them from
			<lb />
			such death. In introducing the amendment, the Joint
			<lb />
			Select Committee stated -when death has been caused
			<lb />
			to a person, it is but proper that his heirs and
			<lb />
			dependants should be compensated, in suitable cases,
			<lb />
			for the loss resulting to them from such death, by the
			<lb />
			person who was responsible for it. The Committee
			<lb />
			proceeded to state that though Section 545 of the Code as
			<lb />
			amended in 1923 was intended to cover such cases, the
			<lb />
			intention was not however very clearly brought out and
			<lb />
			therefore in order to focus the attention of the courts on
			<lb />
			this aspect of the question, the Committee have amended
			<lb />
			Section 545 and it has been made clear that a fine may
			<lb />
			form a part of any sentence including a sentence of
			<lb />
			death and it has also been provided that the persons who
			<lb />
			are entitled under the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855, to
			<lb />
			recover damages from the person sentenced may be
			<lb />
			compensated out of the fine imposed. It also expressed its
			<lb />
			full agreement with the suggestion that at the time of
			<lb />
			awarding judgment in a case where death has resulted
			<lb />
			from homicide, the court should award compensation to
			<lb />
			the heirs of the deceased. The Committee felt that this
			<lb />
			will result in settling the claim once for all by doing away
			<lb />
			with the need for a further claim in a civil court, and
			<lb />
			avoid needless worry and expense to both sides. The
			<lb />
			Committee further agreed that in cases where the death is
			<lb />
			the result of negligence of the offender, appropriate
			<lb />
			compensation should be awarded to the heirs. By the
			<lb />
			introduction of clause (bb) to Section 545(1), the
			<lb />
			intention of the legislature was made clear that, in
			<lb />
			suitable cases, the heirs and dependants should be
			<lb />
			compensated for the loss that resulted to them from the
			<lb />
			death, from a person who was responsible for it. The
			<lb />
			view was also expressed that the court should award
			<lb />
			compensation to the heir of the deceased so that their
			<lb />
			claims would be settled finally. This object is sought to
			<lb />
			be given effect to by Section 357 of the new Code (Act 2
			<lb />
			of 1974). xxx

		<p>
			294. Section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is therefore,
			<lb />
			concerned with the powers of the trial court as well as the appellate
			<lb />
			court to order payment of compensation to victims as well as
			<lb />
			persons who suffered because of the crime. Before proceeding any
			<lb />
			further, we may firstly set out the provisions of Section 357 of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. which read thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;357. Order to pay compensation. -(1) When a Court
			<lb />
			imposes a sentence of fine or a sentence (including a
			<lb />
			sentence of death) of which fine forms a part, the Court
			<lb />
			may, when passing judgment, order the whole or any
			<lb />
			part of the fine recovered to be applied -
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(a) in defraying the expenses properly incurred in the
			<lb />
			prosecution;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(b) in the payment to any person of compensation for any
			<lb />
			loss or injury caused by the offence, when compensation
			<lb />
			is, in the opinion of the Court, recoverable by such
			<lb />
			person in a Civil Court;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(c) when any person is convicted of any offence for
			<lb />
			having caused the death of another person or of having
			<lb />
			abetted the commission of such an offence, in paying
			<lb />
			compensation to the persons who are, under the
			<lb />
			Fatal Accidents Act, 1855 (13 of 1855 ), entitled to
			<lb />
			recover damages from the person sentenced for the loss
			<lb />
			resulting to them from such death;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(d) when any person is convicted of any offence which
			<lb />
			includes theft, criminal misappropriation, criminal breach
			<lb />
			of trust, or cheating, or of having dishonestly received or
			<lb />
			retained, or of having voluntarily assisted in disposing of,
			<lb />
			stolen property knowing or having reason to believe the
			<lb />
			same to be stolen, in compensating any bona fide
			<lb />
			purchaser of such property for the loss of the same if
			<lb />
			such property is restored to the possession of the person
			<lb />
			entitled thereto.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2) If the fine is imposed in a case which is subject to
			<lb />
			appeal, no such payment shall be made before the period
			<lb />
			allowed for presenting the appeal has elapsed, or, if an
			<lb />
			appeal be presented, before the decision of the appeal.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(3) When a Court imposes a sentence, of which fine does
			<lb />
			not form a part, the Court may, when passing judgment,
			<lb />
			order the accused person to pay, by way of
			<lb />
			compensation, such amount as may be specified in the
			<lb />
			order to the person who has suffered any loss or injury by
			<lb />
			reason of the act for which the accused person has been
			<lb />
			so sentenced.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(4) An order under this section may also be made by an
			<lb />
			Appellate Court or by the High Court or Court of Session
			<lb />
			when exercising its powers of revision.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(5) At the time of awarding compensation in any
			<lb />
			subsequent civil suit relating to the same matter, the
			<lb />
			Court shall take into account any sum paid or recovered
			<lb />
			as compensation under this section.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Underlining by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			295. Apart from Section 357 of the Cr.P.C., the power to grant
			<lb />
			compensation is specifically conferred in inter alia the following
			<lb />
			statutory provisions:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Under Section 5 of the Probation of Offenders Act, the court
			<lb />
			is empowered to require a release of offender to pay compensation
			<lb />
			and cost.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(ii) Section 22 of the Protection of Women from Domestic
			<lb />
			Violence Act, 2005 enables the Magistrate, in addition to other
			<lb />
			reliefs that may be granted under this Act, on an application by the
			<lb />
			aggrieved person, to pass an order directing the respondent to pay
			<lb />
			compensation and damages for the injuries, including mental
			<lb />
			torture and emotional distress, caused by the acts of domestic
			<lb />
			violence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii) In the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of
			<lb />
			Atrocities) Act, 1989, a scale is given in the schedule annexed as
			<lb />
			Annexure &apos;1&apos; to Rule 12 for providing minimum relief in cash or
			<lb />
			kind or both to victims of atrocities, their families or dependants.
			<lb />
			In case of murder or death of a non-earning member of the family,
			<lb />
			a minimum amount of relief is specified at Rs.2,50,000/-while in
			<lb />
			the case of an earning member of the family, the minimum amount
			<lb />
			is stated at Rs.5,00,000/-.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			296. It is apparent from the above that Section 357 of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. envisages two contingencies, the first being when the court
			<lb />
			imposes a sentence of fine or a sentence (including a sentence of
			<lb />
			death) of which fine forms a part. In such eventuality, under Sub-
			<lb />
			Section (1), the court stands empowered to, when passing
			<lb />
			judgment, order that the whole or any part of the recovered fine to
			<lb />
			be utilized in the manner set down in Sub-Section (1). The
			<lb />
			legislation contemplates a second contingency, that is, when a
			<lb />
			sentence is imposed on the person of which fine does not form
			<lb />
			a part. This is provided for under Sub-Section (3) of Section 357 of
			<lb />
			the Cr.P.C. Sub-Section (3) of Section 357 empowers the court
			<lb />
			when passing the judgment to order the accused person to pay a
			<lb />
			specific amount by way of compensation to the person who has
			<lb />
			suffered any loss by reason of the act for which the accused person
			<lb />
			has been so sentenced.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			297. The statutory intent is obviously to compel the convict to
			<lb />
			compensate the victim for the consequences resulting from such
			<lb />
			offence which, could be of tremendous deprivation especially in a
			<lb />
			case where either life is lost or impaired or where a person has
			<lb />
			been disabled subjected to or violence.

			<lb />
			pg. 239
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			298. The following inherent limitations in Section 357 have been
			<lb />
			noted by the Supreme Court in para 21 of (2014) SCC Online SC
			<lb />
			952, Suresh &amp; Anr. v. State of Haryana:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;(i) Section 357 can be invoked only upon conviction,
			<lb />
			that too at the discretion of the judge and subject to
			<lb />
			financial capacity to pay by the accused.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) The long time taken in disposal of the criminal
			<lb />
			case whereas victims need immediate relief and cannot
			<lb />
			wait for conviction which could be time consuming.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii) Compensation depends upon financial capacity of
			<lb />
			the accused to compensate for which evidence is rarely
			<lb />
			collected.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iv) Victims are unable to make a representation for
			<lb />
			compensation for want of legal aid or otherwise.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(v) Conviction rates being low, Section 357 is hardly
			<lb />
			adequate to address the needs of the victims.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			299. Expressing concerns for the victims of crime, in the
			<lb />
			judgment reported at (1998) 7 SCC 392, State of Gujarat v.
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble High Court of Gujarat, the Supreme Court suggested that
			<lb />
			the State should make a law for setting apart a portion of wages
			<lb />
			earned by prisoners to be paid as compensation to deserving
			<lb />
			victims of the offence, the commission of which entailed a
			<lb />
			sentence of imprisonment to the prisoner, either directly or through
			<lb />
			a common fund to be created for this purpose or in another feasible
			<lb />
			mode. The entitlement of reparation, restitution and safeguard of
			<lb />
			the rights of the victim was noted. It was pointed out that if justice
			<lb />
			was not done to the victim of the crime, criminal justice would
			<lb />
			look hollow. Reiterating that a life which is lost or snuffed out
			<lb />
			could not be recompensed, that monetary compensation would at
			<lb />
			least provide some solace, the Supreme Court observed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-46. One area which is totally overlooked in the above
			<lb />
			practice is the plight of the victims. It is a recent trend in
			<lb />
			the sentencing policy to listen to the wailings of the
			<lb />
			victims. Rehabilitation of the prisoner need not be by
			<lb />
			closing the eyes towards the suffering victims of the
			<lb />
			offence. A glimpse at the field of victimology reveals
			<lb />
			two types of victims. The first type consists of direct
			<lb />
			victims, i.e., those who are alive and suffering on
			<lb />
			account of the harm inflicted by the prisoner while
			<lb />
			committing the crime. The second type comprises of
			<lb />
			indirect victims who are dependants of the direct victims
			<lb />
			of crimes who undergo sufferings due to deprivation of
			<lb />
			their breadwinner.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />

			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			&quot;99. In our efforts to look after and protect the human
			<lb />
			rights of the convict, we cannot forget the victim or his
			<lb />
			family in case of his death or who is otherwise
			<lb />
			incapacitated to earn his livelihood because of the
			<lb />
			criminal act of the convict. The victim is certainly
			<lb />
			entitled to reparation, restitution and safeguard of his
			<lb />
			rights. Criminal justice would look hollow if justice is
			<lb />
			not done to the victim of the crime. The subject of
			<lb />
			victimology is gaining ground while we are also
			<lb />
			concerned with the rights of the prisoners and prison
			<lb />
			reforms. A victim of crime cannot be a -forgotten man‖
			<lb />
			in the criminal justice system. It is he who has suffered
			<lb />
			the most. His family is ruined particularly in case of
			<lb />
			death and other bodily injury. This is apart from the
			<lb />
			factors like loss of reputation, humiliation, etc. An
			<lb />
			honour which is lost or life which is snuffed out cannot
			<lb />
			be recompensed but then monetary compensation will
			<lb />
			at least provide some solace.

			101. Reparation is taken to mean the making of amends
			<lb />
			by an offender to his victim, or to victims of crime
			<lb />
			generally, and may take the form of compensation, the
			<lb />
			performance of some service or the return of stolen
			<lb />
			property (restitution), these being types of reparation
			<lb />
			which might be described as practical or material. The
			<lb />
			term can also be used to describe more intangible
			<lb />
			outcomes, as where an offender makes an apology to a
			<lb />
			victim and provides some reassurance that the offence
			<lb />
			will not be repeated, thus repairing the psychological
			<lb />
			harm suffered by the victim as a result of the crime.

			300. We may usefuly also refer to a pronouncement of the High
			<lb />
			Court of Madhya Pradesh reported at 2007 (2) JabLJ 207,
			<lb />
			Subhash Yadav v. State of M.P. wherein the concerns of the
			<lb />
			victim in order to do complete justice have been articulated in the
			<lb />
			following terms:
			<lb />
			-10. …In the name of free and speed delivery of justice, the
			<lb />
			agony and anguish of the victim cannot be kept at bay. It
			<lb />
			cannot be conceived that in the adjudicatory system of
			<lb />
			criminal trial, the victim is to be forgotten or kept in the
			<lb />
			oblivion. A crime in essence mostly always is against the
			<lb />
			collective and the cry of the collective cannot be
			<lb />
			marginalized. Not for nothing it had been said when the cry
			<lb />
			of the collective is curbed or marred, one sees cracks in the
			<lb />
			City Halls. The justness of justice has to be jealously
			<lb />
			guarded by the protectors of law. She cannot be allowed to
			<lb />
			suffer the ignominy at any cost. Beacon light of justice has
			<lb />
			to illuminate the society. The laser beam has to remove the
			<lb />
			concavities, for ‗law is the safest helmet&apos; -to borrow the
			<lb />
			phrase from Sir Edward Coke.‖

			301. In the present cases, this court is considering the adequacy
			<lb />
			of the sentences imposed by the trial courts as against the prayers
			<lb />
			for their enhancement by the State and complainant. Some fines
			<lb />
			stand imposed against the defendants. The question is as whether
			<lb />
			the fine is adequate. In addition, the trial courts have also not made
			<lb />
			any orders for disbursements. No order of compensation has been
			<lb />
			made in terms of Section 357 of the Cr.P.C. What would be the
			<lb />
			options available to this court while considering the appropriate
			<lb />
			order to be passed? Is it open to this court in appeal revision to
			<lb />
			enhance the fine and make appropriate order for its disbursement
			<lb />
			under Section 357 (1) of the Cr.P.C.? Or would it be permissible
			<lb />
			and more appropriate to substitute the fine imposed under
			<lb />
			Section 357(1) of the Cr.P.C. with an appropriate order of
			<lb />
			reasonable and just compensation under Section 357 (3) of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C.?
			<lb />
			Would the second option require recalling the order of
			<lb />
			sentences to the extent that it imposes a fine and, after making the
			<lb />
			summary inquiry postulated by law, to award reasonable and
			<lb />
			fair compensation in accordance with law. We propose to consider
			<lb />
			these questions, related aspects and options available to the courts
			<lb />
			hereafter.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Compensation is in addition to the sentence imposed upon
			<lb />
			the convict, not ancillary to it
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			302. What is the order to be passed upon conviction of the
			<lb />
			accused? Section 53 of the Indian Penal Code provides for the
			<lb />
			hierarchy of sentences which may be imposed. These range from
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 243
			<lb />
			fine, forfeiture of property, imprisonment (rigorous and simple) for
			<lb />
			varying periods going upto life and the ultimate punishment of
			<lb />
			imposition of death penalty. The scheme of Section 357 of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. clearly shows that the payment of compensation is
			<lb />
			irrespective of imposition of even the death penalty or a sentence
			<lb />
			of imprisonment or imposition of a fine upon conviction. This is
			<lb />
			apparent from the scheme of the statute which permits a court
			<lb />
			imposing a fine to direct that a portion thereof may be paid towards
			<lb />
			compensation. Sub-Section 3 takes into its fold, payment of
			<lb />
			compensation in a case where the sentence of fine is not imposed
			<lb />
			upon the convict.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			303. The Supreme Court has repeatedly criticised the courts for
			<lb />
			not exercising jurisdiction under Section 357 of the Cr.P.C. In
			<lb />
			(1979) 4 SCC 719, Rattan Singh v. State of Punjab, it was held
			<lb />
			that the courts should be liberal while using Section 357 of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			304. In the judgment reported at (1988) 4 SCC 551, Hari Singh
			<lb />
			v. Sukhbir Singh, the Supreme Court has again reminded that the
			<lb />
			provisions of Section 357 of the Cr.P.C. to award compensation to
			<lb />
			the victim should be liberally used to meet the ends of justice as a
			<lb />
			measure of responding appropriately to the crime and reconciling
			<lb />
			the victim with the offender observing as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;10. ...Sub-section (1) of Section 357 provides power to
			<lb />
			award compensation to victims of the offence out of the
			<lb />
			sentence of fine imposed on accused. ...It is an important
			<lb />
			provision but courts have seldom invoked it. Perhaps due
			<lb />
			to ignorance of the object of it. It empowers the court to
			<lb />
			award compensation to victims while passing judgment
			<lb />
			of conviction. In addition to conviction, the court may
			<lb />
			order the accused to pay some amount by way of
			<lb />
			compensation to victim who has suffered by the action
			<lb />
			of accused. It may be noted that this power of courts to
			<lb />
			award compensation is not ancillary to other sentences
			<lb />
			but it is in addition thereto. This power was intended to
			<lb />
			do something to reassure the victim that he or she is not
			<lb />
			forgotten in the criminal justice system. It is a measure
			<lb />
			of responding appropriately to crime as well of
			<lb />
			reconciling the victim with the offender. It is, to some
			<lb />
			extent, a constructive approach to crimes. It is indeed a
			<lb />
			step forward in our criminal justice system. We,
			<lb />
			therefore, recommend to all courts to exercise this power
			<lb />
			liberally so as to meet the ends of justice in a better
			<lb />
			way.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			305. The Supreme Court had occasion to consider an appeal
			<lb />
			wherein the appellant had not only murdered his own mother but
			<lb />
			his elder brother, nephew and niece and their friends leaving
			<lb />
			behind only his brother&apos;s wife in the judgment reported at (1994) 4
			<lb />
			SCC 29, Balraj v. State of U.P. It was noted that the deceased
			<lb />
			brother&apos;s widow was left without any support for maintenance and
			<lb />
			was without any family. The court was of the view that it was a fit
			<lb />
			case where the court should award compensation to her. So far as
			<lb />
			the power of the court to award compensation is concerned, the
			<lb />
			court observed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-11. xxx xxx xxx Section 357(3) CrPC provides for
			<lb />
			ordering of payment by way of compensation to the
			<lb />
			victim by the accused. It is an important provision and it
			<lb />
			must also be noted that power to award compensation is
			<lb />
			not ancillary to other sentences but it is in addition
			<lb />
			thereto. To the same effect are the decisions of this Court
			<lb />
			in Sarwan Singh v. State of Punjab [(1978) 4 SCC 111 :
			<lb />
			1978 SCC (Cri) 549 : AIR 1978 SC 1525] and Hari
			<lb />
			Singh v. Sukhbir Singh[(1988) 4 SCC 551 : 1988 SCC
			<lb />
			(Cri) 984] . In the instant case the records show that the
			<lb />
			appellant Balraj has property and also some means.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			306. This was reiterated by the Supreme Court in para 44 of
			<lb />
			the judgment reported at (2007) 6 SCC 528, Dilip S.
			<lb />
			Dahanukar v. Kotak Mahindra Co.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			307. Again in (2010) 6 SCC 230, K.A Abbas H.S.A. v. Sabu
			<lb />
			Joseph, the Supreme Court reminded courts of the importance of
			<lb />
			Section 357 of the Cr.P.C. in the following terms:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;18. In this case, we are not concerned with sub-section
			<lb />
			(1). We are concerned only with sub-section (3). It is an
			<lb />
			important provision but the courts have seldom invoked
			<lb />
			it. Perhaps due to ignorance of the object of it. It
			<lb />
			empowers the court to award compensation to victims
			<lb />
			while passing judgment of conviction. In addition to
			<lb />
			conviction, the court may order the accused to pay some
			<lb />
			amount by way of compensation to the victim who has
			<lb />
			suffered by the action of the accused. It may be noted
			<lb />
			that this power of the courts to award compensation is
			<lb />
			not ancillary to other sentences but it is in addition
			<lb />
			thereto. This power was intended to do something to
			<lb />
			reassure the victim that he or she is not forgotten in
			<lb />
			the criminal justice system. It is a measure of
			<lb />
			responding appropriately to crime as well as of
			<lb />
			reconciling the victim with the offender. It is, to some
			<lb />
			extent, a constructive approach to crimes. It is indeed a
			<lb />
			step forward in our criminal justice system. We,
			<lb />
			therefore, recommend to all the courts to exercise this
			<lb />
			power liberally so as to meet the ends of justice in a
			<lb />
			better way.&quot;

			308. In para 66 of the pronouncement at (2013) 6 SCC 770
			<lb />
			Ankush Shivaji Gaikwad v. State of Maharashtra, reference is
			<lb />
			made to the ‗question of sentence and compensation&quot;. It is
			<lb />
			therefore trite that compensation is in addition to the sentence
			<lb />
			which may be imposed upon the convict and that the consideration
			<lb />
			of compensation is at the post conviction stage, when the court is
			<lb />
			considering the question as to imposition of an adequate and proper
			<lb />
			sentence on the accused.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii) Powers of the appellate court to pass compensation orders
			<lb />
			309. We are herein considering this issue at the appellate stage.
			<lb />
			Is it permissible for the appellate court to pass an order against the
			<lb />
			defendants for payment of compensation. Sub-section 4 of Section
			<lb />
			357 unequivocally declares that an order for compensation may be
			<lb />
			made by the appellate court or by the High Court or Session Court
			<lb />
			in exercise of its power of revision.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			310. In para 12 of (2008) 8 SCC 225, Manish Jalan v. State of
			<lb />
			Karnataka, the court reiterated that the power vested in the
			<lb />
			appellate court or the High Court or the Court of Session
			<lb />
			(Revision) to award compensation under sub-section 3 of Section
			<lb />
			357 Cr.P.C. is wide and is in addition to any other sentence which
			<lb />
			may be awarded on conviction of a person. It was further stated in
			<lb />
			para 11 that compensation was not a substitute for a sentence on
			<lb />
			conviction. The court also lamented the fact that courts have not
			<lb />
			directed compensation despite the power to do so observing thus:
			<lb />
			pg. 247
			<lb />
			&quot;12. Though a comprehensive provision enabling the
			<lb />
			court to direct payment of compensation has been in
			<lb />
			existence all through but the experience has shown that
			<lb />
			the provision has rarely attracted the attention of the
			<lb />
			courts. Time and again the courts have been
			<lb />
			reminded that the provision is aimed at serving the social
			<lb />
			purpose and should be exercised liberally yet the results
			<lb />
			are not very heartening.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			311. In the judgment reported at (2012) 3 SCC 221, Roy
			<lb />
			Fernandes v. State of Goa, the court observed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;41. The provision of payment of compensation has been
			<lb />
			in existence for a considerable period of time on the
			<lb />
			statute book in this country. Even so, the criminal Courts
			<lb />
			have not, it appears, taken significant note of the said
			<lb />
			provision or exercised the power vested in them
			<lb />
			thereunder. ...&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			312. The Registry has circulated the judgment reported at (2013)
			<lb />
			6 SCC 770, Ankush Shivaji Gaikwad v. State of Maharashtra. In
			<lb />
			this matter, the prosecution case is that the deceased and his wife
			<lb />
			were guarding their sugarcane crop in their field, when their dog
			<lb />
			started barking at the appellant and his two companions. The
			<lb />
			barking of the dog provoked the appellant into beating the dog with
			<lb />
			a rod. The deceased took objection to the beating of the dog, least
			<lb />
			anticipating that the same would escalate into a serious fight in the
			<lb />
			heat of the moment. The exchange of hot words culminated in hte
			<lb />
			deceased being hit with the rod, unfortunately on a vital part like
			<lb />
			the head, and died. The appellant was convicted for commission of
			<lb />
			an offence under Section 302 IPC. The expression of anguish by
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court in this judgment regard to the failure of the
			<lb />
			courts to pass orders for payment of compensation and to abide by
			<lb />
			the mandate of Section 357 of the Cr.P.C., despite the plethora of
			<lb />
			prior judicial precedents, deserves to be extracted in extenso and
			<lb />
			reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;28. The only other aspect that needs to be examined is
			<lb />
			whether any compensation be awarded against the
			<lb />
			appellant and in favour of the bereaved family under
			<lb />
			Section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
			<lb />
			This aspect arises very often and has been a subject-
			<lb />
			matter of several pronouncements of this Court. The
			<lb />
			same may require some elaboration to place in bold
			<lb />
			relief certain aspects that need to be addressed by the
			<lb />
			courts but have despite the decisions of this
			<lb />
			Court remained obscure and neglected by the courts at
			<lb />
			different levels in this country.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			48. The question then is whether the plenitude of the
			<lb />
			power vested in the courts under Sections 357 and 357-
			<lb />
			A, notwithstanding, the courts can simply ignore the
			<lb />
			provisions or neglect the exercise of a power that
			<lb />
			is primarily meant to be exercised for the benefit of the
			<lb />
			victims of crimes that are so often committed though less
			<lb />
			frequently punished by the courts. In other words,
			<lb />
			whether courts have a duty to advert to the question of
			<lb />
			awarding compensation to the victim and record
			<lb />
			reasons while granting or refusing relief to them?‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			313. The Supreme Court discussed the entire gamut of case law
			<lb />
			on the subject emphasising the -mandatory duty‖ of the courts to
			<lb />
			consider the question of awarding -compensation‖ in -every
			<lb />
			criminal case‖ as follows:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-54. Applying the tests which emerge from the above
			<lb />
			cases to Section 357, it appears to us that the provision
			<lb />
			confers a power coupled with a duty on the courts to
			<lb />
			apply its mind to the question of awarding
			<lb />
			compensation in every criminal case. We say so because
			<lb />
			in the background and context in which it was
			<lb />
			introduced, the power to award compensation was
			<lb />
			intended to reassure the victim that he or she is not
			<lb />
			forgotten in the criminal justice system. The victim
			<lb />
			would remain forgotten in the criminal justice system if
			<lb />
			despite the legislature having gone so far as to enact
			<lb />
			specific provisions relating to victim compensation,
			<lb />
			courts choose to ignore the provisions altogether and do
			<lb />
			not even apply their mind to the question
			<lb />
			of compensation. It follows that unless Section 357 is
			<lb />
			read to confer an obligation on the courts to apply their
			<lb />
			mind to the question of compensation, it would defeat
			<lb />
			the very object behind the introduction of the provision.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			61. Section 357 CrPC confers a duty on the court to
			<lb />
			apply its mind to the question of compensation in every
			<lb />
			criminal case. It necessarily follows that the court must
			<lb />
			disclose that it has applied its mind to this question in
			<lb />
			every criminal case.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			66.To sum up: while the award or refusal of
			<lb />
			compensation in a particular case may be within the
			<lb />
			court&apos;s discretion, there exists a mandatory duty on the
			<lb />
			court to apply its mind to the question in every criminal
			<lb />
			case. xxx&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			314. After a detailed discussion of the facts of the case, finally in
			<lb />
			para 67, the court noted that both the trial court as well as the High
			<lb />
			Court had remained -ignorant‖ (-oblivious‖) of the provisions of
			<lb />
			Section 357. However, given the time lag since the offence was
			<lb />
			committed, the Supreme Court did not consider remand of the case
			<lb />
			for the purpose to be a good option.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 250
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			315. In the judgment reported at (1982) 1 SC 608, Girdhari Lal v.
			<lb />
			State of Punjab, it has been held that when there is no sentence of
			<lb />
			fine or where the convict has been let off on probation, there can be
			<lb />
			no direction under Section 357(1)(a).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			316. There is therefore not only statutory empowerment under
			<lb />
			Section 357(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the appellate
			<lb />
			court to make an appropriate order regarding compensation but the
			<lb />
			mandatory duty of every court, at the trial stage as well as the
			<lb />
			appellate court to consider and pass an order of fair and reasonable
			<lb />
			compensation on relevant factors.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii) Persons entitled to compensation
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			317. A bare reading of Section 357 of the Cr.P.C. makes evident
			<lb />
			the farsightedness of the legislature in including the &apos;costs incurred
			<lb />
			in prosecution&apos; (Section 357 (1a)); ‗any person&apos; who has suffered
			<lb />
			loss or injury by the offence (Section 357(1b)); ‗persons&quot; who are
			<lb />
			entitled, under the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855 to recover damages
			<lb />
			from the person sentenced (Section 357(1c)); a ‗bonafide
			<lb />
			purchaser&apos; of property involved in an offence (Section 357(1d)),
			<lb />
			as entitled to compensation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			318. We may usefully make a reference also to the United
			<lb />
			Nations Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of
			<lb />
			Crime and Abuse of Power (United Nation General Assembly,
			<lb />
			1985) which describes &apos;victims&apos; as including the following:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;1. &quot;Victims&quot; means persons who, individually or
			<lb />
			collectively, have suffered harm, including physical or
			<lb />
			mental injury, emotional suffering, economic loss or
			<lb />
			substantial impairment of their fundamental rights,
			<lb />
			through acts or omissions that are in violation of
			<lb />
			criminal laws operative within Member States, including
			<lb />
			those laws proscribing criminal abuse of power.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			2.
			<lb />
			A person may be considered a victim, under this
			<lb />
			Declaration, regardless of whether the perpetrator is
			<lb />
			identified, apprehended, prosecuted or convicted and
			<lb />
			regardless of the familial relationship between the
			<lb />
			perpetrator and the victim. The term &apos;victim&apos; also
			<lb />
			includes, where appropriate, the immediate family or
			<lb />
			dependents of the direct victim and persons who have
			<lb />
			suffered harm in intervening to assist victims in distress
			<lb />
			or to prevent victimization.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			319. So far as the descriptions of persons entitled to
			<lb />
			compensation are concerned, the Justice Malimath Committee on
			<lb />
			Reforms of the Criminal Justice System (March, 2003) (appointed
			<lb />
			by the Government of India) has made the following
			<lb />
			recommendations:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;i) The victim, and if he is dead, his legal representative
			<lb />
			shall have the right to be impleaded as a party in every
			<lb />
			criminal proceeding where the charge is punishable with 7
			<lb />
			years imprisonment or more.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			ii) In select cases notified by the appropriate government,
			<lb />
			with the permission of the court an approved voluntary
			<lb />
			organization shall also have the right to implead in court
			<lb />
			proceedings.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			iii) The victim has a right to be represented by an advocate
			<lb />
			of his choice;
			<lb />
			provided that an advocate shall be provided at the cost of the
			<lb />
			State if the victim is not in a position to afford a lawyer.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			iv) The victim&apos;s right to participate in criminal trial shall,
			<lb />
			inter alia, include:
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg.
		</p>
		<p>
			252
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			a) To produce evidence, oral or documentary, with leave of
			<lb />
			the Court and/or to seek directions for production of such
			<lb />
			evidence
			<lb />
			b) To ask questions to the witnesses or to suggest to the
			<lb />
			court questions which may be put to witnesses
			<lb />
			c) To know the status of investigation and to move the court
			<lb />
			to issue directions for further to the investigation on certain
			<lb />
			matters or to a supervisory officer to ensure effective and
			<lb />
			proper investigation to assist in the search for truth.
			<lb />
			d) To be heard in respect of the grant or cancellation of bail
			<lb />
			e) To be heard whenever prosecution seeks to withdraw and
			<lb />
			to offer to continue the prosecution
			<lb />
			f) To advance arguments after the prosecutor has submitted
			<lb />
			arguments
			<lb />
			g) To participate
		</p>
		<item>
			in negotiations leading to settlement of
			<lb />
			compoundable offences
			<lb />
			v ) The victim shall have a right to prefer an appeal against
			<lb />
			any adverse order passed by the court acquitting the accused,
			<lb />
			convicting for a lesser offence, imposing inadequate
			<lb />
			sentence, or granting inadequate compensation. Such appeal
			<lb />
			shall lie to the court to which an appeal ordinarily lies
			<lb />
			against the order of conviction of such court.
			<lb />
			vi) Legal services to victims in select crimes may be
			<lb />
			extended to include psychiatric and medical help, interim
			<lb />
			compensation
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			protection
			<lb />
			against
			<lb />
			secondary
			<lb />
			victimization.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			vii) Victim compensation is a State obligation in all serious
			<lb />
			crimes, whether the offender is apprehended or not,
			<lb />
			convicted or acquitted. This is to be organised in a separate
			<lb />
			legislation by Parliament. The draft bill on the subject
			<lb />
			submitted to Government in 1995 by the Indian Society of
			<lb />
			Victimology provides a tentative framework for
			<lb />
			consideration.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			viii) The Victim Compensation law will provide for the
			<lb />
			creation of a Victim Compensation Fund to be administered
			<lb />
			possibly by the Legal Services Authority. The law should
			<lb />
			provide for the scale of compensation in different offences
			<lb />
			for the guidance of the Court. It may specify offences in
			<lb />
			which compensation may not be granted and conditions
			<lb />
			under which it may be awarded or withdrawn.&quot;
			<lb />

			<lb />
			resulting in the death of Nitish Katara who at that time was
			<lb />
			succeeded by his ailing father Nishit M. Katara who died on 3rd
			<lb />
			August, 2003, barely a year after the murder; mother Nilam Katara
			<lb />
			and; brother Nitin Katara. The mother of the deceased falls within
			<lb />
			the definition of the expression &apos;legal heir&apos;. However, the father
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Chakraborty (Ms.), the appellant had sought quashing of a
			<lb />
			complaint under Sections 312/420/493/496/498A IPC (filed by the
			<lb />
			respondent, a victim) for developing a sexual relationship with her

			on false assurance of marriage; later going through a semblance of
			<lb />
			a secret marriage after having impregnated her twice; compelled
			<lb />
			her to undergo abortion both times and ultimately deserting her.

			The Supreme Court dismissed the special leave petition and on

			<lb />
			appellant to pay Rs.1,000/-per month interim maintenance to the
			<lb />

			court reiterated its prior declaration that &quot;right to life&quot; does not

			merely mean animal existence but means something more, namely,
			<lb />
			the right to live with human dignity. Right to life would, therefore,
			<lb />
			include all those aspects of life which go to make a life meaningful,
			<lb />
			complete and worth living. We may borrow the following words
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court in para 9 wherein reference is made to the
			<lb />
			plight of women and violation of their fundamental rights:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;9. Unfortunately, a woman, in our country, belongs to a
			<lb />
			class or group of society who are in a disadvantaged
			<lb />
			position on account of several social barriers and
			<lb />
			impediments and have, therefore, been the victim of
			<lb />
			tyranny at the hands of men with whom they, fortunately,
			<lb />
			under the Constitution enjoy equal status. Women also
			<lb />
			have the right to life and liberty; they also have the right
			<lb />
			to be respected and treated as equal citizens. Their
			<lb />
			honour and dignity cannot be touched or violated. They
			<lb />
			also have the right to lead an honourable and peaceful
			<lb />
			life. Women, in them, have many personalities combined.
			<lb />
			They are mother, daughter, sister and wife and not
			<lb />
			playthings for centre spreads in various magazines,
			<lb />
			periodicals or newspapers nor can they be exploited for
			<lb />
			obscene purposes. They must have the liberty, the
			<lb />
			freedom and, of course, independence to live the roles
			<lb />
			assigned to them by Nature so that the society may
			<lb />
			flourish as they alone have the talents and capacity to
			<lb />
			shape the destiny and character of men anywhere and in
			<lb />
			every part of the world.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Underlining by us)
			<lb />
			Violation of these fundamental rights of the respondent
			<lb />
			persuaded the court to pass orders of interim maintenance in her
			<lb />
			favour against the appellant.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			322. In our judgment dated 2 nd April, 2014, we have in paras
			<lb />
			2012 to 2026 discussed that an honour killing on account of
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 255
			<lb />
			objection to woman&apos;s life partner is the gravest violation of a
			<lb />
			fundamental right to life.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			323. We have discussed at length as to how Bharti Yadav is also a
			<lb />
			victim of the honour killing. However, in the circumstance
			<lb />
			brought out during hearings, it appears that she is well settled in
			<lb />
			life now. Whether we award compensation or not in this particular
			<lb />
			case, it needs no further elaboration that the person/partner
			<lb />
			surviving in an honour killing is definitely a victim of the crime
			<lb />
			who would be entitled to compensation under Section 357 of the
			<lb />
			CrPC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			324. The judgment reported at (1978) 4 SCC 111, Sarwan Singh
			<lb />
			&amp; Others v. State of Punjab has noted the recommendation by the
			<lb />
			Joint Select Committee while introducing the amendment of the
			<lb />
			CrPC to incorporate Section 357. The Joint Select Committee had
			<lb />
			recommended that when death has been caused to a person, &quot;his
			<lb />
			heirs and dependants, in suitable cases&quot; for the loss which has
			<lb />
			resulted to them from such death. This is an important aspect in as
			<lb />
			much as a dependant may not necessarily be an heir of the
			<lb />
			deceased. Therefore, so far as the person who would entitled to
			<lb />
			compensation is concerned, it would include all those who suffer
			<lb />
			loss and damage from the death of the person.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv) &quot;Fine&quot; and &quot;compensation&quot; -distinction, if any.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			325. Section 357 of the CrPC empowers the court to make
			<lb />
			directions towards which a fine may be applied which includes
			<lb />
			towards paying compensation. Section 357(1)(b) also enables the
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 256
			<lb />
			court to direct payment of compensation, if a sentence of fine has
			<lb />
			not been imposed. Section 357(3) what then is the difference
			<lb />
			between a &apos;fine&apos; and &apos;compensation&apos;. Light is thrown on this issue
			<lb />
			by the pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (2007) 6
			<lb />
			SCC 528, Dilip S. Dahanukar v. Kotak Mahindra Co.. This case
			<lb />
			arose under the Negotiable Instruments Act in the context of
			<lb />
			dishonouring of a cheque. The court considered the import of the
			<lb />
			different sub-sections of Section 357, the issue of the difference
			<lb />
			between fine and compensation as well as the recoverability
			<lb />
			thereof and observed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-11. A statute must be read harmoniously. An amount of
			<lb />
			compensation directed to be paid may not form part of a
			<lb />
			fine. It may be awarded separately. It may be
			<lb />
			recoverable as if it is a fine in terms of Section 431 of the
			<lb />
			Code but by reason thereof it would not become
			<lb />
			automatically recoverable forthwith. The legal position,
			<lb />
			however, must be considered keeping in view the purport
			<lb />
			and object of the Act.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			26. The distinction between sub-sections (1) and (3) of
			<lb />
			Section 357 is apparent. Sub-section (1) provides for
			<lb />
			application of an amount of fine while imposing a
			<lb />
			sentence of which fine forms a part; whereas sub-section
			<lb />
			(3) calls for a situation where a court imposes a sentence
			<lb />
			of which fine does not form a part of the sentence.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			27. Compensation is awarded towards sufferance of any
			<lb />
			loss or injury by reason of an act for which an accused
			<lb />
			person is sentenced. Although it provides for a criminal
			<lb />
			liability, the amount which has been awarded as
			<lb />
			compensation is considered to be recourse of the victim
			<lb />
			in the same manner which may be granted in a civil
			<lb />
			suit. So far as Appellant 2 is concerned, no fine has been
			<lb />
			imposed on him. He was directed to pay compensation.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			28. The question is as to whether the matter would come
			<lb />
			within the purview of sub-section (3) and if so, whether
			<lb />
			sub-section (2) of Section 357 would automatically be
			<lb />
			attracted.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			29. The purposes for application of fine imposed has
			<lb />
			been set out in Clauses (a) to (d) of sub-section (1) of
			<lb />
			Section 357. Clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 357
			<lb />
			provides for payment of compensation out of the
			<lb />
			amount of fine. The purpose enumerated in Clause (b)
			<lb />
			of sub-section (1) of Section 357 is the same as sub-
			<lb />
			section (3) thereof, the difference being that whereas in
			<lb />
			a case under sub-section (1) fine imposed forms a part
			<lb />
			of the sentence, under sub-section (3) compensation
			<lb />
			can be directed to be paid whence fine does not form a
			<lb />
			part of the sentence.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			30. xxx xxx xxx When, however, fine is not imposed,
			<lb />
			compensation can be directed to be paid for loss or
			<lb />
			injury caused to the complainant by reason of
			<lb />
			commission of the offence. Clause (b) of sub-section (1)
			<lb />
			of Section 357 only provides for application of amount of
			<lb />
			fine which may be in respect of the entire amount or in
			<lb />
			respect of a part thereof. Sub-section (3) of Section 357
			<lb />
			seeks to achieve the same purpose.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			31. We must, however, observe that there exists a
			<lb />
			distinction between fine and compensation, although, in
			<lb />
			a way it seeks to achieve the same purpose. An amount
			<lb />
			of compensation can be directed to be recovered as a
			<lb />
			-fine‖ but the legal fiction raised in relation to recovery
			<lb />
			of fine only, it is in that sense -fine‖ stands on a higher
			<lb />
			footing than compensation awarded by the court.

			33. In Rachhpal Singh v. State of Punjab [(2002) 6 SCC
			<lb />
			462 : 2002 SCC (Cri) 1362] this Court held: (SCC p. 469,
			<lb />
			para 12)
			<lb />
			-A perusal of the operative part of the judgment of
			<lb />
			the High Court clearly shows that so far as the
			<lb />
			punishment under Section 302 is concerned, it has
			<lb />
			disagreed with the Sessions Court and altered the
			<lb />
			sentence to one of life imprisonment from death. It
			<lb />
			has nowhere stated that it is also awarding a fine or
			<lb />
			that it was confirming the fine awarded by the
			<lb />
			Sessions Court for the offence under Section 302
			<lb />
			IPC. In the absence of any such specific recording
			<lb />
			in our opinion, it should be deemed that the High
			<lb />
			Court has awarded only a sentence of life
			<lb />
			imprisonment for an offence under Section 302
			<lb />
			IPC. In such cases where the court does not award
			<lb />
			a fine along with a substantive sentence, Section
			<lb />
			357(3) comes into play and it is open to the court
			<lb />
			to award compensation to the victim or his
			<lb />
			family. In our opinion it is in the exercise of this
			<lb />
			power under Section 357(3) that the High Court
			<lb />
			has awarded the compensation in question,
			<lb />
			therefore, it was well within the jurisdiction of the
			<lb />
			High Court.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			326. In (2002) 6 SCC 462 Rachpal Singh v. State of Punjab, the
			<lb />
			Sessions Judge had found the appellant and three other persons
			<lb />
			guilty under Section 302 IPC. Appellants 1 and 2 were sentenced
			<lb />
			to death while others were sentenced to life imprisonment.
			<lb />
			Varying prison sentences were imposed for commission of other
			<lb />
			offences. The death sentences were put up for confirmation.
			<lb />
			Appeals challenging the convictions and sentences were filed by
			<lb />
			the appellants. The complainant filed a revision petition praying
			<lb />
			for inter alia compensation. The High Court rejected the challenge
			<lb />
			to the convictions, but did not agree with the imposition of the
			<lb />
			death sentence as well as the guilt of the three more persons. It
			<lb />
			was also concluded that this was a fit case for the exercise of its
			<lb />
			jurisdiction under section 357 Crl. and directed each of the accused
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 259
			<lb />
			to pay Rs.2 lakh (totalling Rs.4 lakhs as compensation and in
			<lb />
			default, imposed a default sentence of 5 years RI on each of the
			<lb />
			appellants which was to run consecutively with the life sentence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			327. The Supreme Court noted that there was insufficient material
			<lb />
			regarding paying capacity of the appellants so it modified and
			<lb />
			reduced the compensation to Rs.1 lakh each.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			328. In Dilip S. Dahanukar, the Supreme Court also considered
			<lb />
			precedents on the issue of the jurisdiction of the High Court in an
			<lb />
			appeal to award compensation, even if no fine is imposed or vice
			<lb />
			versa, and noted that though the considerations for fine and
			<lb />
			compensation are different, the purpose for award thereof is the
			<lb />
			same in paras 34, 35 and 41 which read as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-34. Yet
			<lb />
			again
			<lb />
			in State
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			Punjab v. Gurmej
			<lb />
			Singh [(2002) 6 SCC 663 : 2002 SCC (Cri) 1460] we
			<lb />
			may notice, a similar conclusion was arrived at although
			<lb />
			in a somewhat different fact situation: (SCC pp. 669-70,
			<lb />
			para 11)
			<lb />
			-11. In the present case, sentence of fine has also
			<lb />
			been imposed, as indicated in the earlier part of
			<lb />
			this judgment. Out of the fine, a sum of Rs 1000
			<lb />
			each had been ordered to be given to the three
			<lb />
			injured persons, namely, Dalip Singh, Amarjit
			<lb />
			Kaur and Gurmeet Kaur. The balance amount is to
			<lb />
			go to the legal heirs of Jagjit Singh. We had heard
			<lb />
			the learned counsel for both parties on this aspect.
			<lb />
			Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that
			<lb />
			Gurmeet Kaur lost both her parents as well as her
			<lb />
			brother in the incident and now she is alone and
			<lb />
			would have become of marriageable age or may
			<lb />
			have to start some work of her own. She would
			<lb />
			need some money. In case she cannot be
			<lb />
			compensated, the amount of fine may be enhanced
			<lb />
			to some extent. Learned counsel for the respondent
			<lb />
			has, however, submitted that out of seven acres of
			<lb />
			land belonging to his father, the same has been
			<lb />
			divided into three equal shares and some of it is
			<lb />
			also under mortgage and he has got two daughters
			<lb />
			and a son and his wife. He has also submitted that
			<lb />
			whenever the respondent was released on parole he
			<lb />
			met Gurmeet Kaur and his wife also keeps on
			<lb />
			going to meet her. Their relations are normal and
			<lb />
			cordial. If that is so, nothing better can be thought
			<lb />
			of in the prevailing circumstances. However, we
			<lb />
			are not considering for awarding any compensation
			<lb />
			to Gurmeet Kaur under Section 357(3) CrPC but
			<lb />
			the amount of fine imposed, can in any case be
			<lb />
			reasonably enhanced.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			35. It is, therefore, seen that consideration for payment
			<lb />
			of compensation is somewhat different from payment of
			<lb />
			fine. It is, to the said extent applied differently. As would
			<lb />
			be noticed a little later, it is necessary to probe into the
			<lb />
			capacity of the accused to pay the amount and the
			<lb />
			purpose for which it is directed to be paid.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />

			<lb />

			<lb />
			41. Even in a case where violation of fundamental right
			<lb />
			guaranteed under Article 21 is alleged, the amount of
			<lb />
			compensation cannot be arbitrary or unreasonable even
			<lb />
			under public law.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			329. In paras 32, 42, 45, 46 and 48, the court held that the
			<lb />
			interdiction to recovery of fine under Section 357(2) during the
			<lb />
			period for appeal would apply to recovery of compensation under
			<lb />
			sub-section(3) as well:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-32. If, therefore, under sub-section (2) of Section 357,
			<lb />
			realisation of fine, at least in respect of the factor(s)
			<lb />
			enumerated in Clause (1) of sub-section [sic sub-section
			<lb />
			(1) of Section 357 is] to be stayed automatically, we see
			<lb />
			no reason as to why the legislative intent cannot be held
			<lb />
			to apply in relation to the amount of compensation
			<lb />
			directed to be paid in terms of sub-section (3).

			<lb />
			para 38)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-The quantum of compensation will, however,
			<lb />
			depend upon the facts and circumstances of each
			<lb />
			case. Award of such compensation (by way of
			<lb />
			public law remedy) will not come in the way of the
			<lb />
			aggrieved
			<lb />
			person
			<lb />
			claiming
			<lb />
			additional
			<lb />
			compensation in a civil court, in the enforcement
			<lb />
			of the private law remedy in tort, nor come in the
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Procedure.‖

			<lb />
			section (1) of Section 357 and sub-section (3) of Section
			<lb />
			357 seek to achieve the same purpose. What is necessary
			<lb />
			is to find out the intention of the lawmaker and the object
			<lb />
			sought to be achieved. Sub-section (2) of Section 357
			<lb />
			uses the word -fine‖. It does not say that what would be
			<lb />
			stayed i.e. application of fine. Sub-section (2) of Section
			<lb />
			357, in our opinion, does not contemplate any other
			<lb />
			interpretation. Even assuming that Mr Lalit was correct
			<lb />
			in his submission, still then sub-section (3) would be
			<lb />
			squarely attracted.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			46. The amount of compensation, in view of the legal
			<lb />
			fiction, may be recovered under Section 421 of the Code.
			<lb />
			But the amount of compensation, having regard to sub-
			<lb />
			section (2) of Section 357 of the Code cannot be
			<lb />
			recovered forthwith unless the period of appeal expires.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			48. Section 421 only provides for a mode of recovery of
			<lb />
			fine. Section 424 provides for an enabling clause so as to
			<lb />
			enable the court to take recourse to either of the
			<lb />
			situations provided for therein. The said provisions,
			<lb />
			however, would be subject to sub-section (2) of Section
			<lb />
			357 of the Code. Section 431 of the Code provides for a
			<lb />
			legal fiction in terms whereof any money other than a
			<lb />
			fine shall be recoverable as if it were a fine. Even
			<lb />
			according to Mr Lalit, sub-section (2) of Section 357 of
			<lb />
			the Code would be attracted in such a situation. There
			<lb />
			does not appear to be any reason as to why the amount of
			<lb />
			compensation should be held to be automatically
			<lb />
			payable, although the same is only to be recovered as if a
			<lb />
			fine has been imposed.‖

			330. It is important to note that the legislature does not impose
			<lb />
			any limit on the quantum of either the fine under Sub-Section (1)
			<lb />
			of Section 357 of the Cr.P.C. or of the compensation which may be
			<lb />
			awarded under Section (3) of Section 357 of the Cr.P.C. So far
			<lb />
			fines are concerned, a perusal of the Indian Penal Code shows that
			<lb />
			the quantum of fine does find statutory restriction for some
			<lb />
			offences. For instance, a fine of Rs.500/-for offences under
			<lb />
			Sections 171, 171H, 172, 173, 174 and 175 of IPC; Rs.1,000/-for
			<lb />
			offences of under Sections 176, 177, 178, 179, 182, 188 and 200.
			<lb />
			The legislature has prescribed different punishments for different
			<lb />
			offences. While punishment of only imprisonment or only fine for
			<lb />
			commission of some offences; for others an option of
			<lb />
			imprisonment and fine is available.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			331. The legislature has by Section 63 of the IPC specified that
			<lb />
			-amount of fine‖ provided that where no sum is expressed to which
			<lb />
			a fine may extend, the amount of fine to which the offender is
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 263
			<lb />
			liable is unlimited, but shall not be excessive. However, no limits
			<lb />
			are prescribed for compensation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			332. It needs no further elaboration that while a fine is part of the
			<lb />
			sentence imposed on a convict, compensation is awarded in
			<lb />
			addition thereto. So, the statutory scheme would show that so far
			<lb />
			as a fine is concerned, Section 357 has intervened only to the
			<lb />
			extent that it sets out the purposes of application of the fine in
			<lb />
			clauses (a) to (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 357. The court can
			<lb />
			make an order for payment of compensation out of the amount of
			<lb />
			the fine under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 357.
			<lb />
			However, if the court does not impose a fine, the court can make
			<lb />
			the order directing payment of the compensation under sub-section
			<lb />
			(3) of Section 357. There is however, no difference between spirit,
			<lb />
			intendment or purpose of an order under clause (b) of sub-section
			<lb />
			(1) and the order under sub-section 3 of Section 357. While the
			<lb />
			power to impose a fine may be statutorily limited, no such limits
			<lb />
			are prescribed for payment of compensation.
			<lb />
			This enunciation of law would guide all courts exercising
			<lb />
			sentencing jurisdiction under the Cr.P.C.

			(v) Procedure to be followed and principles for fixation of fine
			<lb />

			<lb />
			calculation of an adequate compensation shall be effected. This
			<lb />
			issue gets even more vexed in cases of homicide.

			principle of liability to deal with an unusual situation
			<lb />
			which has arisen and which is likely to arise in future on
			<lb />
			account of hazardous or inherently dangerous industries
			<lb />
			which are concomitant to an industrial economy, there is
			<lb />
			no reason why we should hesitate to evolve such
			<lb />
			principle of liability xxx xxx xxx.&quot;
			<lb />
			Principles in regard to methodology of assessing
			<lb />
			compensation have thus to be evolved.
			<lb />
			Of course judicial
			<lb />
			precedents on the subject go a long way in providing guidance.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			335. We may usefully refer to the pronouncement of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court reported at (1978) 4 SCC 111 (para 10), Sarwan
			<lb />
			Singh &amp; Ors. v. State of Punjab wherein the Supreme Court had in
			<lb />
			fact laid down a step by step guide for grant of compensation. It
			<lb />
			has been mandated that prior to awarding compensation, the court
			<lb />
			has to first and foremost decide whether the case is a fit one in
			<lb />
			which compensation has to be awarded.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			336. Once the court concludes that compensation should be paid,
			<lb />
			then, as per Sarwan Singh, the capacity of the accused to pay
			<lb />
			compensation is to be determined. The purpose will not be served
			<lb />
			if the accused is unable to pay the compensation awarded.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 265
			<lb />
			Obviously, if the accused is in a position to pay the compensation,
			<lb />
			there would be no reason for the court not to direct payment of
			<lb />
			such compensation.
			<lb />
			The court notes that if a person who caused injury by
			<lb />
			negligence or vicariously is made to pay compensation (for
			<lb />
			instance in motor accident cases), then a person who causes injury
			<lb />
			with mens rea must compensate the victim. In this regard, in para
			<lb />
			11 of Sarwan Singh &amp; Ors. v. State of Punjab, the court is further
			<lb />
			stated thus :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-10. xxx xxx xxx Section 357 (3) provides that
			<lb />
			when a court imposes a sentence, of which fine does not
			<lb />
			form a part, the Court may, when passing judgment,
			<lb />
			order the accused person to pay, by way of
			<lb />
			compensation, such amount, as may be specified in the
			<lb />
			order, to the person who has suffered any loss or injury
			<lb />
			by reason of the act for which the accused person has
			<lb />
			been so sentenced. The object of the section therefore, is
			<lb />
			to provide compensation payable to the persons who are
			<lb />
			entitled to recover damage from the person sentenced
			<lb />
			even though fine does not form part of the sentence.
			<lb />
			Though Section 545 enabled the court only to pay
			<lb />
			compensation out of the fine that would be imposed
			<lb />
			under the law, by Section 357(3) when a Court imposes a
			<lb />
			sentence, of which fine does not form a part, the Court
			<lb />
			may direct the accused to pay compensation. In
			<lb />
			awarding compensation it is necessary for the court to
			<lb />
			decide whether the case is a fit one in which
			<lb />
			compensation has to be awarded. If it is found that
			<lb />
			compensation should be paid, then the capacity of the
			<lb />
			accused to pay a compensation has to be determined. In
			<lb />
			directing compensation, the object is to collect the fine
			<lb />
			and pay it to the person who has suffered the loss. The
			<lb />
			purpose will not be served if the accused is not able to
			<lb />
			pay the fine or compensation for, imposing a default
			<lb />
			sentence for non-payment of fine would not achieve the
			<lb />
			object. If the accused is in a position to pay the
			<lb />
			compensation to the injured or his dependents to which
			<lb />
			they are entitled to, there could be no reason for the
			<lb />
			court not directing such compensation. When a person,
			<lb />
			who caused injury due to negligence or is made
			<lb />
			vicariously liable is bound to pay compensation it is
			<lb />
			only appropriate to direct payment by the accused who
			<lb />
			is guilty of causing an injury with the necessary mens
			<lb />
			rea to pay compensation for the person who has suffered
			<lb />
			injury.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			323. We find that in Sarwan Singh, the court cautioned
			<lb />
			against first ascertaining the compensation and then imposing
			<lb />
			an equivalent fine. In para 11, the Supreme Court further stated
			<lb />
			the relevant circumstances which must be taken into
			<lb />
			consideration in the following terms :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;11. In awarding compensation as cautioned by this
			<lb />
			Court in Palianappa Gounder v. State of T.N. [(1977) 2
			<lb />
			SCC 634 : 1977 SCC (Cri) 397 : (1977) 3 SCR 132] the
			<lb />
			Court should not first consider what compensation
			<lb />
			ought to be awarded to the heirs of the deceased and
			<lb />
			then impose a fine which is higher than the
			<lb />
			compensation. It is the duty of the court to take into
			<lb />
			account the nature of the crime, the injury suffered, the
			<lb />
			justness of the claim for compensation, the capacity of
			<lb />
			the accused to pay and other relevant circumstances in
			<lb />
			fixing the amount of fine or compensation. After
			<lb />
			consideration of all the facts of the case, we feel that in
			<lb />
			addition to the sentence of 5 years rigorous
			<lb />
			imprisonment, a fine of Rs 3500 on each of the accused
			<lb />
			under Section 304(
		</item>
		<p>
			1) IPC should be imposed. The fine
			<lb />
			will be paid as compensation to the widow of the
			<lb />
			deceased, Mewa Singh. In default of payment of fine, the
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 267
			<lb />
			accused will undergo further simple imprisonment for 6
			<lb />
			months.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
			It is therefore, well settled that the courts must conduct an
			<lb />
			enquiry, even a summary one into, fitness of the case for award of
			<lb />
			fine and compensation, persons entitled to compensation, paying
			<lb />
			capacity of the accused and any other relevant factor.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			337. We have till here examined the procedure which courts
			<lb />
			would be required to follow for awarding compensation under
			<lb />
			Section 357 Cr.P.C. Having found the persons who are entitled to
			<lb />
			compensation, thereafter having ascertained the means and paying
			<lb />
			capacity of the defendants, it is necessary to determine
			<lb />
			quantification of compensation payable to them as would be just
			<lb />
			and adequate. The legislation gives no guidance at all on this
			<lb />
			question as well.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			338. Let us briefly examine some judicial precedents placed
			<lb />
			before us regarding quantum of compensation. In para 11, the
			<lb />
			judgment reported at (1988) 4 SCC 551 Hari Singh v. Sukhbir
			<lb />
			Singh, the Supreme Court also stated that the payment by way
			<lb />
			of compensation must, however, be reasonable; what is
			<lb />
			reasonable, may depend upon the facts and circumstances of
			<lb />
			each case. No hard and fast rule can therefore be laid.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			339. We may also refer to the pronouncements of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court reported at (1995) 6 SCC 593, Baldev Singh v. State of
			<lb />
			Punjab. In para 17, for the purposes of sentencing, the court took
			<lb />
			into consideration the circumstances that the arms possessed by the
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 268
			<lb />
			accused as not being inherently dangerous to infer their intention
			<lb />
			was to cause death or that the accused had knowledge that by
			<lb />
			inflicting the injuries as was done, death was likely to be caused.
			<lb />
			The court also noted that the appellants had inflicted injuries only
			<lb />
			on the thigh and at the back and that there was no evidence or
			<lb />
			finding as to who caused the fatal injuries which resulted in the
			<lb />
			death of Balbir Singh; that the incident happened almost 11 years
			<lb />
			ago as well as the fact that the injuries inflicted on the thigh of
			<lb />
			Amrik Singh resulting in the death of the victim by the appellant
			<lb />
			were not proved to be serious or fatal and that the incident arose
			<lb />
			out of a property dispute. In these circumstances, the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court observed that the widow and children of the deceased, Balbir
			<lb />
			Singh are the persons to suffer and they should not be forgotten
			<lb />
			and that by merely maintaining the sentence of imprisonment on
			<lb />
			the accused, the victim or his heirs are not benefitted. Observing
			<lb />
			the near relationship of the accused and the victim as well as the
			<lb />
			fact that the appellants were in a position to pay, the court was of
			<lb />
			the view that it was a fit case in which Section 357(3) of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. could be invoked and a just and reasonable compensation
			<lb />
			given to the family of the deceased. The court accordingly directed
			<lb />
			the appellants to pay by way of compensation Rs.35,000/-each to
			<lb />
			the widow of the deceased and the children within three months of
			<lb />
			the date of order failing which they would be entitled to recover the
			<lb />
			amount as if the direction to pay compensation was a decree passed
			<lb />
			against them by the court. In case, the appellants did not pay, the
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 269
			<lb />
			appellants were liable to undergo the remainder of the sentence
			<lb />
			awarded by the trial court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			340. We have noted above the statutory position whereunder no
			<lb />
			outer limit is prescribed for award of compensation. In para 68 of
			<lb />
			(2007) 6 SCC 528, Dilip S. Dahanukar v. Kotak Mahindra Co.
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court has stated that the very fact that the Parliament
			<lb />
			did not think it fit to put a ceiling in regard to the amount of
			<lb />
			compensation leviable upon an accused, the discretionary
			<lb />
			jurisdiction thereto must be exercised judicially. The observations
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court throw valuable light on the issue deserve to
			<lb />
			be extracted in extenso and read as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;39. If a fine is to be imposed under the Act, the amount
			<lb />
			of which in the opinion of Parliament would be more
			<lb />
			than sufficient to compensate the complainant; can it be
			<lb />
			said, that an unreasonable amount should be directed to
			<lb />
			be paid by the court while exercising its power under
			<lb />
			sub-section (3) of Section 357? The answer thereto must
			<lb />
			be rendered in the negative. Sub-section (5) of Section
			<lb />
			357 also provides for some guidelines. Ordinarily, it
			<lb />
			should be lesser than the amount which can be granted
			<lb />
			by a civil court upon appreciation of the evidence
			<lb />
			brought before it for losses which might have
			<lb />
			reasonably been suffered by the plaintiff. Jurisdiction of
			<lb />
			the civil court, in this behalf, for realisation of the
			<lb />
			amount in question must also be borne in mind. A
			<lb />
			criminal case is not a substitution for a civil suit, far
			<lb />
			less execution of a decree which may be passed.‖

			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 270
			<lb />
			It is therefore evident that the quantum of fine and
			<lb />
			compensation rests on the facts and circumstances of each case. It
			<lb />
			has to be rationally and reasonably fixed, not in the manner of a
			<lb />
			civil suit does after appreciation of evidence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			341. In (2008) 8 SCC 225, Manish Jalan v. State, para 14, the
			<lb />
			court reiterated the principles laid down in Sarwan Singh v. State
			<lb />
			of Punjab in the following terms:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;14. However, in awarding compensation, it is necessary
			<lb />
			for the court to decide if the case is a fit one in which
			<lb />
			compensation deserves to be awarded. If the court is
			<lb />
			convinced that compensation should be paid, then the
			<lb />
			quantum of compensation is to be determined by taking
			<lb />
			into consideration the nature of the crime, the injury
			<lb />
			suffered and the capacity of the convict to pay
			<lb />
			compensation, etc. It goes without saying that the
			<lb />
			amount of compensation has to be reasonable, which
			<lb />
			the person concerned is able to pay. If the accused is not
			<lb />
			in a position to pay the compensation to the injured or his
			<lb />
			dependents to which they are held to be entitled to, there
			<lb />
			could be no reason for the court to direct such
			<lb />
			compensation.
			<lb />
			(See Sarwan
			<lb />
			Singh v. State
			<lb />
			of

			342. In para 38 of (2007) 6 SCC 528, Dilip S. Dahanukar v.
			<lb />
			Kotak Mahindra Co., the Supreme Court observed thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;38. The purpose of imposition of fine and/or grant of
			<lb />
			compensation to a great extent must be considered
			<lb />
			having the relevant factors therefore in mind. It may be
			<lb />
			compensating the person in one way or the other.
			<lb />
			The amount of compensation sought to be imposed,
			<lb />
			thus, must be reasonable and not arbitrary. Before
			<lb />
			issuing a direction to pay compensation, the capacity of
			<lb />
			the accused to pay the same must be judged. A fortiori,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 271
			<lb />
			an enquiry in this behalf even in a summary way, may be
			<lb />
			necessary. Some reasons, which may
		</p>
		<item>
			not be very
			<lb />
			elaborate, may also have to be assigned; the purpose
			<lb />
			being that whereas the power to impose fine is limited
			<lb />
			and direction to pay compensation can be made for one
			<lb />
			or the other factors enumerated out of the same; but
			<lb />
			sub-section (3) of Section 357 does not impose any such
			<lb />
			limitation and thus, power thereunder should be
			<lb />
			exercised only in appropriate cases. Such a jurisdiction
			<lb />
			cannot be exercised at the whims and caprice of a
			<lb />
			judge.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			343. In para 66 of (2013) 6 SCC 770, Ankush Shivaji Gaikwad v.
			<lb />
			State of Maharashtra, the Supreme Court summed up the method
			<lb />
			to be adopted by the court and principles on which an order for
			<lb />
			imposition of fine and compensation would be made which reads
			<lb />
			thus :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;66. xxx xxx xxx Application of mind to the question is
			<lb />
			best disclosed by recording reasons for awarding/refusing
			<lb />
			compensation. It is axiomatic that for any exercise
			<lb />
			involving application of mind, the Court ought to have
			<lb />
			the necessary material which it would evaluate to arrive
			<lb />
			at a fair and reasonable conclusion. It is also beyond
			<lb />
			dispute that the occasion to consider the question of
			<lb />
			award of compensation would logically arise only after
			<lb />
			the court records a conviction of the accused. Capacity
			<lb />
			of the accused to pay which constitutes an important
			<lb />
			aspect of any order under Section 357 CrPC would
			<lb />
			involve a certain enquiry albeit summary unless
			<lb />
			of course the facts as emerging in the course of the trial
			<lb />
			are so clear that the court considers it unnecessary to
			<lb />
			do so. Such an enquiry can precede an order on
			<lb />
			sentence to enable the court to take a view, both on
			<lb />
			the question of sentence and compensation that it may
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 272
			<lb />
			in its wisdom decide to award to the victim or his/her
			<lb />
			family.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			344. We may note that the summary enquiry ought to include into
			<lb />
			the conditions of the victims and the impact of the crime on them.
			<lb />
			It would also be essential to enquire into and obtain relevant
			<lb />
			material regarding the other components of Section 357(1) to
			<lb />
			enable the court to pass a truly meaningful order.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vi) Can a compensation order impact the severity of the
			<lb />
			sentence imposed?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			345. There is another aspect of sentencing jurisprudence when
			<lb />
			payment of compensation is directed. Several pronouncements
			<lb />
			would show that in cases where compensation has been enhanced
			<lb />
			by the appellate court or the revisional court, notional sentences
			<lb />
			have been imposed. Can a compensation order be permitted to
			<lb />
			impact the severity of the sentence imposed? It is contended by
			<lb />
			Mr. Sumeet Verma, learned counsel for Vikas Yadav as well that if
			<lb />
			the court is directing payment of a higher amount, then a lesser
			<lb />
			sentence ought to be imposed on the defendants.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			346. We find that this practice has been deprecated by the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court.
			<lb />
			In (2013) 9 SCC 516, Hazara Singh v. Raj Kumar &amp; Ors.,
			<lb />
			the court relied on the prior pronouncement reported at (1985) 3
			<lb />
			SCC 225, Sadha Singh v. State of Punjab (paras 7 and 8) and
			<lb />
			deprecated the practice of lesser imprisonment, against higher
			<lb />
			compensation.
			<lb />
			It held that accepting the submission that
			<lb />
			compensation stood increased and therefore, sentence of
			<lb />
			imprisonment should not be enhanced would mean that -if your
			<lb />
			pockets can afford, commit serious crime, offer to pay heavy fine
			<lb />
			and escape tentacles of law. Power of wealth need not extend to
			<lb />
			overawe court processes‖.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			347. On this very aspect, in its 42 nd Report, the Law Commission
			<lb />
			of India has observed thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-3.17. We have a fairly comprehensive provision for
			<lb />
			payment of compensation to the injured party under
			<lb />
			Section 545 of the Criminal Procedure Code. It is
			<lb />
			regrettable that our courts do not exercise their salutary
			<lb />
			powers under this section as freely and liberally as could
			<lb />
			be desired. The section has, no doubt, its limitations. Its
			<lb />
			application depends, in the first instance, on whether the
			<lb />
			court considers a substantial fine proper punishment for
			<lb />
			the offence. In the more serious cases, the court may
			<lb />
			think that a heavy fine in addition to imprisonment for
			<lb />
			a long term is not justifiable, especially when the Public
			<lb />
			Prosecutor ignores the plight of the victim of the offence
			<lb />
			and does not press for compensation on his behalf.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			348. In the pronouncement reported at (2012) 8 SCC 734, Guru
			<lb />
			Basavaraj v. State of Karnataka, the court has specifically ruled
			<lb />
			that compensation is not a substitute for adequacy sentence. This
			<lb />
			case arose in the context of conviction for an offence punishable
			<lb />
			under Section 304A of the IPC. The observations of the court in
			<lb />
			paras 30 and 32 may be usefully extracted and read thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-30. From the aforesaid authorities, it is luminous that
			<lb />
			this Court has expressed its concern on imposition of
			<lb />
			adequate sentence in respect of commission of offences
			<lb />
			regard being had to the nature of the offence and
			<lb />
			demand of the conscience of the society. That apart, the
			<lb />
			concern has been to impose adequate sentence for the
			<lb />
			offence punishable under Section 304-A IPC. It is
			<lb />
			worthy to note that in certain circumstances, the
			<lb />
			mitigating factors have been taken into consideration but
			<lb />
			the said aspect is dependent on the facts of each case.
			<lb />
			xxx xxx xxx Grant of compensation under Section
			<lb />
			357(3) CrPC with a direction that the same should be
			<lb />
			paid to the person who has suffered any loss or injury
			<lb />
			by reason of the act for which the accused has been
			<lb />
			sentenced has a different contour and the same is not to
			<lb />
			be regarded as a substitute in all circumstances for
			<lb />
			adequate sentence.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />

			<lb />

			<lb />
			32. We may note with profit that an appropriate
			<lb />
			punishment works as an eye-opener for the persons
			<lb />
			who are not careful while driving vehicles on the road
			<lb />
			and exhibit a careless attitude possibly harbouring the
			<lb />
			notion that they would be shown indulgence or lives of
			<lb />
			others are like -flies to the wanton boys‖. They totally
			<lb />
			forget that the lives of many are in their hands, and the
			<lb />
			sublimity of safety of a human being is given an indecent
			<lb />
			burial by their rash and negligent act.‖

		<p>
			349. We find that in para 21 of the judgment reported at (2010) 6
			<lb />
			SCC 230, K.A Abbas H.S.A. v. Sabu Joseph, the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			has relied on the pronouncement reported at (1985) 7 Cri APP
			<lb />
			R(S) 272, R v. Oliver John Huish wherein the court had pointed
			<lb />
			out the possibility of misuse of an order of imposition of a light
			<lb />
			sentence of imprisonment to enable the defendant to comply with a
			<lb />
			compensation order. The court has noted that if the defendant does
			<lb />
			not pay, he has got off with a light sentence and, in effect, no order
			<lb />
			to pay compensation. Para 21 of the judgment on the issue reads
			<lb />
			thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			21. This position also finds support in R. v. Oliver John
			<lb />
			Huish [(1985) 7 Cri App R (S) 272] . The Lord Justice
			<lb />
			Croom Johnson speaking for the Bench has observed:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-When compensation orders may possibly be
			<lb />
			made the most careful examination is required.
			<lb />
			Documents should be obtained and evidence
			<lb />
			either on affidavit or orally should be given. The
			<lb />
			proceedings should, if necessary, be adjourned,
			<lb />
			in order to arrive at the true state of the
			<lb />
			defendant&apos;s affairs.
			<lb />
			Very often a compensation order is made and a
			<lb />
			very light sentence of imprisonment is imposed,
			<lb />
			because the court recognizes that if the defendant
			<lb />
			is to have an opportunity of paying the
			<lb />
			compensation he must be enabled to earn the
			<lb />
			money with which to do so. The result is therefore
			<lb />
			an extremely light sentence of imprisonment. If
			<lb />
			the compensation order turns out to be virtually
			<lb />
			worthless, the defendant has got off with a very
			<lb />
			light sentence of imprisonment as well as no
			<lb />
			order of compensation. In other words, generally
			<lb />
			speaking, he has got off with everything.‖

			350. A compensation order is not a part of a sentence. The
			<lb />
			practice of a heavier compensation order resulting in a small
			<lb />
			sentence is clearly contrary to the very basis of sentencing. If
			<lb />
			applied, there is a large possibility of it being misused. It would
			<lb />
			certainly result in miscarriage of justice. The submissions of Mr.
			<lb />
			Sumeet Verma, learned counsel for Vikas Yadav, to the effect that

			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 276
			<lb />
			heavy fine or a compensation would be payable only against a
			<lb />
			lesser imprisonment sentence is clearly untenable and is hereby
			<lb />
			rejected. It is settled law that compensation is not a substitute to a
			<lb />
			sentence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vii) Quantification of compensation
			<lb />
			351. We now come to the critical question -having ascertained
			<lb />
			the paying capacity of the defendants, the particulars and
			<lb />
			circumstances of the crime, the victims, dependants and all other
			<lb />
			relevant information, how is the compensation to be awarded?
			<lb />
			This question is not unique to Section 357 of the Cr.P.C. No fault
			<lb />
			liability for compensation is awarded under the Motor Vehicles
			<lb />
			Act. It is also to be found in the Fatal Accidents Act and Workmen
			<lb />
			Compensation Act. Public law remedies provide compensation for
			<lb />
			violation of constitutional rights and even tortious actions of public
			<lb />
			authorities are legally recognised. There are several judicial
			<lb />
			precedents wherein compensation stands awarded therein. What
			<lb />
			was the basis for the orders passed in these jurisdictions? Can we
			<lb />
			draw on the experience of awarding compensation in these
			<lb />
			jurisdictions and under these enactments for the purposes of
			<lb />
			awarding compensation under Section 357 of the Cr.P.C.?
			<lb />
			We now propose to examine this very important issue.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(viii) Public law remedies for established violations of
			<lb />
			constitutional rights and principles for determining
			<lb />
			compensation
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			352. A public remedy to award compensation for violation of
			<lb />
			fundamental rights was evolved on application of principles of
			<lb />
			compensatory justice in (1983) 4 SCC 141, Rudul Sah v. State of
			<lb />
			Bihar &amp; Anr. This stands reiterated in several cases of Supreme
			<lb />
			Court thereafter.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			353. It is essential to note that in (1997) 1 SCC 416, D.K.
			<lb />
			Basu v. State of W.B., the Supreme Court was concerned with
			<lb />
			custodial violations including torture, rape, death in police
			<lb />
			custody/lock-up which not only infringed Article 21 rights but also
			<lb />
			basic human rights and struck a blow on the rule of law. The
			<lb />
			Supreme Court issued mandatory directions in the shape of
			<lb />
			&apos;requirements&apos; for compliance by police personnel while arresting
			<lb />
			or detaining any person in addition to constitutional and statutory
			<lb />
			safeguards as well as previous directions of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			which were to govern all enforcement agencies. It was while
			<lb />
			dealing with these issues that the Supreme Court in para 41,
			<lb />
			observed as follows&quot;
			<lb />
			&quot;41. ... Prosecution of the offender is an obligation of
			<lb />
			the State in case of every crime but the victim of crime
			<lb />
			needs to be compensated monetarily also. The Court,
			<lb />
			where the infringement of the fundamental right is
			<lb />
			established, therefore, cannot stop by giving a mere
			<lb />
			declaration. It must proceed further and give
			<lb />
			compensatory relief, not by way of damages as in a civil
			<lb />
			action but by way of compensation under the public law
			<lb />
			jurisdiction for the wrong done, due to breach of public
			<lb />
			duty by the State of not protecting the fundamental right
			<lb />
			to life of the citizen. To repair the wrong done and give
			<lb />
			judicial redress for legal injury is a compulsion of
			<lb />
			judicial conscience.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			354. In para 42 of D.K. Basu, the court also noted that there was
			<lb />
			no express provision in the Constitution of India for grant of
			<lb />
			compensation for violation of a fundamental right to life and that
			<lb />
			the court had judicially evolved a right to compensation in cases of
			<lb />
			established unconstitutional deprivation of personal liberty or life.
			<lb />
			On the question of relegating a victim of a criminal offence for
			<lb />
			compensation from the offender to a civil remedy, which is under
			<lb />
			consideration by us, the following observations of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court, though rendered in the context of State responsibility for
			<lb />
			infringements by public servants are illuminating and would guide
			<lb />
			our consideration as well:
			<lb />
			-45. The old doctrine of only relegating the aggrieved to
			<lb />
			the remedies available in civil law limits the role of the
			<lb />
			courts too much, as the protector and custodian of the
			<lb />
			indefeasible rights of the citizens. The courts have the
			<lb />
			obligation to satisfy the social aspirations of the citizens
			<lb />
			because the courts and the law are for the people and
			<lb />
			expected to respond to their aspirations. A court of law
			<lb />
			cannot close its consciousness and aliveness to stark
			<lb />
			realities. Mere punishment of the offender cannot give
			<lb />
			much solace to the family of the victim -civil action
			<lb />
			for damages is a long drawn and a cumbersome judicial
			<lb />
			process. Monetary compensation for redressal by the
			<lb />
			court finding the infringement of the indefeasible right
			<lb />
			to life of the citizen is, therefore, useful and at time
			<lb />
			perhaps the only effective remedy to apply balm to the
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 279
			<lb />
			wounds of the family members of the deceased victim,
			<lb />
			who may have been the breadwinner of the family.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			54. xxx xxx xxx the citizen must receive the amount of
			<lb />
			compensation from the State, which shall have the right
			<lb />
			to be indemnified by the wrongdoer. In the assessment of
			<lb />
			compensation, the emphasis has to be on the
			<lb />
			compensatory and not on punitive element. The
			<lb />
			objective is to apply balm to the wounds and not to
			<lb />
			punish the transgressor or the offender, as awarding
			<lb />
			appropriate punishment for the offence (irrespective of
			<lb />
			compensation) must be left to the criminal courts in
			<lb />
			which the offender is prosecuted, which the State, in
			<lb />
			law, is duty bound to do. The award of compensation in
			<lb />
			the public law jurisdiction is also without prejudice to
			<lb />
			any other action like civil suit for damages which is
			<lb />
			lawfully available to the victim or the heirs of the
			<lb />
			deceased victim with respect to the same matter for the
			<lb />
			tortious act committed by the functionaries of the State.
			<lb />
			The quantum of compensation will, of course, depend
			<lb />
			upon the peculiar facts of each case and no strait-jacket
			<lb />
			formula can be evolved in that behalf. The relief to
			<lb />
			redress the wrong for the established invasion of the
			<lb />
			fundamental rights of the citizen, under the public law
			<lb />
			jurisdiction is, thus, in addition to the traditional
			<lb />
			remedies and not in derogation of them. The amount of
			<lb />
			compensation as awarded by the Court and paid by the
			<lb />
			State to redress the wrong done, may in a given case, be
			<lb />
			adjusted against any amount which may be awarded to
			<lb />
			the claimant by way of damages in a civil suit.‖

		<p>
			355. In the pronouncement of the Supreme Court in (2006) 3 SCC
			<lb />
			178, Sube Singh v. State of Haryana, it was stated thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-38. xxx The quantum of compensation will, however,
			<lb />
			depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.
			<lb />
			Award of such compensation (by way of public law
			<lb />
			remedy) will not come in the way of the aggrieved
			<lb />
			person claiming additional compensation in a civil
			<lb />
			court, in the enforcement of the private law remedy in
			<lb />
			tort, nor come in the way of the criminal court ordering
			<lb />
			compensation under Section 357 of the Code of
			<lb />
			Criminal Procedure.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			356. The court thus held that the award of compensation by way
			<lb />
			of public law remedy would not impede the criminal court from
			<lb />
			ordering compensation under Section 357 of the Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			357. In (2005) 117 DLT 112, Ashwani Gupta v. Government of
			<lb />
			India, this court was concerned with grant of compensation to the
			<lb />
			petitioner aged about 19 years who suffered 90% disability of
			<lb />
			permanent nature as a result of a bomb blast. The court noted that
			<lb />
			the crime had been committed and wrong had been done to a
			<lb />
			citizen who had suffered disability. Though concerned with the
			<lb />
			public law remedy, reliance was placed on the observations of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in (1997) 1 SCC 416, D.K. Basu v. State of W.B.
			<lb />
			on the propriety of relegating person so injured seeking reparation
			<lb />
			against the State to civil remedies.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			358. While D.K. Basu was concerned with murder, torture, rape,
			<lb />
			etc. of prisoners while in custody as a violation of the right to life
			<lb />
			Article 21 of the Constitution of India, the defendants before us
			<lb />
			stand convicted of the offence of murder of a young 23 year old
			<lb />
			boy whose rights under Article 21 were violated. At the same
			<lb />
			time, the right to life of witnesses in the case has been interfered
			<lb />
			with and they are till date living with a threat to life. While the
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 281
			<lb />
			present case is concerned with violation of constitutional rights not
			<lb />
			by public servants but by members of the public, the principles laid
			<lb />
			down in the above judicial pronouncements with regard to
			<lb />
			compensation would apply to the consideration by the court.
			<lb />
			Witnesses in the present also are still living under fear and with
			<lb />
			police protection.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			359. Damages are also imposed in tortious claims in an effort to
			<lb />
			place the claimants in a position that they would have been, had the
			<lb />
			incident not taken place. These are generally quantified under the
			<lb />
			heads of general damages and special damages. Punitive damages
			<lb />
			are intended to reform or to deter the wrongdoer from indulging in
			<lb />
			conduct similar to that which formed the basis of claim.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			360. The modes of determination of compensation remain
			<lb />
			inchoate, uncertain and inconsistent. A method which ensures
			<lb />
			unity and consistency and lends predictability today in the decision
			<lb />
			making stands statutorily recognised in Section 163A of the Motor
			<lb />
			Vehicles Act. This is the multiplier method of computation which
			<lb />
			stands followed in jurisprudence arising in exercise of public law
			<lb />
			remedy; adjudication of claims in tort; iner alia is cases arising
			<lb />
			under the Fatal Accidents Act as well as the Workmen
			<lb />
			Compensation Act etc.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			361. In a case of a devastating fire which took place at
			<lb />
			Jamshedpur, the Supreme Court reported at (2001) 8 SCC 151,
			<lb />
			M.S. Grewal &amp; Anr. v. Deep Chand Sood &amp; Ors., a case where
			<lb />
			school children died due to negligence of school teachers. The
			<lb />
			court used the multiplier method for computation of adequate
			<lb />
			compensation. It was observed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;8. Incidentally, this Court in C.K. Subramania
			<lb />
			Iyer v. T. Kunhikuttan Nair [(1969) 3 SCC 64] while
			<lb />
			dealing with the matter of fatal accidents laid down
			<lb />
			certain relevant guidelines for the purpose of assessment
			<lb />
			of compensation. Para 13 of the Report would be
			<lb />
			relevant on this score and the same is set out
			<lb />
			hereinbelow: (SCC p. 70, para 13)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-13. The law on the point arising for decision may
			<lb />
			be summed up thus: Compulsory damages under
			<lb />
			Section 1-A of the Act for wrongful death must be
			<lb />
			limited strictly to the pecuniary loss to the
			<lb />
			beneficiaries and that under Section 2, the measure
			<lb />
			of damages is the economic loss sustained by the
			<lb />
			estate. There can be no exact uniform rule for
			<lb />
			measuring the value of the human life and the
			<lb />
			measure of damages cannot be arrived at by
			<lb />
			precise mathematical calculations but the amount
			<lb />
			recoverable depends on the particular facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of each case. The life expectancy
			<lb />
			of the deceased or of the beneficiaries whichever is
			<lb />
			shorter is an important factor. Since the elements
			<lb />
			which go to make up the value of the life of the
			<lb />
			deceased to the designated beneficiaries are
			<lb />
			necessarily personal to each case, in the very
			<lb />
			nature of things, there can be no exact or uniform
			<lb />
			rule for measuring the value of human life. In
			<lb />
			assessing damages, the Court must exclude all
			<lb />
			considerations of matter which rest in speculation
			<lb />
			or fancy though conjecture to some extent is
			<lb />
			inevitable. As a general rule parents are entitled to
			<lb />
			recover the present cash value of the prospective
			<lb />
			service of the deceased minor child. In addition
			<lb />
			they may receive compensation for loss of
			<lb />
			pecuniary benefits reasonably to be expected after
			<lb />
			the child attains majority. In the matter of

			&quot;28. Currently judicial attitude has taken a shift from the
			<lb />
			old draconian concept and the traditional jurisprudential
			<lb />
			system -affectation of the people has been taken note
			<lb />
			of rather seriously and the judicial concern thus stands on
			<lb />
			a footing to provide expeditious relief to an individual
			<lb />
			when needed rather than taking recourse to the old
			<lb />
			conservative doctrine of the civil court&apos;s obligation to
			<lb />
			award damages. As a matter of fact the decision in D.K.
			<lb />
			Basu [(1997) 1 SCC 416 : 1997 SCC (Cri) 92] has not
			<lb />
			only dealt with the issue in a manner apposite to the
			<lb />
			social need of the country but the learned Judge with his
			<lb />
			usual felicity of expression firmly established the current
			<lb />
			trend of -justice-oriented approach‖. Law courts will lose
			<lb />
			their efficacy if they cannot possibly respond to the need
			<lb />
			of the society -technicalities there might be many but
			<lb />
			the justice-oriented approach ought not to be thwarted on
			<lb />
			the basis of such technicality since technicality cannot

			criminal culpability or criminality. So far as computation of
			<lb />
			compensation under Section 357 of the Cr.P.C. is concerned, it is
			<lb />
			to be imposed against persons who have been held guilty in
			<lb />
			criminal trials of commission of serious criminal offences which
			<lb />
			have been violently committed with premeditation and careful
			<lb />
			planning. Often, these defendants are well placed in life and may
			<lb />
			be persons of substantial means. In other words they have the
			<lb />
			paying capacity to adequately compensate the victims/dependants
			<lb />
			for the loss which has enured. Just as in Kunal Sah award of the
			<lb />
			strict and conservative compensation which may result by
			<lb />
			application of the multiplier method, may be inconsequential -it
			<lb />
			would certainly not have any deterrent effect.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			370. In the context of motor accident claims, the multiplier
			<lb />
			method was approved as back as in the year 1996 in the
			<lb />
			pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (1996) 4 SCC
			<lb />
			362, U.P. State Road Transport Corporation &amp; Ors. v. Trilok
			<lb />
			Chandra &amp; Ors. as the accepted method for determining and
			<lb />
			ensuring payment of just compensation which was expected to
			<lb />
			bring uniformity and certainty of awards made all over the country.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(para 15).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			371. We find that in India, certain non-pecuniary and non-
			<lb />
			tangible concerns are also being taken into consideration while
			<lb />
			determining compensation. This is best illustrated by cases
			<lb />
			involving computation of compensation to family members of a
			<lb />
			deceased housewife i.e. a person with no fixed income/salary. In
			<lb />
			the judgment reported at (2010) 9 SCC 218, Arun Kumar Agrawal
			<lb />
			&amp; Anr. v. National Insurance Co. Ltd. &amp; Ors., the court was
			<lb />
			considering a claim for compensation by husband and a minor
			<lb />
			child of the deceased wife/mother. The court discussed the
			<lb />
			development of the applicable principles in England from award of
			<lb />
			damages solely on the basis of the pecuniary loss to the family due
			<lb />
			to the demise of the wife till the departure from this rule in (1915)
			<lb />
			1 KB 627, Berry v. Humm and Co. wherein the court noted that
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 288
			<lb />
			the pecuniary loss should not be limited to the value of the money
			<lb />
			lost or the money value of the things lost and why should the
			<lb />
			monetary loss incurred by replacing services rendered gratuitously
			<lb />
			by a relative be not considered, if there was a reasonable prospect
			<lb />
			of their being rendered freely in the future but for the death.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			372. In para 24, the following portions were extracted from
			<lb />
			pronouncements in (1976) 1 WLR 305, Regan v. Williamson
			<lb />
			wherein the court was considering the issue relating to quantum of
			<lb />
			compensation payable to the dependants of a woman who was
			<lb />
			killed in the road accident:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-24. xxx xxx xxx
			<lb />

		<item>
			&quot;The weekend care of the plaintiff and the boys remains a
			<lb />
			problem which has not been satisfactorily solved. The
			<lb />
			plaintiff&apos;s relatives help him to a certain extent, especially
			<lb />
			on Saturday afternoons. But I formed the clear
			<lb />
			impression that the plaintiff is often, at weekends, sorely
			<lb />
			tired in trying to be an effective substitute for the
			<lb />
			deceased. The problem could, to some extent, be cured
			<lb />
			by engaging another woman, possibly to do duty at the
			<lb />
			weekend, but finding such a person is no simple matter. I
			<lb />
			think the plaintiff has not made extensive enquiries in
			<lb />
			this regard. Possibly the expense involved in getting
			<lb />
			more help is a factor which has deterred him. Whatever
			<lb />
			be the reason, the plain fact is that the deceased&apos;s services
			<lb />
			at the weekend have not been replaced. They are lost to
			<lb />
			the plaintiff and to the boys.
			<lb />

			<lb />
			-I have been referred to a number of cases in which
			<lb />
			judges have felt compelled to look upon the task of
			<lb />
			assessing damages in cases involving the death of a wife
			<lb />
			and mother with strict disregard to those features of the
			<lb />
			life of a woman beyond her so-called services, that is to
			<lb />
			say, to keep house, to cook the food, to buy the clothes,
			<lb />
			to wash them and so forth. In more than one case, an
			<lb />
			attempt has been made to calculate the actual number of
			<lb />
			hours it would take a woman to perform such services
			<lb />
			and to compensate dependants upon that basis at so much
			<lb />
			an hour and so relegate the wife or mother, so it seems to
			<lb />
			me, to the position of a housekeeper.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			While I think that the law inhibits me from, much as I
			<lb />
			should like to, going all the way along the path to which
			<lb />
			Lord Edmund-Davies pointed, I am, with due respect to
			<lb />
			the other judges to whom I have been referred, of the
			<lb />
			view that the word ‗services&apos; has been too narrowly
			<lb />
			construed. It should, at least, include an acknowledgment
			<lb />
			that a wife and mother does not work to set hours and,
			<lb />
			still less, to rule. She is in constant attendance, save for
			<lb />
			those hours when she is, if that is the fact, at work.
			<lb />
			During some of those hours she may well give the
			<lb />
			children instruction on essential matters to do with their
			<lb />
			upbringing and, possibly, with such things as their
			<lb />
			homework. This sort of attention seems to be as much of
			<lb />
			a service, and probably more valuable to them, than the
			<lb />
			other kinds of service conventionally so regarded.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			373. In para 25, the court cited yet another precedent as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;25. In Mehmet v. Perry [(1977) 2 All ER 529 (DC)] the
			<lb />
			pecuniary value of a wife&apos;s services were assessed and
			<lb />
			granted under the following heads:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(a) Loss to the family of the wife&apos;s housekeeping
			<lb />
			services.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(b) Loss suffered by the children of the personal attention
			<lb />
			of their mother, apart from housekeeping services
			<lb />
			rendered by her.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(c) Loss of the wife&apos;s personal care and attention, which
			<lb />
			the husband had suffered, in addition to the loss of her
			<lb />
			housekeeping services.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			374. So far as the position in India is concerned, we may extract
			<lb />
			the observations of the Supreme Court in paras 26 and 27 of Arun
			<lb />
			Kumar Agrawal which read thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;26. In India the courts have recognised that the
			<lb />
			contribution made by the wife to the house is invaluable
			<lb />
			and cannot be computed in terms of money. The
			<lb />
			gratuitous services rendered by the wife with true love
			<lb />
			and affection to the children and her husband and
			<lb />
			managing the household affairs cannot be equated with
			<lb />
			the services rendered by others. A wife/mother does not
			<lb />
			work by the clock. She is in the constant attendance of
			<lb />
			the family throughout the day and night unless she is
			<lb />
			employed and is required to attend the employer&apos;s work
			<lb />
			for particular hours. She takes care of all the
			<lb />
			requirements of the husband and children including
			<lb />
			cooking of food, washing of clothes, etc. She teaches
			<lb />
			small children and provides invaluable guidance to them
			<lb />
			for their future life. A housekeeper or maidservant can do
			<lb />
			the household work, such as cooking food, washing
			<lb />
			clothes and utensils, keeping the house clean, etc., but
			<lb />
			she can never be a substitute for a wife/mother who
			<lb />
			renders selfless service to her husband and children.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			27. It is not possible to quantify any amount in lieu of the
			<lb />
			services rendered by the wife/mother to the family i.e. the
			<lb />
			husband and children. However, for the purpose of award
			<lb />
			of compensation to the dependants, some pecuniary
			<lb />
			estimate has to be made of the services of the
			<lb />
			housewife/mother. In that context, the term -services‖ is
			<lb />
			required to be given a broad meaning and must be
			<lb />
			construed by taking into account the loss of personal care
			<lb />
			and attention given by the deceased to her children as a
			<lb />
			mother and to her husband as a wife. They are entitled to
			<lb />
			adequate compensation in lieu of the loss of gratuitous
			<lb />
			services rendered by the deceased. The amount payable
			<lb />
			to the dependants cannot be diminished on the ground
			<lb />
			that some close relation like a grandmother may
			<lb />
			volunteer to render some of the services to the family
			<lb />
			which the deceased was giving earlier.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			375. In para 28, the court referred to the pronouncement of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court reported at (2001) 8 SCC 197, Lata Wadhwa v.
			<lb />
			State of Bihar wherein attempt was made to determine the
			<lb />
			compensation on the basis of the multifarious services rendered by
			<lb />
			the deceased housewives to the house, in the absence of any data
			<lb />
			and as the wives were not earning any income. The value of the
			<lb />
			service and the multiplier were varied based on the age of the
			<lb />
			deceased.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			376. The judgment in Lata Wadhwa was referred to with
			<lb />
			approval in (2001) 8 SCC 151, M.S. Grewal v. Deep Chand Sood.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			377. In several judgments, courts have advocated giving a wider
			<lb />
			meaning to the word &quot;services&quot; in cases relating to the award of
			<lb />
			compensation to the dependants of the deceased wife/mother.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			378. We may note that in para 35 of Arun Kumar Agrawal, the
			<lb />
			court observed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;35. xxx xxx xxx it is highly unfair, unjust and
			<lb />
			inappropriate to compute the compensation payable to
			<lb />
			the dependants of a deceased wife/mother, who does not
			<lb />
			have a regular income, by comparing her services with
			<lb />
			that of a housekeeper or a servant or an employee, who
			<lb />
			works for a fixed period. The gratuitous services
			<lb />
			rendered by the wife/mother to the husband and children
			<lb />
			cannot be equated with the services of an employee and
			<lb />
			no evidence or data can possibly be produced for
			<lb />
			estimating the value of such services. It is virtually
			<lb />
			impossible to measure in terms of money the loss of
			<lb />
			personal care and attention suffered by the husband and
			<lb />
			children on the demise of the housewife. In its wisdom,
			<lb />
			the legislature had, as early as in 1994, fixed the notional
			<lb />
			income of a non-earning person at Rs. 15,000 per annum
			<lb />
			and in case of a spouse, 1/3rd income of the
			<lb />
			earning/surviving spouse for the purpose of computing
			<lb />
			the compensation.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			379. In Arun Kumar Agrawal, A.K. Ganguly, J. gave additional
			<lb />
			reasons to the issue. Reference was made to the Division Bench
			<lb />
			pronouncement of the Madras High Court reported at (2009) 6
			<lb />
			MLJ 1005, National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Minor Deepika to the
			<lb />
			following methodology for assessment of the work of a
			<lb />
			homemaker:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;56. The Madras High Court in its very illuminating
			<lb />
			judgment in Deepika [(2009) 6 MLJ 1005] has further
			<lb />
			referred to various methods by which the assessment of
			<lb />
			work of a homemaker can be made and the relevant portion
			<lb />
			from para 10 of the said judgment is extracted below: (MLJ
			<lb />
			p. 1008)
			<lb />
			-10. … that there have been efforts to understand the
			<lb />
			value of a homemaker&apos;s unpaid labour by different
			<lb />
			methods. One is, the opportunity cost which evaluates
			<lb />
			her wages by assessing what she would have earned
			<lb />
			had she not remained at home viz. the opportunity
			<lb />
			lost. The second is, the partnership method which
			<lb />
			assumes that a marriage is an equal economic
			<lb />
			partnership and in this method, the homemaker&apos;s
			<lb />
			salary is valued at half her husband&apos;s salary. Yet
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 293
			<lb />
			another method is to evaluate homemaking by
			<lb />
			determining how much it would cost to replace the
			<lb />
			homemaker with paid workers. This is called the
			<lb />
			Replacement Method.‖
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			57. Various aspects of the nature of a homemaker&apos;s job have
			<lb />
			been described in para 11 which are very relevant and are
			<lb />
			extracted below: (Deepika case [(2009) 6 MLJ 1005] , MLJ
			<lb />
			p. 1008)
			<lb />
			-11. The role of a housewife includes managing
			<lb />
			budgets, coordinating activities, balancing accounts,
			<lb />
			helping children with education, managing help at
			<lb />
			home, nursing care, etc. One formula that has been
			<lb />
			arrived at determines the value of the housewife as,
			<lb />
			value of housewife = husband&apos;s income − wife&apos;s
			<lb />
			income + value of husband&apos;s household services,
			<lb />
			which means the wife&apos;s value will increase inversely
			<lb />
			proportionate to the extent of participation by the
			<lb />
			husband in the household duties. The Australian
			<lb />
			Family Property Law provides that while distributing
			<lb />
			properties in matrimonial matters, for instance, one
			<lb />
			has to factor in ‗the contribution made by a party to
			<lb />
			the marriage to the welfare of the family constituted
			<lb />
			by the parties to the marriage and any children of the
			<lb />
			marriage, including any contribution made in the
			<lb />
			capacity of a homemaker or parent&apos;.‖
			<lb />
			In para 13, the Division Bench of the High Court has
			<lb />
			observed and, in my view very rightly, that time has come to
			<lb />
			scientifically assess the value of the unpaid homemaker both
			<lb />
			in accident claims and in matters of division of matrimonial
			<lb />
			properties.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			380. We now examine another aspect of non-tangible losses
			<lb />
			which result upon a death of a family member. Compensation
			<lb />
			should be just equitable, fair and reasonable with reference to
			<lb />
			settled principles on assessment of damages. In the judgment
			<lb />
			reported at (2013) 9 SCC 54, Rajesh &amp; Ors. v. Rajbir Singh &amp;
			<lb />
			Ors., the court was considering a claim for damages by a widow
			<lb />
			and three minor children of a deceased victim of a fatal road
			<lb />
			accident. Referring to the concept of non-pecuniary damages
			<lb />
			which results on account of a fatal accident including loss of
			<lb />
			consortium to the spouse and loss of love, care and guidance to the
			<lb />
			children, it was held as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;17. xxx xxx xxx In legal parlance, -consortium‖ is the
			<lb />
			right of the spouse to the company, care, help, comfort,
			<lb />
			guidance, society, solace, affection and sexual relations
			<lb />
			with his or her mate. That non-pecuniary head of
			<lb />
			damages has not been properly understood by our courts.
			<lb />
			The loss of companionship, love, care and protection,
			<lb />
			etc., the spouse is entitled to get, has to be compensated
			<lb />
			appropriately. The concept of non-pecuniary damage for
			<lb />
			loss of consortium is one of the major heads of award of
			<lb />
			compensation in other parts of the world more
			<lb />
			particularly in the United States of America, Australia,
			<lb />
			etc. English courts have also recognised the right of a
			<lb />
			spouse to get compensation even during the period of
			<lb />
			temporary disablement. By loss of consortium, the courts
			<lb />
			have made an attempt to compensate the loss of spouse&apos;s
			<lb />
			affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society,
			<lb />
			assistance, protection, care and sexual relations during
			<lb />
			the future years. Unlike the compensation awarded in
			<lb />
			other countries and other jurisdictions, since the legal
			<lb />
			heirs are otherwise adequately compensated for the
			<lb />
			pecuniary loss, it would not be proper to award a major
			<lb />
			amount under this head. Hence, we are of the view that it
			<lb />
			would only be just and reasonable that the courts award
			<lb />
			at least rupees one lakh for loss of consortium.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			381. Again in the pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported
			<lb />
			at (2013) 7 SCC 476, Vimal Kanwar &amp; Ors. v. Kishore Dan &amp;
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 295
			<lb />
			Ors., it was held that amounts as to provident fund, pension and
			<lb />
			life insurance, receivable by a claimant under the M.V. Act by
			<lb />
			reason of the victim&apos;s death do not come within the periphery of the
			<lb />
			M.V. Act and cannot be termed as &quot;pecuniary advantage&quot; liable for
			<lb />
			deduction. Similarly salary receivable by a dependant claimant
			<lb />
			upon compassionate appointment due to a victim&apos;s death would not
			<lb />
			come within the periphery of the M.V. Act to be termed as
			<lb />
			&quot;pecuniary advantage&quot; liable for deduction. In this case as well,
			<lb />
			the court provided for the &quot;loss of consortium and loss of estate by
			<lb />
			providing a conventional sum of Rs.1,00,000/-; loss of love and
			<lb />
			affection for the daughter at Rs.2,00,000/-; loss of love and
			<lb />
			affection for the widow and mother at Rs.1,00,000/-each&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			382. In the judgment reported at (2012) 12 SCC 198, New India
			<lb />
			Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Gopali &amp; Ors., the deceased had eight
			<lb />
			dependants including four sons and one daughter. The court
			<lb />
			minimised the deduction of the amount that such person would be
			<lb />
			spending on himself keeping in view the amount needed on the
			<lb />
			expenditure for his family to arrive at a reasonable figure of
			<lb />
			dependancy.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			383. We may usefully set down the principles laid down on
			<lb />
			quantification of compensation in the decision dated 11 th October,
			<lb />
			2013 in Crl.Rev.P.No. 338/2009, Satya Prakash v. State by one of
			<lb />
			us (J.R.Midha, J.) reported at 203 (2013) DLT 652 wherein it has
			<lb />
			been held as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Quantum of compensation
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			26. Section 357(1)(b) Cr.P.C. empowers the Court to
			<lb />
			award compensation out of the fine to the victim for any
			<lb />
			loss or injury caused by the offence when the
			<lb />
			compensation is, in the opinion of the Court, recoverable
			<lb />
			by such person in Civil Court. Section 357(1)(c) Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
			empowers the Court to award compensation out of the
			<lb />
			fine in death cases where the persons are entitled to
			<lb />
			recover the same under Fatal Accidents Act, 1855.
			<lb />
			Section 357(3) Cr.P.C. empowers the Court to award
			<lb />
			compensation to any person who has suffered loss or
			<lb />
			injury by reason of the act of the accused. Section 357(5)
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. provides that at the time of awarding
			<lb />
			compensation in any subsequent civil suit relating to the
			<lb />
			same matter, the Court shall take into account any sum
			<lb />
			paid or recovered as compensation under this section.
			<lb />
			The effect of these provisions is that the Court has to
			<lb />
			compute the compensation which the victims are entitled
			<lb />
			to claim against the accused under Civil Law. The
			<lb />
			victims of the road accidents are entitled to compensation
			<lb />
			under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and therefore, the
			<lb />
			Court has to take recourse to the principles for
			<lb />
			computation of compensation under the Motor Vehicles
			<lb />
			Act, 1988. The Court is also competent to award interest
			<lb />
			on the compensation.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />

			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			28. The multiplier method is based on the pecuniary loss
			<lb />
			caused to the dependants by the death of the victim of the
			<lb />
			road accident. The dependency of the dependants is
			<lb />
			determined by taking the annual earning of the deceased
			<lb />
			at the time of the accident. Thereafter, effect is given to
			<lb />
			the future prospects of the deceased. After the income of
			<lb />
			the deceased is established, the deduction is made
			<lb />
			towards the personal expenses of the deceased which he
			<lb />
			would have spent on himself. If the deceased was
			<lb />
			unmarried, normally 50% of the income is deducted
			<lb />
			towards his personal expenses. If the deceased was
			<lb />
			married and leaves behind two to three dependents, 1/3rd
			<lb />
			deduction is made; if the deceased has left behind four to
			<lb />
			six family members, deduction of 1/4th of his income is
			<lb />
			made and where the number of dependent family
			<lb />
			members exceeds six, the deduction of 1/5th of the
			<lb />
			income is made. The remaining amount of income after
			<lb />
			deduction of personal expenses is taken to be the loss of
			<lb />
			dependency to the family members which is multiplied
			<lb />
			by 12 to determine the annual loss of dependency. The
			<lb />
			annual loss of dependency of the dependants of the
			<lb />
			deceased is multiplied by the multiplier according to the
			<lb />
			age of the deceased or victim(s) whichever is higher. A
			<lb />
			table of multipliers is given in Schedule-II of the Motor
			<lb />
			Vehicle Act, 1988 but there was some error in the said
			<lb />
			table which has been corrected by the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			Sarla Verma v. DTC, 2009 ACJ 1298.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			29. Before awarding any compensation under Section
			<lb />
			357(3) Cr.P.C., the Court shall consider whether any
			<lb />
			compensation has been received by the victim or his
			<lb />
			family by an award of the Motor Accident Claims
			<lb />
			Tribunal. If the victim(s) / his family have not received
			<lb />
			any compensation by an award of the Motor Accident
			<lb />
			Claims Tribunal, the Court shall, in exercise of its
			<lb />
			jurisdiction under Section 357(3) Cr.P.C., compute the
			<lb />
			compensation to which the victim(s) / his family by
			<lb />
			applying the well settled principles under the Motor
			<lb />
			Vehicles Act, 1988. However, if the victim / his family
			<lb />
			have received adequate compensation by an award of the
			<lb />
			Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, the compensation
			<lb />
			under Section 357(3) Cr.P.C. shall be restricted to a
			<lb />
			reasonable conventional compensation in the facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of each case. For example, in a case where
			<lb />
			the deceased aged 36 years working as a telephone
			<lb />
			operator earning Rs.7,500/-per month dies in a road
			<lb />
			accident leaving behind his widow and two children; first
			<lb />
			step would be to add 50% of the income as future
			<lb />
			prospects and total income for computation of
			<lb />
			compensation would be taken as Rs.11,250/-. Next step
			<lb />
			is to deduct 1/3rd towards the personal expenses which
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 298
			<lb />
			the deceased would have spent on himself and the loss of
			<lb />
			dependency of his family would be Rs.7,500/-per month.
			<lb />
			The annual loss of dependency of Rs.90,000/-is
			<lb />
			multiplied by the multiplier of 15 to compute the total
			<lb />
			loss of dependency as Rs.13,50,000/-. Rs.50,000/-is
			<lb />
			added towards loss of love and affection, loss of
			<lb />
			consortium, loss of estate and funeral expenses. The total
			<lb />
			loss would be Rs.14,00,000/-(Rs.7,500/-plus 50% minus
			<lb />
			1/3rd X 12 X 15 + Rs.50,000/-).&quot;
			<lb />
			It was further held therein that after computation of the
			<lb />
			compensation, the court would be required to consider whether the
			<lb />
			victim had received compensation from the Motor Accidents
			<lb />
			Tribunal.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			384. The development of the law in the context of compensation
			<lb />
			based on the multiplier method in motor accident cases is a useful
			<lb />
			guideline for computation and award of compensation and
			<lb />
			damages.
			<lb />
			Flexibility has been read into the prescribed
			<lb />
			methodology to provide for imponderables and non-pecuniary
			<lb />
			elements of compensation. The same has been effectively utilized
			<lb />
			for award of compensation. Thus, the two components of
			<lb />
			compensation, i.e., standard compensation and compensation for
			<lb />
			pecuniary loss of dependancy would be ascertained based on
			<lb />
			above.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			385. It needs no further elaboration that the object of Section 357
			<lb />
			of the Cr.P.C., whereby the courts are empowered to award
			<lb />
			compensation to victims of the criminal offences in respect of the
			<lb />
			loss or injury suffered or harm caused, is to do justice in a holistic
			<lb />
			and real manner to the victims of crime. We are herein concerned
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 299
			<lb />
			with the award of compensation for loss resulting on account of
			<lb />
			criminal acts committed by defendants after premeditation and
			<lb />
			planning. This fact would necessarily have to be factored into the
			<lb />
			compensation awarded so far as quantification of compensation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			XI. State liability to pay compensation
			<lb />
			The discussion on this subject is being considered under the
			<lb />
			following sub-headings:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Recovery of compensation and whether imposition of a
			<lb />
			default sentence for default in payment of compensation is
			<lb />
			permissible.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) Impact of undergoing default sentence on liability for
			<lb />
			payment of fine/compensation.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii) Whether award of interim compensation is permissible?
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iv) Power to suspend execution of imprisonment for default of
			<lb />
			payment of fine; power to apportion compensation liability
			<lb />
			between multiple defendants, power to grant time and permit
			<lb />
			instalments for payment.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			386. In a case where the offender stands identified and has the
			<lb />
			capacity to pay compensation, there is no difficulty for the court to
			<lb />
			make orders. However, what is to happen if the offender was not
			<lb />
			identified or could not be traced? Or if identified and traced, does
			<lb />
			not have the paying capacity? There may be a case, where the
			<lb />
			police decides not to prosecute. Or the case, for some reason, ends
			<lb />
			in an acquittal. Where would the victim or his dependants stand,
			<lb />
			so far as compensation is concerned?
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 300
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			387. To meet such eventualities, a statutory amendment was
			<lb />
			brought into force with effect from 31 st December, 2009 and the
			<lb />
			following Section 357A was incorporated into the Cr.P.C.:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;357A. Victim compensation scheme. -(1) Every State
			<lb />
			Government in co-ordination with the Central
			<lb />
			Government shall prepare a scheme for providing funds
			<lb />
			for the purpose of compensation to the victim or his
			<lb />
			dependents who have suffered loss or injury as a result of
			<lb />
			the crime and who require rehabilitation.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2) Whenever a recommendation is made by the Court
			<lb />
			for compensation, the District Legal Service Authority or
			<lb />
			the State Legal Service Authority, as the case may be,
			<lb />
			shall decide the quantum of compensation to be awarded
			<lb />
			under the scheme referred to in sub-section (1).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(3) If the trial Court, at the conclusion of the trial, is
			<lb />
			satisfied, that the compensation awarded under section
			<lb />
			357 is not adequate for such rehabilitation, or where the
			<lb />
			cases end in acquittal or discharge and the victim has to
			<lb />
			be rehabilitated, it may make recommendation for
			<lb />
			compensation.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(4) Where the offender is not traced or identified, but the
			<lb />
			victim is identified, and where no trial takes place, the
			<lb />
			victim or his dependents may make an application to the
			<lb />
			State or the District Legal Services Authority for award
			<lb />
			of compensation.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(5) On receipt of such recommendations or on the
			<lb />
			application under sub-section (4), the State or the District
			<lb />
			Legal Services Authority shall, after due enquiry award
			<lb />
			adequate compensation by completing the enquiry within
			<lb />
			two months.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(6) The State or the District Legal Services Authority, as
			<lb />
			the case may be, to alleviate the suffering of the victim,
			<lb />
			may order for immediate first-aid facility or medical
			<lb />
			benefits to be made available free of cost on the
			<lb />
			certificate of the police officer not below the rank of the
			<lb />
			officer in charge of the police station or a Magistrate of
			<lb />
			the area concerned, or any other interim relief as the
			<lb />
			appropriate authority deems fit.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			388. There was, therefore, statutory recognition of the
			<lb />
			responsibility of the State as well to ensure compensation to the
			<lb />
			victim(s) or his dependants who have suffered loss or injury as a
			<lb />
			result of the crime and who require rehabilitation. It is essential to
			<lb />
			emphasise that under sub-section (1) the legislation is not restricted
			<lb />
			to legal heirs or representatives but ensure provision of
			<lb />
			compensation to ‗dependants&apos; of the victim of crime who has
			<lb />
			suffered loss or injury as a result and who require rehabilitation. In
			<lb />
			sub-section (3), the statute has also envisaged situations where
			<lb />
			compensation awarded under Section 357 may not be adequate for
			<lb />
			such rehabilitation (for instance when the paying capacity of the
			<lb />
			offender is insufficient) or when the cases end in acquittal or
			<lb />
			discharge and the victim has to be rehabilitated. In sub-section (4),
			<lb />
			provision is made for a case where the victim stands identified,
			<lb />
			however, the offender is not traced or identified and no trial takes
			<lb />
			place. In such a case the victim or his dependants may make an
			<lb />
			application to the State or the District Legal Services Authority for
			<lb />
			the award of compensation. Time bound compliance has been
			<lb />
			mandated and provision has been made of ensuring first-aid or
			<lb />
			medical benefits as well, to alleviate the suffering of the victim.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			389. While sub-section (3) provides that the trial court would
			<lb />
			make the recommendation for compensation, sub-sections (4), (5)
			<lb />
			and (6) mandate the State or the District Legal Services Authority
			<lb />
			to pass appropriate orders thereunder.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			390. We are informed that so far as Delhi is concerned, the
			<lb />
			Government of NCT of Delhi on 2nd February, 2012 has notified
			<lb />
			the Delhi Victims Compensation Scheme wherein, in case of loss
			<lb />
			of life, a minimum of compensation has been stated at
			<lb />
			Rs.3,00,000/-with the maximum at Rs.5,00,000/-.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			391. Taking a strict view with regard to the failure of State
			<lb />
			governments to adequate provide for victim&apos;s compensation in
			<lb />
			appropriate schemes in compliance with Section 357A of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C., the Supreme Court issued time bound directions in para 14
			<lb />
			of the judgment reported at (2014) SCC Online SC 952, Suresh &amp;
			<lb />
			Anr. v. State of Haryana which reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;14. We are of the view that it is the duty of the Courts,
			<lb />
			on taking cognizance of a criminal offence, to ascertain
			<lb />
			whether there is tangible material to show commission of
			<lb />
			crime, whether the victim is identifiable and whether the
			<lb />
			victim of crime needs immediate financial relief. On
			<lb />
			being satisfied on an application or on its own motion,
			<lb />
			the Court ought to direct grant of interim compensation,
			<lb />
			subject to final compensation being determined later.
			<lb />
			Such duty continues at every stage of a criminal case
			<lb />
			where compensation ought to be given and has not been
			<lb />
			given, irrespective of the application by the victim. At
			<lb />
			the stage of final hearing it is obligatory on the part of
			<lb />
			the Court to advert to the provision and record a finding
			<lb />
			whether a case for grant of compensation has been
			<lb />
			made out and, if so, who is entitled to compensation and
			<lb />
			how much. Award of such compensation can be interim.
			<lb />
			Gravity of offence and need of victim are some of the
			<lb />
			guiding factors to be kept in mind, apart from such
			<lb />
			other factors as may be found relevant in the facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of an individual case. We are also of the
			<lb />
			view that there is need to consider upward revision in the
			<lb />
			scale for compensation and pending such consideration
			<lb />
			to adopt the scale notified by the State of Kerala in its
			<lb />
			scheme, unless the scale awarded by any other State or
			<lb />
			Union Territory is higher. The States of Andhra Pradesh,
			<lb />
			Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya and Telangana are directed
			<lb />
			to notify their schemes within one month from receipt of
			<lb />
			a copy of this order. We also direct that a copy of this
			<lb />
			judgment be forwarded to National Judicial Academy so
			<lb />
			that all judicial officers in the country can be imparted
			<lb />
			requisite training to make the provision operative and
			<lb />
			meaningful.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			392. It is therefore, obligatory on every criminal court to consider
			<lb />
			the case from the perspective of whether an order under Section
			<lb />
			357 Cr.P.C. was called for or not. It is a duty of every court to
			<lb />
			consider the case for grant of interim compensation at every stage
			<lb />
			of criminal case where compensation ought to be given and has not
			<lb />
			been given, without waiting for an application from the victim.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Recovery of compensation and whether imposition of a
			<lb />
			default sentence for default in payment of compensation is
			<lb />
			permissible
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			393. Let us firstly examine the modes statutorily prescribed for
			<lb />
			recovery of fine. In this regard, Section 421 of the Code of
			<lb />
			Criminal Procedure, 1973 provides as follows:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-421. Warrant for levy of fine.-(1) When an offender
			<lb />
			has been sentenced to pay a fine, the Court passing the
			<lb />
			sentence may take action for the recovery of the fine in
			<lb />
			either or both of the following ways, that is to say, it
			<lb />
			may-
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(a) issue a warrant for the levy of the amount by
			<lb />
			attachment and sale of any movable property belonging
			<lb />
			to the offender;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(b) issue a warrant to the Collector of the district,
			<lb />
			authorising him to realise the amount as arrears of land
			<lb />
			revenue from the movable or immovable property, or
			<lb />
			both, of the defaulter:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Provided that, if the sentence directs that in default of
			<lb />
			payment of the fine, the offender shall be imprisoned,
			<lb />
			and if such offender has undergone the whole of such
			<lb />
			imprisonment in default, no Court shall issue such
			<lb />
			warrant unless, for special reasons to be recorded in
			<lb />
			writing, it considers it necessary so to do, or unless it has
			<lb />
			made an order for the payment of expenses or
			<lb />
			compensation out of the fine under section 357.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2) The State Government may make rules regulating the
			<lb />
			manner in which warrants under clause (a) of sub-
			<lb />
			section (1) are to be executed, and for the summary
			<lb />
			determination of any claims made by any person other
			<lb />
			than the offender in respect of any property attached in
			<lb />
			execution of such warrant.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(3) Where the Court issues a warrant to the Collector
			<lb />
			under clause (b) of sub-section (1), the Collector shall
			<lb />
			realise the amount in accordance with the law relating to
			<lb />
			recovery of arrears of land revenue, as if such warrant
			<lb />
			were a certificate issued under such law: Provided that no
			<lb />
			such warrant shall be executed by the arrest or detention
			<lb />
			in prison of the offender.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			394. What can be done if a person commits default of payment of
			<lb />
			fine? The Indian Penal Code statutorily recognises the
			<lb />
			permissibility of directing imprisonment in default of payment of
			<lb />
			fine under Section 64 of the Indian Penal Code which specifically
			<lb />
			provides that the court which sentences an offender, shall be
			<lb />
			competent to direct that in default of payment of fine, the offender
			<lb />
			shall suffer imprisonment for a certain term, in which the
			<lb />
			imprisonment shall be in excess of any other imprisonment to
			<lb />
			which he may have been sentenced or to which he may be liable
			<lb />
			under a commutation of a sentence. So far as the description of
			<lb />
			such imprisonment for the non-payment of fine is concerned,
			<lb />
			discretion is given to the court under Section 66 of the IPC which
			<lb />
			permits the court to impose imprisonment in default of payment of
			<lb />
			fine to be of any description to which the offender might have been
			<lb />
			sentenced for the offence. So far as the limits to imprisonment for
			<lb />
			non-payment of fine are concerned, when imprisonment and fine
			<lb />
			are awardable, the same are provided in Section 65 and when the
			<lb />
			offence is punishable with fine only, Section 67 provides the limits.
			<lb />
			It is noteworthy that under Sections 68 and 69, the legislature has
			<lb />
			anticipated payment of the fine or part of the fine and the
			<lb />
			consequences thereof on the default imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			395. Though the Code of Criminal Procedure does not provide
			<lb />
			specific provision for recovery of the amount of compensation
			<lb />
			under Section 357 of the Cr.P.C., it is necessary to refer to Section
			<lb />
			431 in this regard which reads thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-431. Money ordered to be paid recoverable as a
			<lb />
			fine.-Any money (other than a fine) payable by virtue of
			<lb />
			any order made under this Code, and the method of
			<lb />
			recovery of which is not otherwise expressly provided
			<lb />
			for, shall be recoverable as if it were a fine:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Provided that Section 421 shall, in its application to an
			<lb />
			order under section 359, by virtue of this section, be
			<lb />
			construed as if in the proviso to sub-section (1) of section
			<lb />
			421, after the words and figures -under section 357‖, the
			<lb />
			words and figures -or an order for payment of costs
			<lb />
			under section 359‖ had been inserted.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			396. An order for payment of compensation by the defendant
			<lb />
			upon conviction in a criminal trial is certainly an order under
			<lb />
			Section 357 of the Cr.P.C. and therefore, would be recoverable in
			<lb />
			accordance with the procedure prescribed under Section 431.
			<lb />
			Section 431 adverts to Section 421 of the Cr.P.C. As such, the
			<lb />
			recovery of compensation would be effected in a manner
			<lb />
			prescribed under Section 421 of the Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			397. The statute has provided for imposition of imprisonment
			<lb />
			upon default of payment of a sentence of fine. The question which
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 307
			<lb />
			begs consideration is whether the court has the power to impose a
			<lb />
			similar imprisonment upon default of payment of compensation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			398. This issue is certainly not res integra and stands considered
			<lb />
			by the Supreme Court in several judicial pronouncements. In
			<lb />
			(1994) 4 SCC 29, Balraj v. State of U.P., the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			directed that if the appellant did not pay the amount of
			<lb />
			compensation as ordered, the same may be collected as provided
			<lb />
			under Section 431 of the Cr.P.C. and paid to the victim.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			399. In the pronouncement noted at (1999) 7 SCC 510, K.
			<lb />
			Bhaskaran v. Sankaran Vaidhyan Balan, in para 30, while
			<lb />
			considering Section 357(3) of the Code, the court stated that if the
			<lb />
			&quot;Judicial Magistrate of the First Class were to order compensation
			<lb />
			to be paid to the complainant out of the fine realised, the
			<lb />
			complainant will be the loser when the cheque amount exceeded
			<lb />
			the said limit&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			400. Our attention is drawn to (2002) 2 SCC 420, Suganthi
			<lb />
			Suresh Kumar v. Jagdeeshan, wherein the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			reiterated the law laid down in (1988) 4 SCC 551 Hari Singh v.
			<lb />
			State of U.P. in this regard observing as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-5. In the said decision this Court reminded all concerned
			<lb />
			that it is well to remember the emphasis laid on the need
			<lb />
			for making liberal use of Section 357(3) of the Code.
			<lb />
			This was observed by reference to a decision of this
			<lb />
			Court in Hari Singh v. Sukhbir Singh [(1988) 4 SCC
			<lb />
			551 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 984 : AIR 1988 SC 2127].‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-10. That apart, Section 431 of the Code has only
			<lb />
			prescribed that any money (other than fine) payable by
			<lb />
			virtue of an order made under the Code shall be
			<lb />
			recoverable -as if it were a fine‖. Two modes of
			<lb />
			recovery of the fine have been indicated in Section
			<lb />
			421(1) of the Code. The proviso to the sub-section says
			<lb />
			that if the sentence directs that in default of payment of
			<lb />
			the fine, the offender shall be imprisoned, and if such
			<lb />
			offender has undergone the whole of such imprisonment
			<lb />
			in default, no court shall issue such warrant for levy of
			<lb />
			the amount.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			11. When this Court pronounced in Hari Singh v. Sukhbir
			<lb />
			Singh [(1988) 4 SCC 551 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 984 : AIR
			<lb />
			1988 SC 2127] that a court may enforce an order to pay
			<lb />
			compensation -by imposing a sentence in default‖ it is
			<lb />
			open to all courts in India to follow the said course. The
			<lb />
			said legal position would continue to hold good until it is
			<lb />
			overruled by a larger Bench of this Court. xxx‖.
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			401. Reference requires to be made to an order of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court dated 3 rd August, 2007 in Crl.A.No.1013/2007 which has
			<lb />
			been reported at (2009) 6 SCC 660 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 302,
			<lb />
			Ahammedkutty v. Abdullakoya. The Supreme Court ordered that
			<lb />
			compensation directed to be paid by the court in exercise of its
			<lb />
			jurisdiction under sub-section 3 of Section 357 cannot be realised
			<lb />
			as a fine in terms of Section 421.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			402. In (2009) 6 SCC 652 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 296, Vijayan v.
			<lb />
			Sadanandan K. &amp; Anr., the aforesaid judgment in Ahammedkutty
			<lb />
			was relied upon by the party ordered to pay. However, the court
			<lb />
			noticed the provisions of Sections 421 and 431 CrPC, which dealt
			<lb />
			with mode of recovery of fine and Section 64 IPC, which
			<lb />
			empowered the courts to provide for a sentence of imprisonment
			<lb />
			on default of payment of fine. The court also extensively referred
			<lb />
			to the pronouncements of the Supreme Court and declared that the
			<lb />
			law had been correctly stated in Suganthi. We set down hereunder
			<lb />
			the findings and reiteration of the principles laid down in Hari
			<lb />
			Singh in para 31 and 32 which read as follows :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-31. The provisions of Sections 357(3) and 431 CrPC,
			<lb />
			when read with Section 64 IPC, empower the court,
			<lb />
			while making an order for payment of compensation, to
			<lb />
			also include a default sentence in case of non-payment
			<lb />
			of the same.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			32. The observations made by this Court in Hari Singh
			<lb />
			case [(1988) 4 SCC 551 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 984 : AIR
			<lb />
			1988 SC 2127] are as important today as they were when
			<lb />
			they were made and if, as submitted by Dr. Pillay,
			<lb />
			recourse can only be had to Section 421 CrPC for
			<lb />
			enforcing the same, the very object of sub-section (3) of
			<lb />
			Section 357 would be frustrated and the relief
			<lb />
			contemplated therein would be rendered somewhat
			<lb />

			<lb />
			the judgment reported at (2010) 6 SCC 230, K.A Abbas H.S.A. v.
			<lb />
			Sabu Joseph, on the question of permissibility of awarding a
			<lb />
			sentence of imprisonment upon default of payment of
			<lb />
			compensation observed thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-26. From the above line of cases, it becomes very clear,
			<lb />
			that, a sentence of imprisonment can be granted for
			<lb />
			default in payment of compensation awarded under
			<lb />
			Section 357(3) CrPC. The whole purpose of the
			<lb />
			provision is to accommodate the interests of the victims
			<lb />
			in the criminal justice system. Sometimes the situation
			<lb />
			becomes such that there is no purpose served by keeping
			<lb />
			a person behind bars. Instead directing the accused to
			<lb />
			pay an amount of compensation to the victim or
			<lb />
			affected party can ensure delivery of total justice.
			<lb />
			Therefore, this grant of compensation is sometimes in
			<lb />
			lieu of sending a person behind bars or in addition to a
			<lb />
			very light sentence of imprisonment. Hence on default of
			<lb />
			payment of this compensation, there must be a just
			<lb />
			recourse. Not imposing a sentence of imprisonment
			<lb />
			would mean allowing the accused to get away without
			<lb />
			paying the compensation and imposing another fine
			<lb />
			would be impractical as it would mean imposing a fine
			<lb />
			upon another fine and therefore would not ensure proper
			<lb />
			enforcement of the order of compensation. While passing
			<lb />
			an order under Section 357(3), it is imperative for the
			<lb />
			courts to look at the ability and the capacity of the
			<lb />
			accused to pay the same amount as has been laid down
			<lb />
			by the cases above, otherwise the very purpose of
			<lb />
			granting an order of compensation would stand defeated.

			<lb />
			reliance
			<lb />
			on
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			decision
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			this
			<lb />
			Court
			<lb />
			in Ahammedkutty v. Abdullakoya [(2009) 6 SCC 660 :
			<lb />
			(2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 302] , which reiterated the position
			<lb />
			taken by the Kerala High Court in Radhakrishnan
			<lb />
			Nair v. Padmanabhan [(2000) 2 KLT 349] ; wherein it
			<lb />
			was held that no sentence of imprisonment can be passed
			<lb />
			on default of paying compensation awarded under
			<lb />
			Section 357(3). But in light of several decisions
			<lb />
			reiterating the opposite stand, this case needs to be
			<lb />
			viewed in isolation and cannot be taken to be against the
			<lb />
			established position preferred by the Supreme Court on
			<lb />
			this issue over a period of two decades.‖

			404. In para 29 of the pronouncement reported at (2012) 8 SCC
			<lb />
			721, R. Mohan v. A.K. Vijaya Kumar, the court held as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;29. The idea behind directing the accused to pay
			<lb />
			compensation to the complainant is to give him
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 311
			<lb />
			immediate relief so as to alleviate his grievance. In terms
			<lb />
			of Section 357(3) compensation is awarded for the loss or
			<lb />
			injury suffered by the person due to the act of the accused
			<lb />
			for which he is sentenced. If merely an order directing
			<lb />
			compensation is passed, it would be totally ineffective. It
			<lb />
			could be an order without any deterrence or apprehension
			<lb />
			of immediate adverse consequences in case of its non-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			observance. The whole purpose of giving relief to the
			<lb />
			complainant under Section 357(3) of the Code would be
			<lb />
			frustrated if he is driven to take recourse to Section 421
			<lb />
			of the Code. Order under Section 357(3) must have
			<lb />
			potentiality to secure its observance. Deterrence can only
			<lb />
			be infused into the order by providing for a default
			<lb />
			sentence. If Section 421 of the Code puts compensation
			<lb />
			ordered to be paid by the court on a par with fine so far
			<lb />
			as mode of recovery is concerned, then there is no reason
			<lb />
			why the court cannot impose a sentence in default of
			<lb />
			payment of compensation as it can be done in case of
			<lb />
			default in payment of fine under Section 64 IPC. It is
			<lb />
			obvious that in view of this, in Vijayan [(2009) 6 SCC
			<lb />
			652 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 296] , this Court stated that the
			<lb />
			abovementioned provisions enabled the court to impose a
			<lb />
			sentence in default of payment of compensation and
			<lb />
			rejected the submission that the recourse can only be had
			<lb />
			to Section 421 of the Code for enforcing the order of
			<lb />
			compensation. Pertinently, it was made clear that
			<lb />
			observations made by this Court in Hari Singh [(1988) 4
			<lb />
			SCC 551 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 984] are as important today as
			<lb />
			they were when they were made. The conclusion,
			<lb />
			therefore, is that the order to pay compensation may be
			<lb />
			enforced by awarding sentence in default.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			405. In the recent pronouncement of the Supreme Court dated 6 th
			<lb />
			May, 2014 in W.P.(Crl.)No.57/2014 reported at (2014) 8 SCC 470,
			<lb />
			Subrata Roy Sahara v. Union of India, the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			reiterated the well settled position -under the provisions of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C., there is an elaborate procedure prescribed whereunder a
			<lb />
			person can be subjected to arrest and detention for the
			<lb />
			satisfaction of a fine or compensation (i.e. for the recovery of a
			<lb />
			financial liability)‖.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			406. It is, therefore, well settled that courts are amply empowered
			<lb />
			to direct imprisonment for default of payment of fine or
			<lb />
			compensation. Upon a conjoint reading of Sections 357(3) and 431
			<lb />
			of the Cr.P.C. as well as Section 64 of the Indian Penal Code, it is
			<lb />
			trite that the court making an order under Section 357 of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. can direct that in default of payment of the compensation,
			<lb />
			the offender shall suffer imprisonment, for a term and manner for
			<lb />
			which imprisonment would be imposed for default of payment of a
			<lb />
			fine.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			407. It is important to note that the sentence of imprisonment for
			<lb />
			default in payment of compensation is different from the regular
			<lb />
			sentence of imprisonment imposed as a punishment.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			description of the imprisonment would be in consonance with
			<lb />
			Section 66 of the IPC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			408. For the purposes of determining apt imprisonment for
			<lb />
			default of payment of fine/compensation, while keeping within the
			<lb />
			limits prescribed in Sections 65 and 67 of the IPC, it is therefore,
			<lb />
			the duty of the court to keep in view relevant consideration which
			<lb />
			would again inter alia include the nature of the offence, the
			<lb />
			circumstances in which it was committed, position of the offender.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii) Impact of undergoing default sentence on liability for
			<lb />
			payment of fine/compensation
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			409. Having held that under Section 357 of the Cr.P.C. the court
			<lb />
			can impose a default imprisonment for failure to pay
			<lb />
			compensation, brings us to the next question. What is the impact
			<lb />
			of undergoing the default sentence on the compensation liability?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			410. In the context of execution of an order for payment of
			<lb />
			maintenance under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. as well, the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in its judgment reported at (1989) 1 SCC 405, Kuldeep v.
			<lb />
			Surender Singh has observed that sentencing a person to jail is a
			<lb />
			&quot;mode of enforcement&quot; and not a &quot;mode of satisfaction&quot;. It was
			<lb />
			held as follows:
			<lb />
			-6. A distinction has to be drawn between a mode of
			<lb />
			enforcing recovery on the one hand and effecting actual
			<lb />
			recovery of the amount of monthly allowance which has
			<lb />
			fallen in arrears on the other.
		</p>
		<head>
			Sentencing a person to jail
			<lb />
			is a -mode of enforcement‖. It is not a -mode of
			<lb />
			satisfaction‖ of the liability. The liability can be satisfied
			<lb />
			only by making actual payment of the arrears. The
			<lb />
			whole purpose of sending to jail is to oblige a person
			<lb />
			liable to pay the monthly allowance who refuses to
			<lb />
			comply with the order without sufficient cause, to obey
			<lb />
			the order and to make the payment. The purpose of
			<lb />
			sending him to jail is not to wipe out the liability which
			<lb />
			he has refused to discharge. xxx Sentencing to jail is
			<lb />
			the means for achieving the end of enforcing the order
			<lb />
			by recovering the amount of arrears. It is not a mode of
			<lb />
			discharging liability
		</head>
		<item>
			. The section does not say so.
			<lb />
			Parliament in its wisdom has not said so. Commonsense
			<lb />
			does not support such a construction. From where does
			<lb />
			the court draw inspiration for persuading itself that the
			<lb />
			liability arising under the order for maintenance would
			<lb />
			stand discharged upon an effort being made to recover it?
			<lb />
			The order for monthly allowance can be discharged only
			<lb />
			upon the monthly allowance being recovered. The
			<lb />
			liability cannot be taken to have been discharged by
			<lb />
			sending the person liable to pay the monthly allowance,
			<lb />
			to jail. At the cost of repetition it may be stated that it is
			<lb />
			only a mode or method of recovery and not a substitute
			<lb />
			for recovery. No other view is possible. xxx xxx xxx‖
			<lb />

		<p>
			411. So far as the working and recovery of compensation is
			<lb />
			concerned, in (1998) 7 SCC 392 State of Gujarat v. Hon&apos;ble High
			<lb />
			Court of Gujarat on the experience of a default sentence, it was
			<lb />
			noted as follows:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;48. Section 357 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973
			<lb />
			provides some reliefs to the victims as the court is
			<lb />
			empowered to direct payment of compensation to any
			<lb />
			person for any loss or injury caused by the offence. But
			<lb />
			in practice, the said provision has not proved to be of
			<lb />
			much effectiveness. Many persons who are sentenced to
			<lb />
			long-term imprisonment do not pay the compensation
			<lb />
			and instead they choose to continue in jail in default
			<lb />
			thereof. It is only when fine alone is the sentence that the
			<lb />
			convicts invariably choose to remit the fine. But those
			<lb />
			are cases in which the harm inflicted on the victims
			<lb />
			would have been far less serious. Thus the restorative and
			<lb />
			reparative theories are not translated into real benefits to
			<lb />
			the victims.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			412. It is evident, therefore, that too heavy a compensation
			<lb />
			amount and too trivial the default imprisonment would negate the
			<lb />
			efficacy of not only the compensation, but also of the length of
			<lb />
			default imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			413. So what are the factors which must weigh with the court
			<lb />
			while undertaking such assessment. This is best stated by the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in its pronouncement reported at (2007) 11 SCC
			<lb />
			243, Shantilal v. State of M.P. wherein the court delved into the
			<lb />
			factors which must weigh with the court before ordering a default
			<lb />
			sentence for non-compliance of an order of payment of
			<lb />
			compensation in the following terms:
			<lb />
			-31. ... The
		</p>
		<head>
			term of imprisonment in default of payment
			<lb />
			of fine is not a sentence
		</head>
		<item>
			. It is a penalty which a person
			<lb />
			incurs on account of non-payment of fine. The sentence
			<lb />
			is something which an offender must undergo unless it is
			<lb />
			set aside or remitted in part or in whole either in appeal
			<lb />
			or in revision or in other appropriate judicial proceedings
			<lb />
			or -otherwise‖. A term of imprisonment ordered in
			<lb />
			default of payment of fine stands on a different footing. A
			<lb />
			person is required to undergo imprisonment either
			<lb />
			because he is unable to pay the amount of fine or
			<lb />
			refuses to pay such amount. He, therefore, can always
			<lb />
			avoid to undergo imprisonment in default of payment of
			<lb />
			fine by paying such amount. It is, therefore, not only
			<lb />
			the power, but the duty of the court to keep in view the
			<lb />
			nature of offence, circumstances under which it was
			<lb />
			committed, the position of the offender and other relevant
			<lb />
			considerations before ordering the offender to suffer
			<lb />
			imprisonment in default of payment of fine.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			414. The default sentence is a method of procuring enforcement
			<lb />
			of the order and not a method for discharge of liability.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			415. Undergoing the default sentence would not discharge the
			<lb />
			liability to pay the compensation ordered by the court.

			(iii) Whether award of interim compensation is permissible?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			416. The jurisprudence on the subject of compensation brings out
			<lb />
			the aspect of grant of interim compensation as well. We find that
			<lb />
			in para 18 of (1996) 1 SCC 490, Bodhisattwa Gautam v. Subhra
			<lb />
			Chakraborty (Ms.), the court referred to the prior decision in
			<lb />
			(1995) 1 SCC 14, Delhi Domestic Working Women&apos;s Forum v.
			<lb />
			Union of India wherein the court had laid down the principles for
			<lb />
			trying cases of sexual assault and made directions with regard to
			<lb />
			payment of compensation to victims. In para 18, the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court observed that &quot;if the court trying an offence of rape has
			<lb />
			jurisdiction to award the compensation at the final stage, there is
			<lb />
			no reason to deny to the court the right to award interim
			<lb />
			compensation which should also be provided in the scheme. On the
			<lb />
			basis of principles set out in the aforesaid decision, the jurisdiction
			<lb />
			to pay interim compensation shall be treated to be part of the
			<lb />
			overall jurisdiction of the courts trying the offences of rape which,
			<lb />
			as pointed out above is an offence against basic human rights as
			<lb />
			also the Fundamental Right of Personal Liberty and Life&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			417. In para 19, the court additionally observed that it had &quot;the
			<lb />
			inherent jurisdiction to pass any order it considers fit and proper
			<lb />
			in the interest of justice or to do complete justice between the
			<lb />
			parties&quot;. The jurisdiction to pass such interim order would be
			<lb />
			inherent in the High Courts as well if the facts of the case so
			<lb />
			warrant.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			418. We see no reason as to why the above principles on award of
			<lb />
			interim compensation ought not to apply to the every criminal case,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 317
			<lb />
			including the present case. The High Court in appellate and
			<lb />
			revisional jurisdiction, has the substantive power to award
			<lb />
			compensation under Section 357 of the Cr.P.C. It would therefore,
			<lb />
			have the power to grant interim compensation in exercise of its
			<lb />
			inherent power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			419. This issue in the context of a case involving the offences of
			<lb />
			criminal conspiracy, kidnapping for ransom and murder was
			<lb />
			considered by the Supreme Court in the judgment reported at
			<lb />
			(2014) SCC Online SC 952, Suresh &amp; Anr. v. State of Haryana.
			<lb />
			The court considered the pronouncement in (1985) 4 SCC 337,
			<lb />
			Savitri v. Govind Singh Rawat wherein the court held that it was a
			<lb />
			duty of the court to interpret the provisions of Chapter IX of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. (in the context of Section 125) in such a way that the
			<lb />
			construction placed on them would not defeat the very object of the
			<lb />
			legislation. It was held that in the absence of any express
			<lb />
			prohibition, it was appropriate to construe the provisions as
			<lb />
			conferring an implied power on the Magistrates to direct the person
			<lb />
			against whom the application under Section 125 is made, to pay
			<lb />
			some reasonable sum by way of interim maintenance to the
			<lb />
			applicant. This view was reiterated by the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			(2008) 9 SCC 632, Shail Kumari Devi v. Krishan Bhagwan
			<lb />
			Pathak.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			420. So far as the issue of interim compensation to victims of
			<lb />
			crime was concerned, in Suresh v. State of Haryana, the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court held as follows:
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 318
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;We are of the view that above observations support the
			<lb />
			submission that interim compensation ought to be paid at
			<lb />
			the earliest so that immediate need of victim can be met.
			<lb />
			For determining the amount of interim compensation, the
			<lb />
			Court may have regard to the facts and circumstances of
			<lb />
			individual cases including the nature of offence, loss
			<lb />
			suffered and the requirement of the victim. On an interim
			<lb />
			order being passed by the Court, the funds available with
			<lb />
			the District/State Legal Services Authorities may be
			<lb />
			disbursed to the victims in the manner directed by the
			<lb />
			Court, to be adjusted later in appropriate proceedings. If
			<lb />
			the funds already allotted get exhausted, the State may
			<lb />
			place further funds at the disposal of the Legal Services
			<lb />
			Authorities.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			421. It is therefore, well settled that the courts are adequately
			<lb />
			empowered to consider award of interim compensation to a victim
			<lb />
			of a criminal offence upon the court concluding in favour of the
			<lb />
			entitlement of a person. A direction to make the payment of the
			<lb />
			interim maintenance can be made against the Legal Services
			<lb />
			Authority
			<lb />
			subject
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			appropriate
			<lb />
			orders
			<lb />
			for
			<lb />
			adjustment/reimbursement, if deemed appropriate upon final
			<lb />
			adjudication.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iv) Power to suspend execution of imprisonment for default of
			<lb />
			payment of fine; power to apportion compensation liability
			<lb />
			between multiple defendants, power to grant time and permit
			<lb />
			instalments for payment.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			422. It is essential to refer to a statutory provision which confers
			<lb />
			the power of suspension of execution of the sentence of
			<lb />
			imprisonment in default of payment of the fine, either
			<lb />
			unconditionally or on conditions. In this regard, we set down
			<lb />
			hereunder Section 424 of the Cr.P.C. which reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-424. Suspension of execution of sentence of
			<lb />
			imprisonments. -(1) When an offender has been
			<lb />
			sentenced to fine only and to imprisonment in default of
			<lb />
			payment of the fine and the fine is not paid forthwith, the
			<lb />
			court may-
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(a) Order that the fine shall be payable either in fully on
			<lb />
			or before a date not more than thirty days from the date
			<lb />
			of the order, or in two or three instalments, of which the
			<lb />
			first shall be payable on or before a date not more than
			<lb />
			thirty days from the date of the order and the other or
			<lb />
			others at an interval or at intervals, as the case may be, of
			<lb />
			not more than thirty days;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(b) Suspend the execution of the sentence of
			<lb />
			imprisonment and release the offender, on the execution
			<lb />
			by the offender of a bond, with or without sureties, as the
			<lb />
			court thinks fit, on conditioned for his appearance before
			<lb />
			the court on the date or dates on or before which payment
			<lb />
			of the fine or the instalment thereof, as the case may be,
			<lb />
			is to be made; and if the amount of the fine or of any
			<lb />
			instalment, as the case may be, is not realised on or
			<lb />
			before the latest date on which it is payable under the
			<lb />
			order, the court may direct the sentence of imprisonment
			<lb />
			to be carried into execution at once.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall be applicable
			<lb />
			also in any case in which an order for the payment of
			<lb />
			money has been made on non-recovery of which
			<lb />
			imprisonment may be awarded and the money is not paid
			<lb />
			forthwith; and, if the person against whom the order has
			<lb />
			been made, on being required to enter into a bond such as
			<lb />
			is referred to in that sub-section, fails to do so, the court
			<lb />
			may at once pass sentence of imprisonment.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Therefore, even while passing an order suspending the
			<lb />
			sentence of imprisonment for default of payment, it is open to the
			<lb />
			court to grant time to the defendant to pay the amount or do so in
			<lb />
			instalments. The legislative intent is clearly to persuade the
			<lb />
			defendant to comply with the direction to pay.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			423. The issues regarding apportionment between multiple
			<lb />
			convicts, permissibility of payment of differential compensation
			<lb />
			amongst multiple convicts as well as grant of reasonable time to
			<lb />
			the convict and mode for payment stand considered in (1988) 4
			<lb />
			SCC 551 Hari Singh v. Sukhbir Singh, when the Court stated
			<lb />
			thus:
			<lb />
			-11. xxx The quantum of compensation may be
			<lb />
			determined by taking into account the nature of crime,
			<lb />
			the justness of claim by the victim and the ability of
			<lb />
			accused to pay. If there are more than one accused they
			<lb />
			may be asked to pay in equal terms unless their capacity
			<lb />
			to pay varies considerably. The payment may also vary
			<lb />
			depending upon the acts of each accused. Reasonable
			<lb />
			period for payment of compensation, if necessary by
			<lb />
			instalments, may also be given. The court may enforce
			<lb />
			the order by imposing sentence in default.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
			Orders in respect of apportionment between defendants thus
			<lb />
			are permissible and could be considered by the court when passing
			<lb />
			the order of compensation. This would rest on factors as the acts
			<lb />
			of each of the accused, capacity to pay and such like relevant
			<lb />
			factors. So far as grant of a period or instalments for payment are
			<lb />
			concerned, the convict would be required to place material in
			<lb />
			support of such request. Even while suspending a sentence of
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 321
			<lb />
			imprisonment for default of payment, the court is empowered to
			<lb />
			impose conditions in terms of Section 424 of the Cr.P.C., giving
			<lb />
			opportunity to the defendant to pay the amount.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			424. The manner in which the court shall proceed under Section
			<lb />
			357 of the Cr.P.C. is well settled. We hereunder sum up the
			<lb />
			procedure to be followed:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Once a judgment of conviction is returned, or upheld, it is
			<lb />
			the mandatory duty of every court to consider whether the case is a
			<lb />
			fit case for award of compensation.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) The court shall first decide as to what should be the quantum
			<lb />
			of compensation to which the victims or the dependants would be
			<lb />
			entitled in law and then ascertain the paying capacity of the
			<lb />
			defendants.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii) The court is required to conduct an inquiry even a summary
			<lb />
			one with into all relevant factors including the paying capacity of
			<lb />
			the accused. However, such inquiry may not be necessary, if the
			<lb />
			facts emerging during the trial or otherwise are clear rendering the
			<lb />
			inquiry unnecessary.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iv) In fixing the fine and/or compensation, it is the duty of the
			<lb />
			court to take into consideration all relevant factors inter alia
			<lb />
			including the nature of the crime, the injury suffered, the persons
			<lb />
			entitled to be compensated, the justness of the claim for
			<lb />
			compensation, the capacity of the accused to pay.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(v) The enquiry ought to examine the details of the
			<lb />
			victims/dependants, impact of the crime on them as well as their
			<lb />
			circumstances.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(vi) The judge awarding the compensation must exercise the
			<lb />
			power reasonably. He cannot exercise the power to do so
			<lb />
			arbitrarily. It is necessary to assign some reasons for the award of
			<lb />
			fine and compensation by the court.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(vii) Under no circumstance can the fine or compensation be
			<lb />
			either irrational or exorbitant.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(viii) If there are multiple offenders, the compensation would be
			<lb />
			required to be rationally distributed between them. It is also
			<lb />
			permissible to grant time or to direct payment of the compensation
			<lb />
			in instalments keeping in view the paying capacity of the
			<lb />
			defendant.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ix) If recovery of the compensation or any part thereof is not
			<lb />
			possible from the offender, the court shall proceed to cause the
			<lb />
			same to be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 357A
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. and any scheme thereunder.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(x) A summary inquiry is essential to determine the
			<lb />
			compensation under Section 357 unless the facts as emerging in the
			<lb />
			course of trial are so clear that the Court considers it unnecessary
			<lb />
			to do so. Some relevant facts/documents could be collected in this
			<lb />

		</p>
		<p>
			(xi) It shall be ensured by the court that during the inquiry, no
			<lb />
			privilege or right constitutionally or statutorily available to the
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			XII. Fine and compensation -constituents, reasonability and
			<lb />
			adequacy
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			425. Section 357 of the Cr.P.C. confers the power on the courts to
			<lb />
			impose fine and compensation. The legislation does not enumerate
			<lb />
			the factors which ought to weigh with the court while assessing
			<lb />
			appropriate reasonable compensation. There is also very scanty
			<lb />
			jurisprudence on this aspect. It encompasses expenses properly
			<lb />
			incurred in prosecution [clause (a)] as well as such payment to any
			<lb />
			person so as to compensate for any loss or injury caused, when
			<lb />
			compensation is in the opinion of the court recoverable by such
			<lb />
			person in a civil court (clause b).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			426. Fine is a part of sentence imposed, an award of
			<lb />
			compensation is in addition thereto. We have noted above the
			<lb />
			power of the High Court, either on appeal or in revision or also to
			<lb />
			suo motu enhance the sentence if convinced that the same is not
			<lb />
			adequate in the facts and circumstances of the case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			427. In the present case, Sections 302, 364 and 201 of the IPC do
			<lb />
			not limit the quantum of fine which the sentencing court may
			<lb />
			impose.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			428. In Chapter XXVII captioned &quot;The Judgment&quot; of the CrPC,
			<lb />
			the legislature has provided Section 357 which empowers the court
			<lb />
			to make orders of compensation. Some indication as to what must
			<lb />
			be considered by the court while imposing a fine is to be found in
			<lb />
			sub-section (1) Section 357 of the Cr.P.C. which enables the court
			<lb />
			to pass orders for the purposes of which fine (as part of the
			<lb />
			sentence) may be applied.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 327
			<lb />
			429. Clause (a) sub-section (1) of Section 357 permits the courts
			<lb />
			to direct the fine, or part thereof to be applied for -defraying the
			<lb />
			expenses properly incurred in prosecution‖.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			430. Clause (b) enables the court to apply the fine for payment to
			<lb />
			&quot;any person&quot; within courts of &quot;compensation&quot; for &quot;any loss or
			<lb />
			injury caused by the offence&quot; when compensation is in the opinion
			<lb />
			of the court, recoverable by such person in a civil court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			431. We find that so far as civil proceedings are concerned, the
			<lb />
			legislature and judicial precedents have provided for recovery of
			<lb />
			costs of proceedings. The CPC confers discretion on the court to
			<lb />
			determine by whom, out of which property and to what extent costs
			<lb />
			are to be paid as well as to give all necessary directions for the
			<lb />
			purposes. Under Section 35A, the court is enabled to make an order
			<lb />
			for payment of costs by way of compensation in respect of false or
			<lb />
			vexatious claims or defences. The courts are empowered to direct
			<lb />
			that the costs shall form part of the decree.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			432. So far as Code of Criminal Procedure is concerned, it makes
			<lb />
			reference to costs in Section 359 Cr.P.C. which enables the
			<lb />
			convicting court to order accused to pay to complainant -in whole
			<lb />
			or in part, the cost incurred by him in the prosecution‖. It also
			<lb />
			states that -such costs may include any expenses incurred in
			<lb />
			respect of process-fees, witnesses and pleader&quot;s fees which the
			<lb />
			Court may consider reasonable‖.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			433. Some guidance in this regard is discernible from the
			<lb />
			statutory provisions in other countries and jurisprudence therefrom.
			<lb />
			We find legislation in this regard in the United Kingdom as well as
			<lb />
			New Zealand. The Prosecution of Offences Act, 1985 of the
			<lb />
			United Kingdom includes in Part II, &quot;Costs in Criminal Cases&quot;.
			<lb />
			The legislation grades costs as per the hierarchy of courts starting
			<lb />
			from the Magistrates&apos; Court, the Crown Court and the higher
			<lb />
			courts. Apart from costs which may be awarded in favour of the
			<lb />
			accused (referred to as the &apos;defendant&apos;), in Section 17, prosecution
			<lb />
			costs, with regard to proceedings in respect of indictable as well as
			<lb />
			proceedings before the Divisional Court of the Queens Bench
			<lb />
			Division or the Supreme Court. Under Section 18, the award of
			<lb />
			costs against the accused to be paid to the prosecutor as are
			<lb />
			considered &quot;just and reasonable&quot;.
			<lb />
			If in the particular
			<lb />
			circumstances of the case, the court considers it right to do so,
			<lb />
			certain statutory restrictions on the quantum, person to whom, and
			<lb />
			manner of award are also statutorily prescribed. Under sub-section
			<lb />
			4 of Section 18, a Magistrate&apos;s court shall not order the accused to
			<lb />
			pay any cost &quot;unless in the particular circumstances of the case it
			<lb />
			considers it right to do so&quot;. There is also a limitation on costs
			<lb />
			which a person under the age of 18 years can be ordered to pay.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			434. Sub-section 3 of Section 19 enables the Lord Chancellor to
			<lb />
			make regulations to inter alia (a) compensate any witness and any
			<lb />
			other person who necessarily attends for the purposes of the
			<lb />
			proceedings otherwise and (b) to give evidence for the &quot;expense,
			<lb />
			trouble or loss of time&quot; properly incurred in or incidental to his
			<lb />
			attendance.
			<lb />
			Additionally, the regulations would cover the proper
			<lb />
			expenses for an interpreter who may be required; compensate a
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 329
			<lb />
			duly qualified practitioner, who makes a report with regard to a
			<lb />
			medical examination, for the expenses properly incurred in or
			<lb />
			incidental to his reporting to the court. The legislation is farsighted
			<lb />
			in and even provides the cost for the defence; against legal
			<lb />
			representatives; against third parties amongst other matters.
			<lb />
			435. Pursuant to the statutory requirement, the Criminal Cases
			<lb />
			(General) Regulations, 1986 made as a result of the above
			<lb />
			statutory power, came into operation on the 1st of October, 1986.
			<lb />
			Regulation 3 enables the court to order that all or part of the costs
			<lb />
			incurred in respect of proceedings by one of the parties as a result
			<lb />
			of an &quot;unnecessary or improper omission by or on behalf of
			<lb />
			another party to the proceedings&quot; be paid to him by the other
			<lb />
			party.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			436. The regulations provide for the method of determination of
			<lb />
			costs as well as its payment. The regulations provide a
			<lb />
			requirement of an application for a cost order.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			437. The Costs in Criminal Cases Act (Northern Ireland), 1968
			<lb />
			is restricted to the recovery of &quot;expenses of prosecution&quot; in
			<lb />
			Section 1.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			438. Reference may usefully be made to the Costs in Criminal
			<lb />
			Cases Act, 1967 in force in New Zealand. The enactment defines
			<lb />
			the &apos;defendant&apos; as &quot;any person charged with an offence&quot;. Under
			<lb />
			Section 4, where the defendant stands convicted by any court of
			<lb />
			any offence, the court is empowered to order him to pay such sum
			<lb />
			as it thinks &quot;just and reasonable towards the cost of the
			<lb />
			prosecution&quot;. The costs which are allowed are required to be
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 330
			<lb />
			specified in the conviction and may be &quot;recovered in the same
			<lb />
			manner as a fine&quot;. Where the prosecution involved a difficult or
			<lb />
			important point of law, this legislation also provides for payment of
			<lb />
			defendant&apos;s costs, even if convicted, Under Section 10, an order to
			<lb />
			pay costs on appeal is enforceable as if were a fine by the District
			<lb />
			Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			439. Section 12 of the New Zealand law makes it mandatory for
			<lb />
			the court, before deciding whether to award costs under the Act, to
			<lb />
			allow any party, who wishes to make submissions or call evidence
			<lb />
			on the question of costs, reasonable opportunity to do so. So far as
			<lb />
			the heads of costs that may be ordered to be paid under the
			<lb />
			enactment; prescription of maximum scale of costs that may be
			<lb />
			ordered, etc. under Section 13 of the statute, the same are to be
			<lb />
			prescribed by regulations. Under sub-section (3) of Section 13,
			<lb />
			even if a maximum scale of costs stands prescribed by regulation,
			<lb />
			the court is empowered to make an order for payment of costs in
			<lb />
			excess thereof, if it is satisfied that having regard to the &quot;special
			<lb />
			difficulty, complexity, or importance of the case, the payment of
			<lb />
			greater costs is desirable&quot;.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			440. The experience in the United Kingdom has shown that it is
			<lb />
			impractical to maintain detailed time and costs records and that in
			<lb />
			any event, the defendant is generally only asked to make a
			<lb />
			contribution to costs. The tables which have been provided are for
			<lb />
			the purposes of rendering assistance in calculating the staff costs
			<lb />
			incurred at different levels of proceedings, called &quot;Scales of Costs&quot;
			<lb />
			and the advocacy costs at different levels of proceedings.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			441. It was held by the England and Wales Court of Appeals in
			<lb />
			the judgment in (2012) EWCA Crim 2029, R v Kesteven that the
			<lb />
			purpose of the costs ordered is to compensate the prosecutor, and
			<lb />
			not to punish the defendant. The costs should not be grossly
			<lb />
			disproportionate to the fine. Though the judgment of the court
			<lb />
			does not make a reference to costs, but the purpose of the order
			<lb />
			appears to have been compensation for the system for delayed
			<lb />
			compounding.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			442. Have costs been contemplated under the criminal justice
			<lb />
			system in India? We find that in a case under Section 138 of the
			<lb />
			Negotiable Instruments Act, the Supreme Court of India in the
			<lb />
			order dated 3rd May, 2010 disposing of Criminal Appeal
			<lb />
			No.963/2010 [arising out of SLP(Crl.)No.6369/2007], Damodar S.
			<lb />
			Prabhu v. Sayed Babalal H. with Criminal Appeal Nos.964-
			<lb />
			966/2010 [arising out of SLP(Crl.)Nos.6370-6372/2007], observed
			<lb />
			that the law permitted compounding of an offence. However,
			<lb />
			parties were choosing compounding as a matter of last resort
			<lb />
			instead of opting for it as soon as Magistrates take cognizance of
			<lb />
			complaints. Often parties wait till the matter reaches the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in appeal before the defendants accept liability and settles
			<lb />
			the matter with the complainant. Given this reality of defendants
			<lb />
			avoiding their liability to pay, the Supreme Court inter alia
			<lb />
			proposed the following Guidelines for dealing with such cases:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			21. With regard to the progression of litigation in
			<lb />
			cheque bouncing cases, the learned Attorney General has
			<lb />
			urged this Court to frame guidelines for a graded scheme
			<lb />
			of imposing costs on parties who unduly delay
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 332
			<lb />
			compounding of the offence. It was submitted that the
			<lb />
			requirement of deposit of the costs will act as a deterrent
			<lb />
			for delayed composition, since at present, free and easy
			<lb />
			compounding of offences at any stage, however belated,
			<lb />
			gives an incentive to the drawer of the cheque to delay
			<lb />
			settling the cases for years. An application for
			<lb />
			compounding made after several years not only results in
			<lb />
			the system being burdened but the complainant is also
			<lb />
			deprived of effective justice. In view of this submission,
			<lb />
			we direct that the following guidelines be followed:
			<lb />
			THE GUIDELINES
			<lb />
			(i) In the circumstances, it is proposed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(a) That directions can be given that the writ of summons
			<lb />
			be suitably modified making it clear to the accused that
			<lb />
			he could make an application for compounding of the
			<lb />
			offences at the first or second hearing of the case and
			<lb />
			that if such an application is made, compounding may be
			<lb />
			allowed by the court without imposing any costs on the
			<lb />
			accused.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(b) If the accused does not make an application for
			<lb />
			compounding as aforesaid, then if an application for
			<lb />
			compounding is made before the Magistrate at a
			<lb />
			subsequent stage, compounding can be allowed subject
			<lb />
			to the condition that the accused will be required to pay
			<lb />
			10% of the cheque amount to be deposited as a
			<lb />
			condition for compounding with the Legal Services
			<lb />
			Authority, or such authority as the court deems fit.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(c) Similarly, if the application for compounding is made
			<lb />
			before the Sessions Court or a High Court in revision or
			<lb />
			appeal, such compounding may be allowed on the
			<lb />
			condition that the accused pays 15% of the cheque
			<lb />
			amount by way of costs.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(d) Finally, if the application for compounding is made
			<lb />
			before the Supreme Court, the figure would increase to
			<lb />
			20% of the cheque amount.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			443. We find that costs were also imposed by the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			in the judgment reported at AIR 2014 SC (Criminal) 879: 2014
			<lb />
			Cri. L.J. 1575, Padmalayan &amp; Anr. Sarasan Anr. wherein the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court permitted compounding of offences under Section
			<lb />
			324 of the IPC. However, for wasting the time of the courts below
			<lb />
			and the Supreme Court, the costs of Rs.15,000/-was imposed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			444. In the judgment involving a crime of personal gain preceded
			<lb />
			by calculated design, in the case reported at 2012 SCC Online Del
			<lb />
			3298, Trinity Global Enterprises Ltd. v. Raj Hiremath &amp; Anr., the
			<lb />
			consideration by the court of the necessity of conditions on bail and
			<lb />
			the impact of those conditions, throws some light on what may be
			<lb />
			examined while imposing a sentence. This court held thus:
			<lb />
			-23. The petitioner, therefore, continues to enjoy the
			<lb />
			fruits of their crime. Such persons who continue to reap
			<lb />
			the benefit of their crime after committing the offence of
			<lb />
			personal gain and preceded by calculated design need to
			<lb />
			be put under some restriction by imposing a reasonable
			<lb />
			condition so that it does not send a wrong message to
			<lb />
			the potential offenders that even after committing the
			<lb />
			crime, they can continue to enjoy the ill-gotten wealth.
			<lb />
			The Court may impose conditions as specified under
			<lb />
			Section 438(2) CrPC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			24. This Court is conscious of the fact that criminal
			<lb />
			Court is not a recovery forum but in the given case, it is
			<lb />
			the duty of the Court to safeguard the interest of the
			<lb />
			society as also of the complainant who has been duped
			<lb />
			of huge amount. If some reasonable condition is
			<lb />
			imposed on the respondent while letting them enjoy the
			<lb />
			benefit of anticipatory bail, it would have the effect of
			<lb />
			avoiding unnecessary adjournment and delay in trial at
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 334
			<lb />
			the behest of respondents who are accused in FIR No.
			<lb />
			158/2011, PS EOW.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
			Therefore, even so far as the criminal proceedings are
			<lb />
			concerned, imposition of costs either for wasting judicial time
			<lb />
			wasting or compensating the other side is unique neither nor
			<lb />
			restricted to civil proceedings. It is certainly not a new concept.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			445. Though the present case is not concerned with dishonouring
			<lb />
			of the cheque, or an economic offence, however, the object of
			<lb />
			imposition and method of computation of costs in criminal
			<lb />
			proceedings or &quot;expenses incurred in prosecution&quot; even in exercise
			<lb />
			of power under Section 357(1)(a) of the Cr.P.C. cannot differ.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			446. Let us first and foremost examine clause (a) of Section
			<lb />
			357(1) of the Cr.P.C. Other than mentioning the expression -in
			<lb />
			defraying the expenses properly incurred in the prosecution‖, the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. is silent on its composition.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			447. The expressions &quot;defraying&quot;, &quot;expenses&quot;, &quot;properly
			<lb />
			incurred&quot;, &quot;prosecution&quot; in clause (a) or &quot;any person&quot; in clause
			<lb />
			&quot;(b)&quot; have not been defined by the legislature.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			448. So far as the expression &apos;defray&apos; is concerned, no statutory
			<lb />
			definition is available. Other than its use in Section 357(1)(a) of
			<lb />
			the Criminal Procedure Code, it has also been used in Rule 2(1) of
			<lb />
			Order XVI of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 in the context of
			<lb />
			expenses of witnesses to be paid into court or applying for
			<lb />
			summons. This expression is also used in Section 2(22)(e) of the
			<lb />
			Employees State Insurance Act. In the Code of Civil Procedure,
			<lb />
			this statutory provision refers to an amount &apos;as appear to the court
			<lb />
			to be sufficient to defray the travelling and other expenses............&apos;.
			<lb />
			The Legal Glossary, 1988 of the Government of India describes the
			<lb />
			expression &quot;defray&quot; as &quot;to meet the expenses to pay out the
			<lb />
			expenses&quot;. The Oxford English Dictionary Vol. III has also defines
			<lb />
			&apos;defray&apos; as follows :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;1. To pay out, expend, spend, disburse (money).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			2.
			<lb />
			To discharge (the expense or cost of anything) by
			<lb />
			paying; to pay, meet, settle.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			3.
			<lb />
			To meet the expense of; to bear the charge of; pay for.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			4.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			To pay the charges or expenses of (a person); to
			<lb />
			reimburse.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			449. It is therefore obvious that &apos;defray&apos; as appears in Section 357
			<lb />
			has to relate to discharge of all expenses in the prosecution and is
			<lb />
			intended to be an amount equivalent to meeting the expenses
			<lb />
			incurred in the prosecution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			450. It is important to note another important facet of the drafting
			<lb />
			of the statutory provision in India. Unlike the legislations noted by
			<lb />
			us above as well as the orders of the Supreme Court, we find that
			<lb />
			clause(a) of sub-section (1) of Section 357 has utilized the
			<lb />
			expression &quot;expenses&quot; instead of only costs. Expenses relate to
			<lb />
			value of all things utilised in doing particular thing which would be
			<lb />
			beyond simply the actual monetary expenditure. For instance, as
			<lb />
			per the Oxford English Dictionary, it would include the money
			<lb />
			paid for meals, fares, etc. by an employee in the course of their
			<lb />
			work, which they can claim back from the employer. The Black&apos;s
			<lb />
			Law Dictionary defines the word &quot;expense&quot; as &quot;an expenditure of
			<lb />
			money, time, labor, or resources to accomplish a result; esp.,
			<lb />
			business expenditure chargeable against revenue for a specific
			<lb />
			period&quot; whereas the word as per Black&apos;s Law Dictionary is
			<lb />
			restricted to &quot;the amount paid or charged for something; process or
			<lb />
			expenditure&quot;. For this reason, the expression &quot;expenses&quot; appearing
			<lb />
			in Section 357(1)(a) would take into its ambit not only the costs of
			<lb />
			the court proceedings during the criminal trial or in hearing the
			<lb />
			appeal but also all expenses incurred after the crime till final
			<lb />
			adjudication including the expenses incurred on investigation, steps
			<lb />
			taken by the complainant as well as litigation generated.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			451. The expression &quot;properly incurred&quot; needs no elaboration as
			<lb />
			it clearly ousts all wasteful and unnecessary expenditure incurred
			<lb />
			in the prosecution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			452. The expression &quot;in prosecution&quot; is also not determinate. We
			<lb />
			had the occasion to examine the meaning of the expression
			<lb />
			&quot;prosecuted&quot;, in the decision dated 21 st December, 2012 in
			<lb />
			W.P.(C)No.7325/2010, Bheem Singh Meena v. Govt. of NCT of
			<lb />
			Delhi &amp; Ors., in the context of service jurisprudence and the
			<lb />
			failure of a new appointee to disclose on his attestation form that
			<lb />
			an FIR was registered against him and that a chargesheet was filed
			<lb />
			in the court of CJM in which he had been acquitted. We have
			<lb />
			referred to the following meanings of the expression &quot;prosecute&quot;
			<lb />
			and the &quot;prosecution&quot; in the Black&apos;s Law Dictionary and the
			<lb />
			Oxford Dictionary :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Black&apos;s Law Dictionary
			<lb />
			&quot;Prosecute -1. To commence and carry out a legal 2. To
			<lb />
			institute and pursue a criminal action against (a person).&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Oxford Dictionary
			<lb />
			&quot;Prosecute -To follow up, pursue; to persevere or persist in,
			<lb />
			follow out, go on with (some action, undertaking, or purpose) with
			<lb />
			a view to completing or attaining it. To institute legal proceedings
			<lb />
			against (a person) for some offence; to arraign before a court of
			<lb />
			justice for some crime or wrong.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			We have noted therefore, that the meaning of expression
			<lb />
			&quot;prosecution&quot; wide enough to include &quot;anything from registration
			<lb />
			of a case to conviction and punishment&quot;. It was also noted that
			<lb />
			&quot;challenges/defences to actions for malicious prosecution are
			<lb />
			premised on the pleading that the plaintiff was never prosecuted as
			<lb />
			he was not convicted&quot;, underscoring the restricted interpretations of
			<lb />
			the expression that are pressed by the legally trained minds in
			<lb />
			courts that &quot;prosecuted&quot; means &quot;convicted&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			453. The Oxford Dictionary refers to following up, pursuing,
			<lb />
			persevering or persisting with some action. The Black&apos;s Law
			<lb />
			Dictionary refers to instituting and pursuing criminal action. Both
			<lb />
			the dictionaries refer separately to legal proceedings.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			454. We have examined the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1985 of
			<lb />
			the United Kingdom, the Costs in Criminal Cases Act (Northern
			<lb />
			Ireland) 1968, Criminal Law, England and Wales as well as the
			<lb />
			Costs in Criminal Cases Act, 1967 of New Zealand. These
			<lb />
			enactments clearly refer to costs of prosecution. In U.K., the
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 338
			<lb />
			regulations indicate the Crown Prosecution Service. Section
			<lb />
			357(1)(a) also uses the preposition &quot;in&quot; and not &quot;of&quot; thereby
			<lb />
			suggesting that the legislative intent and object is not to restrict
			<lb />
			clause (a) either to court proceedings or the prosecution but would
			<lb />
			include all expenses &quot;reasonably incurred in prosecution&quot; that is
			<lb />
			from the stage when a crime occurs till final adjudication.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			455. The question which remains to be answered is as to whose
			<lb />
			expenses are to be defrayed under Section 357(1)(a) out of the fine
			<lb />
			which is imposed?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			456. It needs to be borne in mind that the Indian criminal justice
			<lb />
			system recognizes an important role as well as the rights of the
			<lb />
			complainant, rights from informing the police to lodging of a
			<lb />
			complaint at the police station, as well as filing a complaint
			<lb />
			directly in court (Section 200 Cr.P.C.) instituting an appeal against
			<lb />
			an acquittal in the case or seeking enhancement of sentence. These
			<lb />
			are all steps in prosecution of a criminal case, though by a private
			<lb />
			complainant.
			<lb />
			For this reason as well the expression &quot;in
			<lb />
			prosecution&quot; as used in Section 357(1)(a) cannot be restricted to
			<lb />
			the prosecution agency. It would include costs incurred by the
			<lb />
			complainant.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			457. Unlike other legislations, while drafting Section 357(1)(a),
			<lb />
			instead of &quot;by&quot; or &quot;of&quot;, the legislature has carefully used the
			<lb />
			preposition &quot;in&quot;. It would thus necessarily encompass all such
			<lb />
			expenses which have been necessitated for pursuing the matter.
			<lb />
			The &apos;expenses&apos; envisaged in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section
			<lb />
			357 are also therefore, not restricted merely to the expenses which
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 339
			<lb />
			have been incurred by the prosecution branch of the State but also
			<lb />
			the essential expenses incurred by the complainant or the victim for
			<lb />
			effecting the prosecution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			458. Such expenses would also necessarily be part of the financial
			<lb />
			injury and loss which a person (‗victim&apos; or someone entitled to
			<lb />
			compensation under Section 357) has been compelled to incur by
			<lb />
			reason of the crime.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			459. There is one other instrumentality which contributes to
			<lb />
			prosecution, which is the investigating agency. As noted above,
			<lb />
			the use of the expression &apos;expenses&apos; in the legislation instead of
			<lb />
			reference to mere &apos;costs&apos;, would suggest that the legislature has
			<lb />
			intended to apply the fine in defraying expenses properly incurred
			<lb />
			of the investigating agency as well.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			460. In view of the above discussion, the expression &apos;prosecution&apos;
			<lb />
			cannot be confined to legal proceedings in court or to the expenses
			<lb />
			incurred by the prosecution agency alone. The expression &apos;expenses
			<lb />
			properly incurred in prosecution&apos; has to encompass the expenses
			<lb />
			incurred by the complainant, investigating agency as well as the
			<lb />
			prosecution branch of the state. This view is supported by Section
			<lb />
			359 of the CrPC. Thus in the present case, an order under Section
			<lb />
			357(1)(a) for defraying expenses properly incurred in prosecution
			<lb />
			would cover expenses on all actions which were necessitated by
			<lb />
			the complainant, police and the State from the time the offences
			<lb />
			were committed till final adjudication.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			461. Given the statutory scheme and the mandate on the courts,
			<lb />
			while performing their duty, it is therefore, essential for the court to
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 340
			<lb />
			examine the matter and make an appropriate order in respect of
			<lb />
			clause(a) of Section(1) of Section 357 of the Cr.P.C. at the time of
			<lb />
			passing the judgment. By virtue of sub-section 4, the appellate
			<lb />
			court i.e. the high court or the court of session exercising revisional
			<lb />
			powers is also empowered to make the same order.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			462. It is necessary to consider as to what would be the position if
			<lb />
			a court imposes a sentence of which fine does not form a part.
			<lb />
			Sub-section 3 of Section 357 enables the court to order the accused
			<lb />
			person to pay by way of compensation such amount as may be
			<lb />
			specified in the order to the person who has suffered any loss or
			<lb />
			injury by reason of the act by which the accused person so
			<lb />
			sentenced. If the person who has suffered loss or injury is
			<lb />
			compelled to incur expenses in the prosecution, the same would
			<lb />
			necessarily form part of the financial loss which enures to such
			<lb />
			person because of the act for which the accused person has been
			<lb />
			convicted and sentenced. These are the principles on which the
			<lb />
			present case has to be examined.

			IDENTIFIED POINTS OF INQUIRY
			<lb />
			In the course of inquiry, in the first order sheet five factual
			<lb />
			issues were identified qua which inquiry was undertaken. These
			<lb />
			issues are as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			A.
			<lb />
			ISSUES RELATING TO VICTIM:
			<lb />
			
			<lb />
			Whether deceased Nitish Katara had left any
			<lb />
			dependents?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			
			<lb />
			Loss suffered by family of deceased Nitish Katara
			<lb />
			because of the actions or omissions of the persons
			<lb />
			convicted.
			<lb />
			
			<lb />
			Whether any compensation payable to his family?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			B.
			<lb />
			ISSUE QUA PAYING CAPACITY OF CONVICTS:
			<lb />
			
			<lb />
			To ascertain the paying capacity of the convicts i.e.
			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav, Vishal Yadav and Sukhdev Yadav.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			C.
			<lb />
			ISSUE QUA EXPENSES IN PROSECUTION:
			<lb />
			
			<lb />
			Ascertaining the expenses incurred in the conduct of
			<lb />
			prosecution of the case.
			<lb />
			Now, out of the factual inputs received during the verbal
			<lb />
			interaction apart from those received in the document form, an
			<lb />
			endeavour would be made to reach to the just conclusion in the
			<lb />
			above factual queries/issues.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			A.
			<lb />
			Results of inquiry qua issues relating to victim
			<lb />
			Inquiry Issue -Whether deceased Nitish Katara had left
			<lb />
			any dependents?
			<lb />
			Conclusion -
			<lb />
			Deceased Nitish Katara died at the young age of
			<lb />
			23 years. He was son of late Shri Nisheeth M. Katara and Smt.
			<lb />
			Neelam Katara is also survived by his younger brother Mr. Nitin
			<lb />
			Katara. Although issue carries the word dependent which tends to
			<lb />
			convey financial dependency of his surviving family members.
			<lb />
			However, in terms of definition of word &apos;Victim&apos; as contained in
			<lb />
			Section 2(wa) Cr.P.C. &quot;Victim&quot; means a person who has suffered
			<lb />
			any loss or injury caused by the reason of the act or omission for
			<lb />
			which the accused person has been charged and the expression
			<lb />
			&quot;victim&quot; includes his or her guardian or legal heir.

		<item>
			Inquiry Issue -Loss suffered by family of deceased Nitish
			<lb />
			Katara because of the actions or omissions of the persons
			<lb />
			convicted.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-
			<lb />
			Whether any compensation payable to his family
			<lb />
			Conclusion-
			<lb />
			The untimely loss of life of a young family
			<lb />
			member can never be assessed or calculated in money terms. Such
			<lb />
			loss of dear one in a family who was not only very well educated
			<lb />
			but also gainfully employed has many facets. The loss to the family
			<lb />
			manifests not only into tangible losses such as loss of wages etc.
			<lb />
			but it also leads to incalculable intangible losses like loss of love
			<lb />
			and affection, companionship, pain and suffering, reduction in
			<lb />
			quality of life of surviving family members and likewise.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			At the time of his untimely death actuated by the convicts
			<lb />
			deceased Nitish was at the prime of his youth. He had passed out of
			<lb />
			a prestigious Management College after doing his MBA in the year
			<lb />
			2000 from the Institute of Management and Technology,
			<lb />
			Ghaziabad. He was serving M/s. Reliance General Insurance
			<lb />
			Company Limited at Hansalaya Building, Barakhamba Road, New
			<lb />
			Delhi as Assistant Manager Marketing.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			He was getting a gross monthly salary of Rs.13,543/-as on
			<lb />
			January, 2002 before he was murdered in February, 2002.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			His father was a Class -I Gazetted Officer serving in Indian
			<lb />
			Railways and his mother was also a senior Govt. Officer working
			<lb />
			with Kendriya Vidhyala Sangathan.
			<lb />
			Upon conclusion of the inquiry, it is found that the family of
			<lb />
			deceased Nitish Katara is entitled to exemplary compensation on
			<lb />
			account of cold blooded murder of their loved one which per se
			<lb />
			was an act of honour killing. The calculation of the actual loss can
			<lb />
			be undertaken in terms of guidelines laid by Hon&apos;ble Delhi High
			<lb />
			Court in Satya Prakash Vs. State.
			<lb />

			B.
			<lb />
			Result of inquiry qua paying capacity of convicts:
			<lb />
			Inquiry Issue -To ascertain the paying capacity of the
			<lb />
			convicts i.e. Vikas Yadav, Vishal Yadav and Sukhdev Yadav.
			<lb />
			Conclusion -
			<lb />
			For the purpose of ascertaining the paying
			<lb />
			capacity of all the three convicts, directions were issued to them to
			<lb />
			file their affidavits disclosing all their movable and immovable
			<lb />
			assets, self acquired and inherited included. Also additional query
			<lb />
			sheet was served upon them in terms of case titled, &quot;Puneet Kaur&quot;
			<lb />
			(supra) asking details of their personal information, income assets
			<lb />
			apart from liabilities and expenditure.
			<lb />
			Detailed affidavits were filed along with list of properties by
			<lb />
			all the three convicts. However, the query sheets were replied in
			<lb />
			the course of interaction during the inquiry.
			<lb />
			Paying capacity of defendant Vikas Yadav -
			<lb />
			In his affidavit convict Vikas Yadav gave a detailed list of
			<lb />
			13 immovable properties located in State of U.P. and Uttarakhand.
			<lb />
			He also included details of immovable assets including equity
			<lb />
			shares in different companies. Cash and Bank balances, jewellery,
			<lb />
			investment and other loan advances.
			<lb />
			In response to the list of queries served upon the convict,
			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav disclosed that he is a qualified Engineer i.e. B.E.
			<lb />
			(Industrial Production) apart from having a MBA Degree. He is
			<lb />
			unmarried. He has a mother, father, one younger brother, two
			<lb />
			married sisters and an aged grandfather in family. He stated that he
			<lb />
			is getting around Rs.2.00 lacs per annum as rent. He has stated that
			<lb />
			he has incurred expenses of quite a substantial sum of amount and
			<lb />
			would have to incur further expenditure before Hon&apos;ble Supreme
			<lb />
			Court for filing an appeal as litigation cost.
			<lb />
			The affidavit contained only the purchase value of properties
			<lb />
			which were acquired mostly in early 90s. As such, as per his own
			<lb />
			assessment, Vikas Yadav disclosed assets of around Rs.2.59 Crores
			<lb />
			only. The affidavit was sent for verification to District Magistrate
			<lb />
			Ghaziabad and SSP, Ghaziabad. The verification report received
			<lb />
			both from DM and SSP Ghaziabad was not complete owing to
			<lb />
			paucity of time and some administrative difficulties. Out of the 13
			<lb />
			properties, valuation of the 8 properties could be done, which came
			<lb />
			to Rs.1.56 Crores as against the purchase of eight properties.
			<lb />
			Although the enhanced rates after two decades of purchase of the
			<lb />
			remaining properties could not be ascertained but even if an
			<lb />
			estimation is done in comparison to the other verified properties,
			<lb />
			which saw increase in valuation of around 9-10 times. The total
			<lb />
			valuation of his immovable assets would roughly come to
			<lb />
			Rs.3.25 -Rs.3.50 Crores, as per the properties declared
			<lb />
			purchased value of Rs.33.20 lacs around 18-20 years ago.
			<lb />
			When this approximate value of Rs.3.25 -Rs.3.50 Crores is
			<lb />
			added to declared movable assets then it comes to Rs.5.50 -
			<lb />
			Rs.5.75 Crores.
			<lb />
			As such the current paying capacity of defendant Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav is assessed to Rs.5.50 -Rs.5.75 Crores.
			<lb />
			Paying capacity of defendant Vishal Yadav -
			<lb />
			In his affidavit convict Vishal Yadav gave a detailed list of 5
			<lb />
			immovable properties located in State of U.P. apart from Cash
			<lb />
			Bank balances and jewellery.

			<lb />
			and is spending money on his daughter&apos;s education. He had spent
			<lb />
			Rs.25 lacs on his treatment which was raised from his mother and
			<lb />
			brother. He also has spent handsome amount on litigation till date
			<lb />
			and would have to incur further expenditure before the Hon&apos;ble
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in pursuing further litigation in the matter.
			<lb />
			The affidavit was sent for verification to the District
			<lb />
			Magistrate Ghaziabad and SSP, Ghaziabad. The verification report
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 349
			<lb />
			was received both from the DM and SSP Ghaziabad.
			<lb />
			As per the verification report, the value of his immovable
			<lb />
			properties as on today is Rs.9.16 Crores. The movable assets
			<lb />
			declared by him are Rs.3.17 lacs which makes the total paying
			<lb />
			capacity of Vishal Yadav as Rs.9.19 Crores.
			<lb />
			Paying capacity of defendant Sukhdev Yadav
			<lb />
			In his affidavit convict Sukhdev Yadav states that he does
			<lb />
			not have any movable or immovable property in India. However, in
			<lb />
			his interaction, in response to query sheets served upon him, he
			<lb />
			stated that he studied upto 12th standard and that his family
			<lb />
			consists of an aged father, wife, four unmarried daughters and one
			<lb />
			son (all children minors). He stated that his family owned 1.5
			<lb />
			bigha of land of which he has 1/5 th undivided share. He has

			<lb />
			litigation in the matter which he drew with the financial help of his
			<lb />
			family. His family is also incurring expenditure on education of
			<lb />
			his children which are taken care of by them.
			<lb />
			As such during the course of inquiry, no substantial fact
			<lb />
			came to the fore which could show that the convict Sukhdev Yadav
			<lb />
			has any financial mean to pay any substantial compensation to the
			<lb />
			family of deceased.

			<lb />
			investigation of the offence.
			<lb />
			Conclusion -
			<lb />
			As far as financial costs and expenses in the
			<lb />
			investigation in this case are concerned, repeat notices were issued
			<lb />
			to SSP, Ghaziabad apart from other interaction. In its report dated
			<lb />
			16.06.2014, SSP Ghaziabad stated that it would not be feasible for

			<lb />
			Conclusion -
			<lb />
			The murder in question had taken place in
			<lb />
			District Ghaziabad, U.P. under P.S. Kavi Nagar. The investigation
			<lb />
			was also carried there. However, on the application of Smt.Neelam
			<lb />
			Katara, the trial was transferred by Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court to
			<lb />
			District Courts, Delhi. Shri B.S. Joon was appointed as Special P.P.
			<lb />
			in this matter. As per his report shared with this office, he was paid
			<lb />
			professional fee of Rs.11,40,350/-by U.P. Police.
			<lb />
			Apart from this the appeal in this matter dealt with by

			<lb />
			Krishnan but she did not share with this office about any bill
			<lb />
			raised/payment received by her.
			<lb />
			Also several offshoots of this case were filed before Hon&apos;ble
			<lb />
			High Court of Delhi and Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court apart from

			provided security by Pune Police but no financial details could be
			<lb />
			sent by them on the plea that the record were infested by terminus.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			As far as protection provided to witness Sh. Ajay Katara,
			<lb />
			SSP Ghaziabad informed that the expenses incurred of
			<lb />
			Rs.62,01,006/-(Rs.62 lacs).

			<lb />
			administration in Trial Court as well as High Court and

		<item>
			Conclusion -
			<lb />
			Under this head the broad expenses are to be
			<lb />
			calculated both for District Courts and the High Court during the
			<lb />
			course of hearing of appeal. The methodology adopted under this
			<lb />
			head is to ascertain the entire functional cost of the District
			<lb />
			Courts/High Court for a particular year followed by dividing the
			<lb />
			same with the number of Judges functioning in the courts. This
			<lb />
			method was adopted as it had more merits and accuracy as
			<lb />
			compared to calculated costs of individual Courts only on the basis
			<lb />
			of number of officials/staff functioning there. other than the Court
			<lb />
			staff ancillary support wings like Copying Agency, Facilitation,
			<lb />
			Record Room and Infrastructure are also necessary for running of
			<lb />
			each Courts.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			There is an urgent need to ascertain the monthly, daily and
			<lb />
			even hourly cost of running of each individual court so as to have
			<lb />
			an empirical data to study the costing patterns.
			<lb />
			General public as well as functionaries of judiciary are
			<lb />
			supposed to know the each day&apos;s cost every court costs on the
			<lb />
			exchequer. This would go a long way to send a message across the
			<lb />
			Bar, Bench and the Public that unwarranted adjournments deserve
			<lb />
			to be curtailed and contained at any cost. There is also urgent need
			<lb />
			to have a system whereby time spent by each court on a particular
			<lb />
			case in hour/minute format shall be recorded. This practice would
			<lb />
			also go a long way to access the costing of each trial individually.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			In the absence of such detailed inputs, in this inquiry a rough
			<lb />
			estimation of expenditure incurred by judiciary in this case is
			<lb />
			sought to be ascertained. The estimation would only be an
			<lb />
			indicative figure under the principle of approximation.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			465. The learned OSD has noted that detailed inputs were not
			<lb />
			available and therefore provided a very rough estimation
			<lb />
			expenditure under this heading. We have noted above the practical
			<lb />
			difficulties in keeping the above records. In our country, several
			<lb />
			cases are listed before the trial court as well as the High Court and
			<lb />
			it is almost impossible to ignore the other work on assigned rosters
			<lb />
			to give single minded attention to a single case. The report notes
			<lb />
			that the two trials were listed on 276 and 101 dates while the three
			<lb />
			appeals were listed on 107 days.
			<lb />
			The estimation of the expenditure under this heading is
			<lb />
			admittedly a rough estimation, which in the noted circumstances,
			<lb />
			recovery of full estimated amount cannot be based thereon or
			<lb />
			ordered to be recovered from the defendants. Till details of actual
			<lb />
			court time spent on the cases is provided, it would be unfair to
			<lb />
			compute the cost thereof.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			466. Let us examine the other expenses examined in the report :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Inquiry sub-Issue (e)-
			<lb />
			All expenses incurred by
			<lb />
			the Jail Administration in providing boarding and
			<lb />
			lodging of accused/convicts.
			<lb />
			Conclusion -As data shared by Jail Administration,
			<lb />
			the expenses incurred in boarding lodging of the three
			<lb />
			convicts in Jail during trial and thereafter is
			<lb />
			Rs.35,60,169/-(Rs.35.60 lacs)
			<lb />
			Inquiry sub-Issue (f)-All expenses incurred in escorted

			<lb />
			from
			<lb />
			Jail
			<lb />

			Court/Hospitals during the period of their detention.
			<lb />
			Conclusion -As data shared by DCP IIIrd Battalion,
			<lb />
			the expenses incurred in transportation, security and
			<lb />
			manpower for the three convicts from Jail to

			FINAL CONCLUSION ON COSTS
			<lb />
			The total expenditure incurred on this case by the exchequer is
			<lb />
			Rs.5.86 Crores (Rupees Five Crores Eighty Six Lacs).
			<lb />
			Quantification of compensation in the present case
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			467. In the present case, we are concerned with the offence of
			<lb />
			murder, executed with premeditation, planning and full knowledge
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 356
			<lb />
			of the impact of their acts. The defendants removed all signs of
			<lb />
			identification, including the clothes of the deceased, jewellery,
			<lb />
			watch and mobile phone and burnt his body beyond identification.
			<lb />
			One of the defendants was at that time, facing trial for an offence
			<lb />
			in another murder case. After a proper enquiry into the means of
			<lb />
			the defendants, the above circumstances of the crime as well as the
			<lb />
			non-pecuniary factors noted by us have to be factored into
			<lb />
			consideration of the compensation by the multiplier method. This
			<lb />
			is essential so as to ensure a ‗just&apos; and ‗adequate compensation&apos; to
			<lb />
			the victim/family/dependants.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			468. We may note that a categorical submission was made by Mr.
			<lb />
			Sumeet Verma and Mr. Sanjay Jain, learned counsels for Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav and Vishal Yadav that they have no objection to
			<lb />
			computation and payment of compensation on the multiplier basis.
			<lb />
			We may also note the endorsement of the multiplier method
			<lb />
			for computation of compensation by Mr. Sumeet Verma who in his
			<lb />
			written submissions has stated that the quantum of compensation
			<lb />
			has been endorsed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			469. In the present case, after receipt of the inquiry report and
			<lb />
			during arguments under Section 357 of the CrPC, an affidavit dated
			<lb />
			3 rd December, 2014 has been filed by the complainant Mrs. Nilam
			<lb />
			Katara deposing as follows:
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 357
			<lb />
			&quot;I, Nilam Katara w/o Late Shri N.M. Katara, aged about
			<lb />
			62 years, R/o of 7 Chelmsford Road, New Delhi, do
			<lb />
			hereby solemnly affirm and state as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			1.
			<lb />
			That I am the above named deponent and
			<lb />
			complainant in the above mentioned case, as such
			<lb />
			conversant with facts of this case and am competent to
			<lb />
			swear this affidavit.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			2.
			<lb />
			That the deponent, mother of deceased of Nitish
			<lb />
			Katara with utmost humility states as follows:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			I.
			<lb />
			That deponent is a person of very limited
			<lb />
			means and now even those means stand further
			<lb />
			depleted by a long ongoing legal process.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			II.
			<lb />
			That inspite of the above, deponent&apos;s
			<lb />
			conscience does not allow her to let a numerical
			<lb />
			figure be assigned to the value of life and liberty of
			<lb />
			her deceased son. That it would be an insult to and
			<lb />
			desecrate the memory of her deceased son if such
			<lb />
			an amount was even computed.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			III. That any such calculation/computation and
			<lb />
			payment would cause deponent utmost pain and
			<lb />
			she trusts it is never the aim of Article 357(A)
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. to add to the trauma and misery caused to
			<lb />
			deponent by losing her young son.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			IV. That the deponent beseeches this
			<lb />
			Honourable Court that in respect of her deceased
			<lb />
			son no amount may be calculated/computed as
			<lb />
			&apos;compensation to the victim&apos;s family&apos; and recovered
			<lb />
			from the convicts for disbursing to deponent or any
			<lb />
			other person or organization or for any Charitable
			<lb />
			or other purposes (including legal aid services).&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)

		<p>
			470. In deference to the above sentiments of the mother of the
			<lb />
			deceased victim, we are refraining from embarking on the enquiry
			<lb />
			into the actual quantification of the amount of fair compensation to
			<lb />
			his family.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			XIV. Expenses incurred in prosecution of FIR No.192/2002
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			471. We may note that the report submitted by Mr. S.S. Rathi,
			<lb />
			OSD, DLSA does not take into consideration the several cases
			<lb />
			which have been filed by the defendants at different stages in the
			<lb />
			trial in trial courts at Dabra, Ghaziabad, Delhi; the High Courts of
			<lb />
			Allahabad and Delhi as well as the Supreme Court of India which
			<lb />
			had to be defended by the State as well as the complainant to
			<lb />
			ensure the prosecution. It also does not take into consideration the
			<lb />
			cases which were necessitated and filed by the state or the
			<lb />
			complainant to ensure due process in the trial and for prosecution
			<lb />
			of her complaint. We propose to examine the material available in
			<lb />
			this regard.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			472. In our judgment dated 2 nd April, 2014, we have adverted to
			<lb />
			the litigation generated at the instance of the defendants as well as
			<lb />
			legal actions which were necessary to ensure the effective
			<lb />
			prosecution of the defendants.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			473. In the present consideration, we called upon all parties to
			<lb />
			disclose litigation in regard to the FIR No.192/2002. The
			<lb />
			complainant Nilam Katara and the State have filed the list of some
			<lb />
			cases which we propose to discuss hereafter. None of the
			<lb />
			defendants have placed any such information before us. In fact, the
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 359
			<lb />
			status report filed by the State giving the details of the cases and
			<lb />
			their status sheds valuable light on the issue under consideration.
			<lb />
			Smt. Nilam Katara has filed a list of some cases as well.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			474. Despite our directions, the defence have failed to submit the
			<lb />
			list of cases before us. On scrutiny of the record of the case, we
			<lb />
			find that in Crl.A.No.910/2008, Smt. Nilam Katara filed
			<lb />
			Crl.M.A.No.6376/2010, an application under Section 482 of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. for permission to assist the court in the criminal appeal.
			<lb />
			This application was staunchly opposed on behalf of the defendant
			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav. In support of her application, Mrs. Nilam Katara
			<lb />
			inter alia urged that she had filed or contested a number of petitions
			<lb />
			in connection with FIR No.192/2002 from which the cases arose.
			<lb />
			In this regard, the details of several cases mentioned by Mrs. Nilam
			<lb />
			Katara have been recorded in the order dated 4 th August, 2010
			<lb />
			passed by the Division Bench allowing the application. We set
			<lb />
			down hereunder a compilation revealed from the status report by
			<lb />
			the State; tabulation submitted by Smt. Nilam Katara; cases noted
			<lb />
			in the order dated 4 th August, 2010 and; those which may have
			<lb />
			been noted from the available record as well as their status
			<lb />
			whatsoever disclosed by the parties:

			justice including the transfer of proceedings from the Ghaziabad
			<lb />
			District Courts to District Courts at Delhi; orders for examination

			writ petition was filed by the accused persons at Allahabad High
			<lb />
			Court, though details thereof are not available.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			476. In a case like the present one, this litigation was essential to
			<lb />
			ensure the effective proceedings in the trial against the convicts i.e.
			<lb />
			prosecution. We have noted certain legal steps taken by the
			<lb />
			Ghaziabad police at High Court of Allahabad, Dabra, M.P.;
			<lb />
			Ghaziabad, U.P.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			477. At the same time, the defendants filed several cases which
			<lb />
			had to be defended by the State as well as the complainant in order
			<lb />
			to prevent orders which may have interdicted effective proceedings
			<lb />
			against these persons. To the extent that against their convictions
			<lb />
			and sentencing by the trial court at Delhi, appeals were first filed
			<lb />
			by the defendants in the High Court of Allahabad! These were
			<lb />
			dismissed by the High Court of Allahabad, which dismissals were
			<lb />
			assailed by the defendants in the Supreme Court of India.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			478. The expenditure which had to be incurred by the
			<lb />
			complainant as well as the State in pursuing/defending these cases
			<lb />
			has to form part of the &quot;expenses properly incurred in prosecution&quot;
			<lb />
			as referred to in Section 357(1)(a). We are of the view that
			<lb />
			consciously of this, the three defendants have deliberately withheld
			<lb />
			all details thereof.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			479. It was orally submitted by Nilam Katara that she has
			<lb />
			incurred expenditure of over Rs.70,00,000/-in the cases. The
			<lb />
			mother of the deceased had to engage counsels and vigorously
			<lb />
			pursue the cases at every stage after the lodging of the FIR.

			<lb />
			pg. 368
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			480. The criminal trials, as in the present cases, reflect the
			<lb />
			impunity with which defendants hold the criminal justice system at
			<lb />
			ransom.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			481. Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India protects a person
			<lb />
			accused of any offence from being compelled to be a witness
			<lb />
			against himself. Article 21, which protects the life and personal
			<lb />
			liberty of all persons, states that no person shall be deprived of his
			<lb />
			life or personal liberty except according to procedure prescribed by
			<lb />
			law.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			482. This constitutional protection, a fundamental right, stands
			<lb />
			statutorily recognized inter alia in Section 161 of the Cr.P.C. which
			<lb />
			enables examination of such persons who are supposed to be
			<lb />
			acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case by the
			<lb />
			police. Sub-section (2) of Section 161 binds such person to
			<lb />
			truthfully answer all questions relating to the case &quot;other than
			<lb />
			questions the answers to which would have a tendency to expose
			<lb />
			him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or a forfeiture&quot;. Section
			<lb />
			162 prohibits signature of the statement by the person making it
			<lb />
			and also bars the use of the statement or any part thereof for any
			<lb />
			purpose at any inquiry or trial in respect of the offence under
			<lb />
			investigation at the time when the statement was made other than
			<lb />
			such statement being used by the accused and, with the permission
			<lb />
			of the court, by the prosecution, to contradict such witness in
			<lb />
			accordance with Section 145 of the Evidence Act. These are the
			<lb />
			protections made available during investigation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			483. During the course of trial, under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
			in every inquiry or trial, the court is required to give an opportunity
			<lb />
			to the accused to personally explain any circumstances appearing
			<lb />
			in the evidence against him. Sub-section 3 of Section 313 grants
			<lb />
			the right of silence to the accused when it mandates that the
			<lb />
			accused shall not render himself liable to punishment by refusing
			<lb />
			to answer the questions by the court or by giving false answers to
			<lb />
			them.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			484. So far as an accused appearing as a witness is concerned,
			<lb />
			Section 315(1) of the CrPC gives protection to the accused to the
			<lb />
			effect that he shall not be called as a witness except on his own
			<lb />
			request in writing and that his failure to give evidence shall not be
			<lb />
			made the subject of any comment by any of the parties or the court
			<lb />
			or give rise to any presumption against him or any person charged
			<lb />
			with him in the same trial.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			485. So far as the Indian Evidence Act is concerned, protections
			<lb />
			qua statements made during investigation are given to the accused
			<lb />
			person in Sections 24 to 27 of the Indian Evidence Act.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			486. Unfortunately, experience has shown that the unduly
			<lb />
			exaggerated concerns with the rights of the defendants as well as
			<lb />
			aggressive posturing by or on their behalf have discouraged courts
			<lb />
			from proactively engaging with the acts and omissions by or on
			<lb />
			behalf of the defendant which are way beyond the constitutional
			<lb />
			and statutory protections. As a result of these, defendants in
			<lb />
			criminal trials get away with misleading investigation, threatening
			<lb />
			prosecutors, witnesses, the police and misbehaviour in courts.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

			<lb />
			Trials are protracted because witnesses are pressurised, if not
			<lb />
			prevented from coming to court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			487. Our judgment dated 2 nd of April, 2014 upholding the
			<lb />
			convictions of these defendants has noted in detail several such
			<lb />
			actions by Vikas and Vishal Yadav two of the defendants before
			<lb />
			us. The right to silence only enables the accused person to remain
			<lb />
			silent -it does permit the accused to, for instance, lead the police
			<lb />
			on a wild goose chase, to say Alwar, Rajasthan as in the present
			<lb />
			case to recover a vehicle which they know is not there but located
			<lb />
			at another location in another State wherefrom it was actually
			<lb />
			recovered.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			488. In this regard, para 2000 of our judgment dated 2nd of April,
			<lb />
			2014 is pertinent and we extract it hereunder:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;2000.
			<lb />
			One aspect of this conduct of accused
			<lb />
			persons seldom talked about is the huge demand it makes
			<lb />
			on the investigation agency and the criminal justice
			<lb />
			system both in terms of manpower but also from the
			<lb />
			point of view of public funds which are compelled to be
			<lb />
			expended. Just to visualize the expenditure incurred on
			<lb />
			the 28th February, 10th/11th March is mind boggling.
			<lb />
			The public exchequer has had to provide for the
			<lb />
			Ghaziabad police personnel required to escort two
			<lb />
			accused persons -first to go to Dabra to secure custody;
			<lb />
			proceed with them to Alwar and then again to Panipat -
			<lb />
			both places where nothing was to be recovered -and
			<lb />
			then to Karnal. Not to say the incidental costs of
			<lb />
			transportation boarding,
		</item>
		<p>
			etc. The already stretched police
			<lb />
			force can ill afford such fruit less exercises. No provision
			<lb />
			of our Constitution of India or the law entitles accused
			<lb />
			persons to abuse the protections afforded to them in this
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 371
			<lb />
			manner and to deliberately misguide investigations and
			<lb />
			the courts.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			489. The third defendant Sukhdev Yadav compelled a second trial
			<lb />
			by absconding from justice for a period of over three years-
			<lb />
			obviously intending to exhaust the witnesses, prosecutors and the
			<lb />
			complainant. The rights available to the accused do not extend to
			<lb />
			abscondance. On the contrary, law postulates such persons to
			<lb />
			make themselves available to the police which is searching for
			<lb />
			them.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			490. In para 1603 of our judgment dated 2nd of April, 2014, we
			<lb />
			have noted the impact of such abscondance in the following terms:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;1603.
			<lb />
			We also find that this abscondance is part of
			<lb />
			a design. Having compelled the court to proceed with the
			<lb />
			trial of Vikas and Vishal Yadav in the absence of their
			<lb />
			accomplice, by the 23rd of February 2005 when Sukhdev
			<lb />
			Yadav was arrested, evidence of thirty seven prosecution
			<lb />
			witnesses (out of a total of forty three) stood completed
			<lb />
			in that trial. Many of the witnesses who had been already
			<lb />
			examined, had to be recalled in Sukhdev‗s trial. It
			<lb />
			appears that the calculated attempt was to pressurise and
			<lb />
			exhaust witnesses; take advantage of memory fading by
			<lb />
			passage of time and resultant omissions and
			<lb />
			contradictions; orchestrated deviations; loss of evidence
			<lb />
			by non-availability of witnesses at the second trial. By
			<lb />
			his conduct, the appellant has not only violated statutory
			<lb />
			provisions but has obstructed the due course of justice
			<lb />
			and expedition in the trial.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			491. One glaring instance of the manner in which both
			<lb />
			investigation and trials were delayed is the manner in which Bharti
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 372
			<lb />
			Yadav was first shifted from one State to another i.e. from
			<lb />
			Ghaziabad (U.P.) to Faridabad (Haryana) immediately after the
			<lb />
			crime on 16/17.2.2002 to prevent access to her of the U.P. Police.
			<lb />
			As a result, her statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. could be
			<lb />
			recorded only on 2 nd March, 2002 by the investigating officer.
			<lb />
			During the trial, Bharti Yadav was removed from the boundaries of
			<lb />
			India and sent to U.K. as noted in the judgment dated 2 nd April,
			<lb />
			2014. Even her address was not furnished to enable the
			<lb />
			prosecution to summon her. In court, she was represented by
			<lb />
			father and an uncle of Vikas Yadav (who were also uncles of
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav). Bharti Yadav played hide and seek with the court
			<lb />
			for over three years holding up the trial. This was obviously at the
			<lb />
			instance of these defendants.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			492. What makes a really pathetic story is the manner in which
			<lb />
			the inability of the prosecution to examine this witness was utilised
			<lb />
			by the defendant Vikas Yadav in making multiple applications for
			<lb />
			bail on the ground that in view of the delay in the trial, his
			<lb />
			incarceration was unwarranted. The complainant had to move
			<lb />
			heaven and earth to ensure that Bharti Yadav was examined as a
			<lb />
			witness, in as much as the prosecutor at the trial court frustrated by
			<lb />
			the efforts to secure her appearance and the extreme pressure put
			<lb />
			by the defendants on the ground of the resultant delay in trial, gave
			<lb />
			her up as a prosecution witness. All this generated extensive
			<lb />
			litigation including several petitions and applications as noted
			<lb />
			above.
			<lb />
			The defendants have to compensate the complainant and the
			<lb />
			State for the expenses incurred on all this litigation by their act of
			<lb />
			keeping Bharti Yadav out of court in as much as her examination
			<lb />
			was an essential part in their prosecution for the crime.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			493. There is yet another distressing facet of the proceedings in
			<lb />
			the present case, right from the trial to the appellate court. On the
			<lb />
			remote chance that the other sides would either not point out or it
			<lb />
			would escape notice, protracted arguments on principles which
			<lb />
			have been settled by judicial pronouncements are made,
			<lb />
			compelling wastage of judicial time.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			494. We also find that advantage is taken of the fact that
			<lb />
			prosecutors are either changed or compelled to be changed.
			<lb />
			Certainly, there is no continuity of prosecutors from the trial court
			<lb />
			to the appellate court. As a result, important proceedings in the
			<lb />
			higher courts are not placed before the trial courts.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			495. On 25 th February, 2002, Nilam Katara filed a habeas corpus
			<lb />
			writ in the Supreme Court, then filed W.P.(Crl.)No.247/2002 on
			<lb />
			27 th February, 2002 in this court inter alia seeking the following:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;(viii) Issue a writ of Habeas Corpus or an order or

			to produce Nitish Ktara son of the petitioner, forthwith;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ix) Issue a writ of mandamus directing the

			recovered by the respondent no.4
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(x) Issue a writ of mandamus or an order or direction
			<lb />
			in the nature thereof, in the alternative, in the event the

			<lb />
			petitioner has died, directing the respondent no.1 to 5 to
			<lb />
			investigate into the matter of the unnatural death of
			<lb />
			Nitish Katara son of the petitioner with expedition,
			<lb />
			exactitude, efficiently and meticulously.
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(xii) Issue any other writ, order or direction in favour
			<lb />
			of the petitioner to which the petitioner may in law be
			<lb />
			found entitled to in the facts and circumstances of the

			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			496. In the writ petition, Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav were
			<lb />
			impleaded as respondent nos. 7 and 8. The father of Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
			was impleaded as respondent no.6. The record of this writ petition
			<lb />
			discloses that the Ghaziabad police filed three status reports dated
			<lb />
			14 th March, 2002, 3 rd April, 2002 and 28 th April, 2002 in this writ
			<lb />
			petition. In each of these reports filed by Shri Prashant Kumar, Sr.
			<lb />
			Superintendent of Police, all steps taken in the investigation up to
			<lb />
			the date of the status report were set out in detail. So much so that
			<lb />
			the status report dated 14 th March, 2002 clearly sets out the
			<lb />
			disclosures made on 25th February, 2002 by Vikas Yadav and
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav as well as the recoveries of the hammer and wrist
			<lb />
			watch made pursuant thereto on 28 th February, 2002. All details of
			<lb />
			the recovery of the Tata Safari car on 11th March, 2002 from their
			<lb />
			factory in Karnal have also been set out. These status reports detail
			<lb />
			the statements made by the persons examined under Section 161 of
			<lb />
			the CrPC. The police also set out the several steps taken to trace
			<lb />
			and arrest the accused persons.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			497. It is noteworthy that Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav as
			<lb />
			respondent nos.7 and 8 have filed a joint counter affidavit dated
			<lb />
			13th March, 2002 wherein they make a reference to the remand
			<lb />
			which was sought by the Ghaziabad police from the CJM,
			<lb />
			Ghaziabad which was initially declined; the order of the CJM
			<lb />
			upheld by the District Judge, Ghaziabad and the subsequent orders
			<lb />
			of the CJM. Vikas Yadav as respondent no.7 filed
			<lb />
			Crl.Misc.No.862/2002 on 5 th October, 2002 under Section 340 of
			<lb />
			the Cr.P.C.contending that the petitioner Nilam Katara had made
			<lb />
			wild allegations regarding his conduct in the Jessica Lal&apos;s case as
			<lb />
			well as the writ petition while seeking initiation of criminal
			<lb />
			proceedings against Nilam Katara. It is noteworthy that neither
			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav nor Vishal Yadav make any dispute at any time that
			<lb />
			they had not made the disclosure statements or that the articles
			<lb />
			were recovered at their instance. In the writ petitions, these
			<lb />
			defendants were represented by the common counsels who
			<lb />
			represented them before the trial court as well. Despite this position
			<lb />
			in the writ proceedings which were contemporaneous with the
			<lb />
			investigation, protracted submissions were made before the trial
			<lb />
			court challenging the disclosures as well as the recoveries. Before
			<lb />
			us, separate counsels for each of the defendants pressed similar
			<lb />
			challenges. In fact, the three status reports manifest that
			<lb />
			investigations in the present case stood really monitored by the
			<lb />
			court in W.P.(Crl.)No.247/2002 and several of the objections
			<lb />
			pressed before the trial court as well as us were completely
			<lb />
			unwarranted, given the conduct of the defendants in not
			<lb />
			challenging the status reports filed by the police.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			498. The constitutional or statutory protections do not permit any
			<lb />
			defendant to mislead or misdirect the police or the courts. The
			<lb />
			protections also do not extend to such conduct of the defendants.
			<lb />
			They also do not tolerate the deliberate actions in misdirecting the
			<lb />
			police and investigators. For this reason as well, costs incurred by
			<lb />
			the prosecution in the litigation so generated have to be defrayed
			<lb />
			out of fine which may be imposed upon them.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			499. It can very well be argued that law provides for penal actions
			<lb />
			for misleading the police, it provides for action under the Contempt
			<lb />
			of Courts Act if any action impedes course of proceedings in the
			<lb />
			court. However, these statutory provisions do not take into
			<lb />
			consideration the financial burden which results to the public
			<lb />
			exchequer or the complainant as a result. We have no manner of
			<lb />
			doubt that the defendants in the present case have to defray the
			<lb />
			expenditure incurred by the State as well as the complainant for the
			<lb />
			expenses incurred in the investigation, trials and all the litigation
			<lb />
			generated because of the deliberate acts and omissions of the
			<lb />
			defendants for their effective prosecution in FIR no.192/2002.
			<lb />
			This court has the jurisdiction by virtue of Section 357(1)(a) of the
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 377
			<lb />
			CrPC that such fine as may be imposed, is defrayed towards these
			<lb />
			expenses.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			500. The inquiry report has computed total expenditure under the
			<lb />
			witness protection head at Rs.3.89 crores. In addition, the
			<lb />
			expenses incurred on the Special Public Prosecutor, who conducted
			<lb />
			the trials, and the Additional Standing Counsel in the appeal, cost
			<lb />
			of Rs.46.71 lakhs has enured. So far as the investigating agency is
			<lb />
			concerned, the expenses have been notionally quantified at Rs.2
			<lb />
			lakhs Mrs. Nilam Katara has claimed that she had incurred
			<lb />
			expenditure of over Rs.70 lakhs on pursuing the matters relating to
			<lb />
			the murder of her son besides the expenditure in the present
			<lb />
			hearings. We have not been provided any details of the
			<lb />
			expenditure which has enured to the complainant or the State in the
			<lb />
			present cases.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			501. Pursuant to receipt of the inquiry report under Section 357
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. and the opportunity given by us, brief submissions dated
			<lb />
			17 th July, 2014 on behalf of defendant no.2 Vishal Yadav were
			<lb />
			filed through his learned counsel Mr. Sanjay Jain, Advocate stating
			<lb />
			therein that the respondent has 1/4 th share as against 1/3 rd share in
			<lb />
			the property as mentioned in the inquiry report. He has further
			<lb />
			stated that the judgments only talk about compensating the victim
			<lb />
			and not the cost of the prosecution. It is further stated that as per
			<lb />
			the inquiry report, the cost of prosecution is really only the amount
			<lb />
			spent on the protection of witnesses which cannot be fastened on
			<lb />
			his client since there was no threat to witnesses either from him or
			<lb />
			his family; that Vishal Yadav has been released on bail/parole
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 378
			<lb />
			thrice and there is no allegation against him that he threatened the
			<lb />
			witnesses during this period.
			<lb />
			Inasmuch as we do not propose to direct defraying full costs
			<lb />
			of the investigation, litigation or the expenses incurred on
			<lb />
			providing protection to witnesses, nothing would turn on this
			<lb />
			aspect of the matter.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			XV. Sentencing Principles
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			502. We have so far considered the several aspects relating to
			<lb />
			procedure to be followed and the orders which a sentencing court
			<lb />
			may pass as well as the considerations for the same. Before
			<lb />
			proceeding to the examination of the sentence which befits the
			<lb />
			crimes and the defendants in the present case, we need to advert to
			<lb />
			the jurisprudence on the principles on which sentencing must be
			<lb />
			effected.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			503. Light on the question as to how a sentence is to be imposed
			<lb />
			has to be gathered from the pronouncements of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			inasmuch as the legislation gives no indication. In the judgment
			<lb />
			reported at (1974) 3 SCC 85, B.G. Goswami v. Delhi Admn., the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court observed that the &quot;question of sentence is always a
			<lb />
			difficult question, requiring as it does, proper adjustment and
			<lb />
			balancing of various considerations appropriate quantum in a
			<lb />
			given case&quot;. It was further observed as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;10. ... The main purpose of the sentence broadly stated
			<lb />
			is that the accused must realise that he has committed
			<lb />
			an act which is not only harmful to the society of which
			<lb />
			he forms an integral part but is also harmful to his own
			<lb />
			future, both as an individual and as a member of the
			<lb />
			society. Punishment is designed to protect society by
			<lb />
			deterring potential offenders as also by preventing the
			<lb />
			guilty party from repeating the offence; it is also
			<lb />
			designed to reform the offender and reclaim him as a
			<lb />
			law abiding citizen for the good of the society as a
			<lb />
			whole. Reformatory, deterrent and punitive aspects of
			<lb />
			punishment thus play their due part in judicial thinking
			<lb />
			while determining this question. In modern civilized
			<lb />
			societies, however, reformatory aspect is being given
			<lb />
			somewhat greater importance. Too lenient as well as too
			<lb />
			harsh sentence both lose their efficaciousness. One does
			<lb />
			not deter and the other may frustrate, thereby making the
			<lb />
			offender a hardened criminal. …‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			504. We may usefully refer to the pronouncement of the Punjab
			<lb />
			High Court reported at AIR 1960 Pun 482, Lekhraj v. State. This
			<lb />
			judgment authored by Justice Dua (as his Lordship then was), sets
			<lb />
			out the relevance of the offender&apos;s circumstances and social milieu,
			<lb />
			apart from the daring and reprehensible nature of the offence for
			<lb />
			sentencing puposes.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			505. In its 47 th Report dated 28 th February, 1972, the Law
			<lb />
			Commission of India stated that guidelines cannot direct
			<lb />
			sentencing with mathematical precision, that sentencing discretion
			<lb />
			to the judge must be maintained; and had summed up the
			<lb />
			components of the proper sentence. We set down hereunder the
			<lb />
			relevant recommendations in the 47 th Report in paras 7.44, 7.45
			<lb />
			and 7.47:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-7.44 A proper sentence is a composite of many factors,
			<lb />
			including the nature of the offence, the circumstances -
			<lb />
			extenuating or aggravating -of the offence, the prior
			<lb />
			criminal record, if any, of the offender, the age of the
			<lb />
			offender, the professional and social record of the
			<lb />
			offender, the background of the offender with reference
			<lb />
			to education, home life, sobriety and social adjustment,
			<lb />
			the emotional and mental condition of the offender, the
			<lb />
			prospect for the rehabilitation of the offender, the
			<lb />
			possibility of a return of the offender to normal life in the
			<lb />
			community, the possibility of treatment or of training of
			<lb />
			the offender, the possibility that the sentence may serve
			<lb />
			as a deterrent to crime by this offender, or by others, and
			<lb />
			the present community need, if any, for such a deterrent
			<lb />
			in respect to the particular type of offence involved.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			7.45. The variables in each case, including the accused&apos;s
			<lb />
			prior criminal record, his background and the condition
			<lb />
			of his health, the prospect of rehabilitation and many
			<lb />
			other factors are unpredictable, and it is for this reason
			<lb />
			that a discretion should preferably vest with the judicial
			<lb />
			officer.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			7.47. For these reasons, we do not think that the
			<lb />
			discretion of the court to award a sentence below the
			<lb />
			minimum should be totally abolished. In fact, even some
			<lb />
			of the officers concerned with enforcement of the Acts
			<lb />
			agreed that it was impossible to conceive of every
			<lb />
			possible situation which might operate in mitigation.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			506. In (1976) 1 SCC 281, Ramashraya Chakravarti v. State of
			<lb />
			M.P., the Supreme Court held thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-Sentencing undoubtedly involves an element of
			<lb />
			guessing but it is always a matter of judicial discretion
			<lb />
			subject to any mandatory minimum prescribed by law.
			<lb />
			In judging the adequacy of a sentence, the nature of the
			<lb />
			offence, the circumstances of its commission, the age
			<lb />
			and character of the offender, injury to the individuals
			<lb />
			or to society, effect of the punishment on the offender,
			<lb />
			eye to correlation and reformation of the offender, are
			<lb />
			some among many other factors which should be
			<lb />
			ordinarily taken into consideration by Court.‖

			507. Recommending flexibility in choice of punishments, noting
			<lb />
			judgments of the Punjab and Kerala High Courts as well as the 47 th
			<lb />
			Report of Law Commission of India, in the pronouncement

			reported at (1977) 3 SCC 287, Mohd. Giasuddin v. State of A.P.,
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			V. Krishna Iyer, J. had stated thus:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-14. … The Kerala High Court, in Shiva Prasad [1969
			<lb />
			Ker LT 862] had also something useful to say in this
			<lb />
			regard:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			‗Criminal trial in our country is largely devoted
			<lb />
			only to finding out whether the man in the dock is
			<lb />
			guilty. It is a major deficiency in the Indian
			<lb />
			system of criminal trials that the complex but
			<lb />
			important sentencing factors are not given
			<lb />
			sufficient emphasis and materials are not
			<lb />
			presented before the Court to help it for a correct
			<lb />
			judgment in the proper personalised, punitive
			<lb />
			treatment suited to the offender and the crime....&quot;
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			17. It will thus be seen that there is a great discretion
			<lb />
			vested in the Judge, especially when pluralistic factors
			<lb />
			enter his calculations. Even so, the Judge must exercise
			<lb />
			this discretionary power, drawing his inspiration from
			<lb />
			the humanitarian spirit of the law, and living down the
			<lb />
			traditional precedents which have winked at the
			<lb />
			personality of the crime-doer and been swept away by
			<lb />
			the features of the crime. What is dated has to be
			<lb />
			discarded. What is current has to be incorporated.
			<lb />
			Therefore innovation, in all conscience, is in the field of
			<lb />
			judicial discretion.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			18. Unfortunately, the Indian Penal Code still lingers in
			<lb />
			the somewhat compartmentalised system of punishment
			<lb />
			viz. imprisonment, simple or rigorous, fine and, of
			<lb />
			course, capital sentence. There is a wide range of
			<lb />
			choice and flexible treatment which must be available
			<lb />
			with the Judge if he is to fulfil his tryst with curing the
			<lb />
			criminal in a hospital setting. Maybe in an appropriate
			<lb />
			case actual hospital treatment may have to be
			<lb />
			prescribed as part of the sentence. In another case,
			<lb />
			liberal parole may have to be suggested and, yet in a
			<lb />
			third category, engaging in certain types of occupation
			<lb />
			or even going through meditational drills or other
			<lb />
			courses may be part of the sentencing prescription. The
			<lb />
			perspective having changed, the legal strategies and
			<lb />
			judicial resources, in their variety, also have to change.
			<lb />
			Rule of thumb sentences of rigorous imprisonment or
			<lb />
			other are too insensitive to the highly delicate and
			<lb />
			subtle operation expected of a sentencing Judge.
			<lb />
			Release on probation, conditional sentences, visits to
			<lb />
			healing centres, are all on the cards. We do not wish to
			<lb />
			be exhaustive. Indeed, we cannot be.
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Thus as back as in the year 1977, the Supreme Court had
			<lb />
			emphasized that the sentence proceedings should be personalized
			<lb />
			from a reformative angle as well as the appropriateness of
			<lb />
			conditional sentence as part of sentencing prescriptions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			508. Twenty five years later, in the judgment reported at (2012) 8
			<lb />
			SCC 537, State of U.P. v. Sanjay Kumar, the Supreme Court has
			<lb />
			reiterated the need for discretion in sentencing, stating thus:
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 383
			<lb />
			-21. xxx Sentencing policies are needed to address
			<lb />
			concerns in relation to unfettered judicial discretion and
			<lb />
			lack of uniform and equal treatment of similarly
			<lb />
			situated convicts. The principle of proportionality, as
			<lb />
			followed in various judgments of this Court, prescribes
			<lb />
			that, the punishments should reflect the gravity of the
			<lb />
			offence and also the criminal background of the convict.
			<lb />
			Thus, the graver the offence and the longer the criminal
			<lb />
			record, the more severe is the punishment to be
			<lb />
			awarded. By laying emphasis on individualised justice,
			<lb />
			and shaping the result of the crime to the circumstances
			<lb />
			of the offender and the needs of the victim and
			<lb />
			community, restorative justice eschews uniformity of
			<lb />
			sentencing. Undue sympathy to impose inadequate
			<lb />
			sentence would do more harm to the public system to
			<lb />
			undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law
			<lb />
			and society could not long endure under serious threats.
			<lb />
			22. Ultimately, it becomes the duty of the courts to
			<lb />
			award proper sentence, having regard to the nature of
			<lb />
			the offence and the manner in which it was executed or
			<lb />
			committed, etc. The courts should impose a punishment
			<lb />
			befitting the crime so that the courts are able to
			<lb />
			accurately reflect public abhorrence of the crime. It is
			<lb />
			the nature and gravity of the crime, and not the criminal,
			<lb />
			which are germane for consideration of appropriate
			<lb />
			punishment in a criminal trial. Imposition of sentence
			<lb />
			without considering its effect on social order in many
			<lb />
			cases may be in reality, a futile exercise.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			509. On the measure of punishment, in (1991) 3 SCC 471,
			<lb />
			Sevaka Perumal &amp; Anr. v. State of Tamil Nadu, the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court status thus:
			<lb />
			-10. Therefore, undue sympathy to impose inadequate
			<lb />
			sentence would do more harm to the justice system to
			<lb />
			undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 384
			<lb />
			and society could not long endure under serious threats.
			<lb />
			If the courts did not protect the injured, the injured
			<lb />
			would then resort to private vengeance. It is, therefore,
			<lb />
			the duty of every court to award proper sentence having
			<lb />
			regard to the nature of the offence and the manner in
			<lb />
			which it was executed or committed etc.‖

			510. On this issue in (1994) 2 SCC 220, Dhananjoy Chatterjee v.
			<lb />
			State of West Bengal, the Supreme Court held thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-15. In our opinion, the measure of punishment in a
			<lb />
			given case must depend upon the atrocity of the crime;
			<lb />
			the conduct of the criminal and the defenceless and
			<lb />
			unprotected state of the victim. Imposition of
			<lb />
			appropriate punishment is the manner in which the
			<lb />
			courts respond to the society&apos;s cry for justice against the
			<lb />
			criminals. Justice demands that courts should impose
			<lb />
			punishment befitting the crime so that the courts reflect
			<lb />
			public abhorrence of the crime. The courts must not
			<lb />
			only keep in view the rights of the criminal but also the
			<lb />
			rights of the victim of crime and the society at large
			<lb />
			while
			<lb />
			considering
			<lb />
			imposition
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			appropriate
			<lb />
			punishment.‖

			<lb />
			court while assessing the adequacy of the sentence, in (2005) 8
			<lb />
			SCC 11, State v. Rajesh, the Supreme Court held thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-Any liberal attitude by imposing meagre sentences or
			<lb />
			taking too sympathetic a view merely on account of
			<lb />
			lapse of time or considerations personal to the accused
			<lb />
			only in respect of such offences will be resultwise
			<lb />
			counter productive in the long run and against societal
			<lb />
			interest which needs to be cared for and strengthened by
			<lb />
			the required string of deterrence inbuilt in the sentencing
			<lb />
			system. It is the nature and gravity of the crime but
			<lb />
			not the criminal, which are germane for consideration
			<lb />
			of appropriate sentence in a criminal trial.‖

		<p>
			512. In (2009) 11 SCC 737, R. Venkatakrishnan v. Central
			<lb />
			Bureau of Investigation, the Supreme Court held thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-168. A sentence of punishment in our opinion poses a
			<lb />
			complex problem which requires a balancing act
			<lb />
			between the competing views based on the reformative,
			<lb />
			the deterrent as well as the retributive theories of
			<lb />
			punishment. Accordingly, a just and proper sentence
			<lb />
			should neither be too harsh nor too lenient. In judging
			<lb />
			the adequacy of a sentence, the nature of the offence,
			<lb />
			the circumstances of its commission, the age and
			<lb />
			character of the offender, injury to individual or the
			<lb />
			society, effect of punishment on offender, are some
			<lb />
			amongst many other factors which should be ordinarily
			<lb />
			taken into consideration by the courts.‖

			513. Despite the anguish repeatedly expressed by the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court over decades, in the judgment reported at (2013) 11 SCC
			<lb />
			382, Soman v. State of Kerala, the Supreme Court has noted that
			<lb />
			not much has changed so far as the principles and guidelines for
			<lb />
			determination of sentences are concerned. In para 15 of the
			<lb />
			judgment, the court noted thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-15. Giving punishment to the wrongdoer is at the heart
			<lb />
			of the criminal justice delivery, but in our country, it is
			<lb />
			the weakest part of the administration of criminal
			<lb />
			justice. There are no legislative or judicially laid down
			<lb />
			guidelines to assist the trial court in meting out the just
			<lb />
			punishment to the accused facing trial before it after he is
			<lb />
			held guilty of the charges. In State of Punjab v. Prem
			<lb />
			Sagar, (2008) 7 SCC 550, this Court acknowledged as
			<lb />
			much and observed as under -
			<lb />
			-2. In our judicial system, we have not been able to
			<lb />
			develop legal principles as regards sentencing. The
			<lb />
			superior courts except making observations with
			<lb />
			regard to the purport and object for which
			<lb />
			punishment is imposed upon an offender, have not
			<lb />
			issued any guidelines. Other developed countries
			<lb />
			have done so. At some quarters, serious concerns
			<lb />
			have been expressed in this behalf. Some
			<lb />
			committees as for example Madhava Menon
			<lb />
			Committee and Malimath Committee have
			<lb />
			advocated introduction of sentencing guidelines.‖
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			514. Our attention is drawn to the judgment reported at (2013) 9
			<lb />
			SCC 516, Hazara Singh v. Raj Kumar &amp; Ors., (para 27), the very
			<lb />
			principles stated as back as in 1977 were reiterated by the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in the following terms:
			<lb />
			-17. We reiterate that in operating the sentencing system,
			<lb />
			law should adopt the corrective machinery or deterrence
			<lb />
			based on factual matrix. The facts and given
			<lb />
			circumstances in each case, the nature of the crime, the
			<lb />
			manner in which it was planned and committed, the
			<lb />
			motive for commission of the crime, the conduct of the
			<lb />
			accused, the nature of weapons used and all other
			<lb />
			attending circumstances are relevant facts which would
			<lb />
			enter into the area of consideration. We also reiterate that
			<lb />
			undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would
			<lb />
			do more harm to the justice system to undermine the
			<lb />
			public confidence in the efficacy of law. It is the duty of
			<lb />
			every court to award proper sentence having regard to the
			<lb />
			nature of the offence and the manner in which it was
			<lb />
			executed or committed. The court must not only keep in
			<lb />
			view the rights of the victim of the crime but also the
			<lb />
			society at large while considering the imposition of
			<lb />
			appropriate punishment.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)

		<p>
			515. So far as the various factors which ought to go into
			<lb />
			sentencing discretion are concerned, in Soman, the court placed
			<lb />
			reliance on writings of Professor Andrew Ashworth in Sentencing
			<lb />
			and Criminal Justice, 5 th Edition, Cambridge University Press,
			<lb />
			2010 holding as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;16. Nonetheless, if one goes through the decisions of
			<lb />
			this Court carefully, it would appear that this Court takes
			<lb />
			into account a combination of different factors while
			<lb />
			exercising
			<lb />
			discretion
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			sentencing,
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			is
			<lb />
			proportionality, deterrence, rehabilitation etc. (See:
			<lb />
			Ramashraya Chakravarti v. State of Madhya Pradesh,
			<lb />
			(1976) 1 SCC 281, Dhananjoy Chatterjee alias Dhana v.
			<lb />

			17. In a proportionality analysis, it is necessary to assess
			<lb />
			the seriousness of an offence in order to determine the
			<lb />
			commensurate punishment for the offender. The
			<lb />
			seriousness of an offence depends, apart from other
			<lb />
			things, also upon its harmfulness. The question is
			<lb />
			whether the consequences of the offence can be taken
			<lb />
			as the measure for determining its harmfulness? In
			<lb />
			addition, quite apart from the seriousness of the offence,
			<lb />
			can the consequences of an offence be a legitimate
			<lb />
			aggravating (as opposed to mitigating) factor while
			<lb />
			awarding a sentence. Thus, to understand the relevance
			<lb />
			of consequences of criminal conduct from a Sentencing
			<lb />
			standpoint, one must examine: (1) whether such
			<lb />
			consequences enhanced the harmfulness of the offence;
			<lb />
			and (2) whether they are an aggravating factor that
			<lb />
			need to be taken into account by the courts while
			<lb />
			deciding on the sentence.

			<lb />
			Cambridge University Press, 2010, Andrew Ashworth

			<lb />
			seriousness of an offence, as identified in a previous
			<lb />
			work by Andrew Von Hirsch and Nils Jareborg. (See

			516. The current position of sentencing policy is best summed up
			<lb />
			in the observations of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			in the judgment dated 2nd September, 2014 in
			<lb />
			W.P.(Crl.)No.77/2014, Mohd. Arif @ Ashfaq v. The Registrar,
			<lb />
			Supreme Court of India &amp; Ors.:

		</p>
		<item>
			30. xxx xxx xxx Crime and punishment are two
			<lb />
			sides of the same coin. Punishment must fit the crime.
			<lb />
			The notion of &apos;Just deserts&apos; or a sentence proportionate to
			<lb />
			the offender&apos;s culpability was the principle which, by
			<lb />
			passage of time, became applicable to criminal
			<lb />
			jurisprudence. It is not out of place to mention that in all
			<lb />
			of recorded history, there has never been a time when
			<lb />
			pg. 389
			<lb />
			crime and punishment have not been the subject of
			<lb />
			debate and difference of opinion. There are no statutory
			<lb />
			guidelines to regulate punishment. Therefore, in practice,
			<lb />
			there is much variance in the matter of sentencing. In
			<lb />
			many countries, there are laws prescribing sentencing
			<lb />
			guidelines, but there is no statutory sentencing policy in
			<lb />
			India. The IPC, prescribes only the maximum
			<lb />
			punishments for offences and in some cases minimum
			<lb />
			punishment is also prescribed. The Judges exercise wide
			<lb />
			discretion within the statutory limits and the scope for
			<lb />
			deciding the amount of punishment is left to the judiciary
			<lb />
			to reach decision after hearing the parties. However,
			<lb />
			what factors which should be considered while
			<lb />
			sentencing is not specified under law in any great detail.
			<lb />
			xxx xxx xxx&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			517. In Bachan Singh, the Constitution Bench noted that over
			<lb />
			standardization of the sentencing policy tends to defeat its very
			<lb />
			purpose and may actually produce opposite results and that it was
			<lb />
			neither practicable nor desirable to imprison the sentencing
			<lb />
			discretion of a judge in the strait-jacket of exhaustive and rigid
			<lb />
			standards. Nevertheless, the precedents on the issue show that it
			<lb />
			was not impossible to lay down broad guide-lines as distinguished
			<lb />
			from iron cased standards, which will minimise the risk of arbitrary
			<lb />
			imposition of death penalty for murder and some other offences
			<lb />
			under the Penal Code.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			518. The sentence is an amalgam of several factors including
			<lb />
			those relating to the crime as well as the criminal, circumstances
			<lb />
			mitigating aggravating or extenuating the offence. Deep concerns
			<lb />
			have been expressed on the lack of uniformity and equality in
			<lb />
			sentencing with regard to equally placed convicts because of there
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 390
			<lb />
			being no sentencing guidelines in place. The above narration
			<lb />
			would show that considerations of proportionality of punishment
			<lb />
			relating the sentence to the gravity of the crime, circumstances of
			<lb />
			the criminal, needs of the victim and the community emphasise the
			<lb />
			imperative requirement of individualized justice and sentencing
			<lb />
			discretion for the courts. That while broad guidelines could be laid
			<lb />
			down, it would not be proper (even if possible) to lay down rigid
			<lb />
			standards. Therefore, the aptness of a sentence must necessarily
			<lb />
			rest on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances of
			<lb />
			the individual cases.

			519. While Crl. Appeal Nos.910/2008 and 741/2008 and Crl.
			<lb />
			Rev.P.No.396/2008 were pending, on 24 th January, 2012,
			<lb />
			Crl.M.A.No.1168/2012 came to be filed in Crl.Rev.No.369/2008
			<lb />
			by Nilam Katara praying for a direction to the jail authorities as
			<lb />
			well as the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (&apos;AIIMS&apos; for
			<lb />
			brevity) to produce all records relating to the treatment of Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav including that to any other referral hospital for the entire
			<lb />
			period while he remained an under trial as well as upon conviction.
			<lb />
			In this application, it was pointed out that post conviction, Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav complained of illness whereupon he was taken to the Deen
			<lb />
			Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (&apos;DDU Hospital&apos; for brevity) and was
			<lb />
			diagnosed to be suffering from Tuberculosis.
			<lb />
			On the
			<lb />
			recommendation of Tihar Central Jail Hospital, he was referred to
			<lb />
			AIIMS on 6 th August, 2004, ostensibly for a second opinion. After
			<lb />
			his conviction, Vikas Yadav was alleged to have made 87 visits to
			<lb />
			hospitals, out of which 81 visits were to AIIMS alone. The
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 392
			<lb />
			complainant pointed out that the Jail Visiting Judge had passed an
			<lb />
			order dated 11 th November, 2008 permitting Vikas Yadav only to
			<lb />
			visit Tibia College and Hospital and the Maulana Azad Medical
			<lb />
			College. Despite this order, the jail authorities were taking Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav to AIIMS on their own accord. It was also submitted that
			<lb />
			there was no material that Vikas Yadav was suffering from any
			<lb />
			serious ailment for which the treatment required by Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
			was not available in the jail hospital, the DDU Hospital or other
			<lb />
			government hospitals. There was no material that it was only
			<lb />
			available in AIIMS.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			520. In addition, on 30 th January, 2012, the complainant filed
			<lb />
			Crl.M.A.No.1313/2012 in Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2012 complaining
			<lb />
			that information received under the Right to Information Act
			<lb />
			regarding medical treatment of Vishal Yadav has revealed that
			<lb />
			since his conviction and sentence, he has made 70 visits to the
			<lb />
			Batra Hospital and Medical Research Centre (‗Batra Hospital&apos; for
			<lb />
			brevity), out of which 40 were merely for ‗review&quot; while two were
			<lb />
			for the purpose ‗for needful&apos;. The applicant complained with
			<lb />
			regard to collusion between jail authorities, authorities at the Batra
			<lb />
			Hospital and Vishal Yadav to keep him out of Tihar jail in the
			<lb />
			luxurious rooms of the special/private wards of the Batra Hospital.
			<lb />
			The applicant pointed out that while admitted in Batra Hospital, by
			<lb />
			way of Crl.M.(Bail)No.157/2009 dated 15 th December, 2009
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav applied for interim bail from 14 th January, 2010 to
			<lb />
			31 st January, 2010 for his sister&apos;s marriage concealing the fact that
			<lb />
			he was not in hospital. In this background, the applicant sought a
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 393
			<lb />
			direction to the authorities of the Tihar jail and the Batra Hospital
			<lb />
			to furnish the treatment papers of the convict including referral
			<lb />
			papers for the period of his entire incarceration at the Tihar jail
			<lb />
			including the period of 2½ years when he was on bail as an under
			<lb />
			trial.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			521. Notice of Crl.M.A.No.1313/2012 was issued on 1 st February,
			<lb />
			2012 when the parties were required to produce the medical reports
			<lb />
			relating to the hospital visits of Vikas and Vishal Yadav in court.
			<lb />
			An officer from the jail conversant with the facts of the case was
			<lb />
			also required to appear before this court. The jail superintendent
			<lb />
			was also called upon to submit a list of other accused persons who
			<lb />
			had repeatedly visited hospitals other than DDU Hospital and
			<lb />
			LNJP Hospital, the jail referral hospitals, as well as the nature of
			<lb />
			their ailments.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			522. On the 2 nd of February 2012, notice was also issued of
			<lb />
			Crl.M.A.No.1168/2012 which was accepted by learned counsel for
			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav. In the order recorded on 2 nd February, 2012, we had
			<lb />
			noted that after 3 rd June, 2008, Vikas Yadav visited AIIMS 83
			<lb />
			times as per record which included visits for confirmation of
			<lb />
			tuberculosis. Notice was also taken of the expenses involved in
			<lb />
			taking the convicts to the hospitals. By the order of 2 nd February,
			<lb />
			2012 the jail authorities as well as AIIMS were directed to produce
			<lb />
			details of the expenditure incurred on their security, stay, treatment
			<lb />
			etc. The jail was also called upon to file on affidavit details of the
			<lb />
			consideration of the request for visiting AIIMS from the convict
			<lb />
			prior to the visits.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

			<lb />
			pg. 394
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			523. Keeping in view the stand of the convicts that they required
			<lb />
			continuous medical treatment, by the order dated 2 nd February,
			<lb />
			2012, we had also directed medical examinations of Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
			(on 9 th February, 2012) and Vishal Yadav (on 7 th February, 2012)
			<lb />
			at AIIMS to be conducted by a Board of experts (other than the
			<lb />
			doctors who had been associated in their examination/treatment of
			<lb />
			the convicts at any time earlier), to ascertain their medical status.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			524. Some records were produced by the AIIMS as well as Batra
			<lb />
			Hospital which, after getting certified copies prepared and issued,
			<lb />
			under our order dated 2nd March, 2012 have been kept in sealed
			<lb />
			cover in the safe custody of the Registrar (Appellate) of this court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			525. The anguish expressed by the complainant of the
			<lb />
			manipulations and connivance of the convicts with the jail
			<lb />
			authorities to secure the several outside hospitals visits was noted
			<lb />
			by us. It was essential to give opportunity to the defendants to
			<lb />
			place before us the medical records in their possession to support
			<lb />
			the treatment, hospital visits and admissions. Accordingly, by our
			<lb />
			order dated 16 th March, 2012, we had directed the State as well as
			<lb />
			the defendants to place on record the following:
			<lb />
			-(i) The rules/guidelines/policy(ies) which were in
			<lb />
			vogue with regard to manner in which permission was

			with regard to the admission in AIIMS in October, 2011 that the
			<lb />
			admission was justified and that Vikas Yadav had been diagnosed
			<lb />
			with Scheurman&apos;s disease D 11 -D 12 Vertebrae with Minimal
			<lb />
			Anterior Wedging. He has further relied on the report of AIIMS
			<lb />
			dated 20 th February, 2012 of AIIMS contending that it did not rule
			<lb />
			out the requirement of hospitalization in October, 2011. As
			<lb />
			regards 80 visits outside hospitals including AIIMS, he has
			<lb />
			submitted that the convict was in the custody of the State and was
			<lb />
			treated at par with other convicts. As regards stay in the private
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 396
			<lb />
			ward, it has been submitted that the convict was in the custody of
			<lb />
			the State and he had no choice but to go wherever he was sent for
			<lb />
			treatment and that he was shifted to the bigger room due to the
			<lb />
			security personnel.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			528. Thus full opportunity was given to the respondents/convicts
			<lb />
			to place documents/material as well as their explanation with
			<lb />
			regard to the medical treatment undertaken in outside hospitals and
			<lb />
			justification for these visits. The convicts were given opportunity
			<lb />
			also to disclose their medical condition and treatment prior to their
			<lb />
			arrests. A direction was also issued to AIIMS to explain the
			<lb />
			circumstances in which the ward of the convict -Vikas Yadav was
			<lb />
			shifted from ‗B&apos; Class private room to ‗A&apos; Class private room.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			529. On the 23 rd March 2012, we were informed by the State that
			<lb />
			prior to 10 th February, 2011, no guidelines had been formulated by
			<lb />
			the authorities with regard to referrals of Tihar jail inmates to
			<lb />
			outside hospitals. Learned counsel for the parties were also heard
			<lb />
			on the issue of costs involved during such visits. The importance
			<lb />
			of the issue was noted by us in paras 4 and 5 of the order which
			<lb />
			reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-4. The instant matter raises serious controversies
			<lb />
			with regard to the outside hospital visits of the
			<lb />
			respondent nos.2 &amp; 3. The very need for the
			<lb />
			referrals; the visits; their periodicity; and their
			<lb />
			duration has been strongly disputed before us.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			5.
			<lb />
			We are aware that medical science is not a
			<lb />
			definite science but it would be a travesty of justice if
			<lb />
			outside referrals of prisoners are made
			<lb />
			unwarrantedly and such visits facilitated at public
			<lb />
			expense. It is also grossly unfair if such outside
			<lb />
			referrals are sought/obtained utilizing the shield of
			<lb />
			non-existent medical condition(s). It also requires
			<lb />
			examination as to whether valuable medical facilities
			<lb />
			which are deficient have been misused and that too at
			<lb />
			public expense. Indulgence granted by the court or
			<lb />
			facilities provided by the jail authorities are not to be
			<lb />
			abused. Whenever jail and medical facilities have
			<lb />
			been misused by prisoners, be it as undertrials or as
			<lb />
			convicts, the matter is of serious concern. It is,
			<lb />
			therefore, necessary also to ascertain the culpability
			<lb />
			in this matter and fix the responsibility and initiate
			<lb />
			appropriate action against all including those remiss
			<lb />
			in the discharge of their duties.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			530. We had also noted in the order dated 23 rd March, 2012 that
			<lb />
			the court may not be competent to make an assessment of the
			<lb />
			gravity of the medical condition of any person or to assess the
			<lb />
			records received from the Batra Hospital and AIIMS. It was
			<lb />
			consequently deemed appropriate to appoint a committee of
			<lb />
			medical experts to facilitate the consideration and adjudication by
			<lb />
			us. Consequently, we had caused an independent assessment and
			<lb />
			evaluation of the medical condition of the two convicts based on
			<lb />
			the records produced by the hospitals, the material produced by
			<lb />
			the convicts and their examination, if deemed necessary, to be
			<lb />
			conducted by a Committee of relevant experts constituted by the
			<lb />
			Medical Superintendent, Army Research and Referral Hospital,
			<lb />
			Delhi Cantt. (‗Army Hospital&apos; hereafter) certified copies of the
			<lb />
			record was sent to the Army Hospital. The Committee was given
			<lb />
			opportunity to examine the records filed by the two hospitals in the
			<lb />
			court; and to seek production of the original record from this court.
			<lb />
			pg. 398
			<lb />
			The Committee was empowered to call any other records, seek
			<lb />
			appearance and make enquiries of the doctors or any of the
			<lb />
			personnel from AIIMS, Batra Hospital, DDU Hospital and Tihar
			<lb />
			jail for the purposes of making an objective evaluation. The
			<lb />
			committee of the Army Hospital was given liberty to permit the
			<lb />
			parties and/or counsels to assist in the scrutiny of the record and to
			<lb />
			assist it in the evaluation thereof. By our order dated 23 rd March,
			<lb />
			2012, the committee was required to submit a report within six
			<lb />
			weeks on the following aspects :
			<lb />
			-(a) the medical condition of Vikas Yadav and
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav for the period prior to January, 2012;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(b) the requirement of their outside referrals;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(c) the necessity of the hospital visit;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(d) the Committee shall give an opinion as to which
			<lb />
			of the hospital admissions was needed, as well as
			<lb />
			whether the durations thereof was justified under the
			<lb />
			circumstances or not;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(e) the Committee may report any period during the
			<lb />
			hospital visit/admission which was not spent in the
			<lb />
			hospital/hospital room.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			531. In order to enable this court to issue directions so that no
			<lb />
			under trial or convict is able to exercise undue influence or to
			<lb />
			persuade the jail authorities to take them on unnecessary outside
			<lb />
			hospital visits, by the order dated 17 th August, 2012, the Medical
			<lb />
			Superintendent, DDU Hospital and Director General, Tihar Jail
			<lb />
			was required to examine the availability of facilities at the jail
			<lb />
			hospitals and to submit a report to us.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			532. Pursuant to our directions dated 23rd March, 2012, the
			<lb />
			Medical Superintendent, Army Hospital appointed the following
			<lb />
			533. For the purposes of clarity, we propose to look at the
			<lb />
			hospital visits and admissions of the two convicts separately.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Hospital visits and admissions of Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			534. So far as Vikas Yadav is concerned, we are informed that he
			<lb />
			was brought to Tihar Jail on 9 th July, 1999 and remained there till
			<lb />
			27 th September, 1999 as an under trial in FIR No.287/1999 (known
			<lb />
			as the Jessica Lal murder case). He was thereafter brought on 16 th
			<lb />
			September, 2002 to the Central Jail, Tihar as an under trial in the
			<lb />
			case arising out of FIR No.192/2002, P.S. Kavi Nagar, Ghaziabad
			<lb />
			(present case) and has remained in jail ever since. He was
			<lb />
			convicted and sentenced on 30th May, 2008.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			535. The Superintendent, Central Jail No.4, Tihar has filed a
			<lb />
			status report dated 2 nd February, 2012 stating that Vikas Yadav&apos;s
			<lb />
			reference to AIIMS started in the year 2008 on account of an
			<lb />
			opinion dated 3 rd June, 2008 given by Medical Superintendent,
			<lb />
			DDU Hospital requiring him to be sent to AIIMS for further
			<lb />
			treatment of tuberculosis. Thereafter, the convict was being sent to
			<lb />
			AIIMS on the advice of the &quot;treating doctor&quot;. Further treatment in
			<lb />
			respect of an orthopaedic problem is also stated to have been
			<lb />
			suggested by the treating doctor at AIIMS. As per this status report
			<lb />
			dated 2 nd February, 2012, Vikas Yadav has visited AIIMS 83
			<lb />
			times.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			536. The complainant Nilam Katara has placed before us
			<lb />
			information received by her in response to her query under Right to
			<lb />
			Information Act that no supporting documentation is available of
			<lb />
			hospital visits of the convict Vikas Yadav. Ninety eight hospital
			<lb />
			visits between January, 2008 and 14 th December, 2011 have been
			<lb />
			tabulated therein which include visits to the DDU Hospital; AIIMS
			<lb />
			and the LNJP Hospital. In order to get a full picture, it is essential
			<lb />
			to set out the details thereof which read as follows :

			537. The above tabulation would show that Vikas Yadav has
			<lb />
			gone to the Department of Microbiology, AIIMS for sputum
			<lb />
			examination/for sputum examination and review/for sputum for
			<lb />
			AFB test/for sputum for AFB report collection on the 6 th and 7 th
			<lb />
			January, 2008; 8 th November, 2008. Then in the month of March,
			<lb />
			2009, he paid visits to this department on 3 rd ; 12 th , 13 th , 16 th and
			<lb />
			25 th March, 2009! It is inexplicable as to how so many visits to the
			<lb />
			Department of Microbiology at such short periods were necessary.
			<lb />
			He has visited the Medicine OPD at AIIMS at intervals of two
			<lb />
			weeks/for ‗fever&apos; and ‗cough&apos;. Vikas Yadav visited the Medicine
			<lb />
			OPD/DDU Hospital on 31 st May, 2008 then on 10 th June, 2008 and
			<lb />
			then the Chest Clinic/AIIMS on 22 nd August, two
			<lb />
			visits are recorded between 1 st June, 2008 to 2 nd September, 2011
			<lb />
			to Ortho, Dental and Chest departments of AIIMS; DDU hospital;
			<lb />
			Tibya College and Hospital; MAIDS for ‗needful&apos;. Similarly for
			<lb />
			the purposes of ‗for review&apos;, Vikas Yadav has gone 31 times to
			<lb />
			AIIMS. After visiting the Medicine OPD at AIIMS on 5 th August,
			<lb />
			2008, he visits the same department on 8 th , 13 th , and 20 th August,
			<lb />
			2008. In between, on the 7 th August, 2008, he visited Radiology
			<lb />
			OPD at AIIMS. Similarly Vikas Yadav has visited the Chest
			<lb />
			Clinic at AIIMS on 12 th September, 2008. In October and
			<lb />
			November, 2008, he visited the Chest Clinic at AIIMS on 10 th , 17 th ,
			<lb />
			31 st October, 2008 as well as 7 th and 14 th November, 2008. In
			<lb />
			January, 2009, he visited Chest Clinic on 9 th and 16 th January,
			<lb />
			2009. Again in February, 2009, he visited the Chest Clinic on 6 th ,
			<lb />
			11 th , 13 th , 14 th and 20 th February, 2009.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			538. If an ultrasound of the appellant had been done on 4 th June,
			<lb />
			2008, why was it repeated on 2 nd July, 2008? Three visits to the
			<lb />
			Orthopaedics OPD to AIIMS in less than a month from between
			<lb />
			11 th July, 2008 to 1 st August, 2008. In August, 2008, Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
			has visited one or the other department of AIIMS on the 1 st , 5 th , 7 th ,
			<lb />
			8 th , 13, 20 th , 22 nd , 25 th and 27 th August, 2008.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			539. In almost every month, the convict has had repeated outings
			<lb />
			out of jail. If the convict was being treated in the medicine, chest
			<lb />
			and orthopaedics of AIIMS, where was the need for him to go to
			<lb />
			Tibitia hospital as well. For dental treatment, the convict was
			<lb />
			visiting MAIDS as well as AIIMS. He visited the orthopaedic
			<lb />
			department of AIIMS three times within 10 days (3 rd , 4 th and 13 th
			<lb />
			May, 2009). He goes for physiotherapy to AIIMS on 16 th May,
			<lb />
			2009. He has got MRI of the left knee and X-rays done in the
			<lb />
			radiology department of LNJP Department on 20 th , 25 th and 26 th
			<lb />
			August, 2011. He is taken to the LNJP Hospital for collection of
			<lb />
			the MRI report on 29 th August, 2011. Is it possible to have three
			<lb />
			MRIs of the left knee undertaken in six days? And even if he had
			<lb />
			to visit AIIMS, could not the visits to the various departments be
			<lb />
			combined in a single visit to AIIMS?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			540. No details of the treatment in these OPD visits of Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav have been provided either by Vikas Yadav, the jail
			<lb />
			authorities or hospital authorities including AIIMS.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			541. The above tabulation would amply establish the fact that he
			<lb />
			was being taken outside the Tihar jail for minor complaints -
			<lb />
			‗fever, cough&apos; at short intervals without any justification. There is
			<lb />
			not an iota of supporting material to suggest that Vikas Yadav was
			<lb />
			suffering from such sickness or at least a major illness which could
			<lb />
			not be treated at the jail hospital or DDU, LNJP. There would
			<lb />
			certainly be no occasion for visiting a super speciality referral
			<lb />
			hospital as AIIMS at such short intervals. The information shows
			<lb />
			that he has been taken out of jail for the -needful‖. What was the
			<lb />
			needful and what was done? Where was the need for the convict to
			<lb />
			visit the hospital to get a date for CECT or to collect a MRI report
			<lb />
			or any other report?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			542. A discharge summary dated 4 th November, 2011 recorded by
			<lb />
			AIIMS for Vikas Yadav&apos;s admission from 10 th October, 2011 to 4 th
			<lb />
			November, 2011 also discloses another interesting fact. Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav was diagnosed with Pulmonary TB in 2008 for which &quot;he
			<lb />
			took ATT for 4.5 months (stopped by self with symptomatic
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 406
			<lb />
			improvement)&quot;. The above noting in the discharge summary
			<lb />
			manifests that either Vikas Yadav did not contract tuberculosis at
			<lb />
			all (there being no record of medication) or that he was &quot;cured‖
			<lb />
			within 4½ months of the commencement of anti T.B. treatment, if
			<lb />
			at all he took any!
			<lb />
			The discharge summary also establishes that between 2008
			<lb />
			till middle of 2011, Vikas Yadav was a healthy person without
			<lb />
			tuberculosis and there was no real need for the hospital visits to
			<lb />
			AIIMS of Vikas Yadav pursuant to the recommendation dated 3 rd
			<lb />
			June, 2008 of Medical Superintendent, DDU Hospital for this
			<lb />
			disease.
			<lb />
			We may also note that there is no record at all with regard to
			<lb />
			the infection and treatment for tuberculosis, if Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
			actually had the disease or underwent treatment for it or was it
			<lb />
			really an enabling excuse used as a shield to get out of the prison?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			543. In the communication dated 15 th February, 2012, of the
			<lb />
			Senior Medical Officer, as per medical records the following
			<lb />
			details of medication which was advised to Vikas Yadav during his
			<lb />
			different hospital visits:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;(i) Tab. Shelcal -CT
			<lb />
			(ii) Volitra Gel -Locally
			<lb />
			(iii) Tab. Nimulid
			<lb />
			(iv) Tab. Nervemax
			<lb />
			(v) Tab. Ultra Cet
			<lb />
			(vi) Tab. Altraday
			<lb />
			(vii) Tab. Zinase -D
			<lb />
			(viii) Cap. Becousule&quot;
			<lb />
			While &apos;Shelcal&apos; is a calcium supplement, &apos;Nervemax&apos; is a
			<lb />
			nerve vitamin; &apos;Nimulid&apos;, &apos; Ultracet&apos;, &apos;Altraday&apos;, &apos;Zinase-D&apos; are pain
			<lb />
			killers; &apos;Becousule&apos; a vitamin supplement, while &apos;Volitra gel&apos; is an
			<lb />
			ointment for pain relief.
			<lb />
			The above medication also does not point towards any
			<lb />
			disease requiring visits to a super speciality referral hospital as
			<lb />
			AIIMS.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			544. Pursuant to our order dated 2 nd February, 2012, Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
			and Vishal Yadav were medically examined by a Board of the
			<lb />
			following five specialists and super specialists of AIIMS in the
			<lb />
			relevant medical disciplines:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Dr. S. Wadhwa, Professor, Deptt. of P.M.R.
			<lb />
			(ii) Dr. A. Jayaswal, Professor, Deptt. of Orthopaedics.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii) Dr. S. Chumber, Professor, Deptt. of Surgery.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv) Dr. Navneet Vig, Addl. Professor, Deptt. of Medicine.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(v) Dr. I.B. Singh, Addl. Professor, Hosp. Admn.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			545. The Board examined Vikas Yadav on 9 th 10 th and 13 th
			<lb />
			February, 2012; scrutinized the entire medical record relating to
			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav; took a detailed clinical history as well as physical
			<lb />
			examination of Vikas Yadav and opined as follows:
			<lb />
			-Final conclusion and Recommendations of the
			<lb />
			Medical Board:
			<lb />
			Based on the information obtained by review of medical
			<lb />
			reports shown by the jail authorities, detailed history
			<lb />
			and findings of the clinical examination plus relevant
			<lb />
			investigations, it is reported that Sh. Vikas Yadav is able
			<lb />
			to perform all the activities of daily living without
			<lb />
			assistance and is currently not suffering from any acute
			<lb />
			or severe medical condition which requires
			<lb />
			hospitalization or active intervention -medical surgical
			<lb />
			or investigational.
			<lb />
			His current condition can be
			<lb />
			managed by taking appropriate care and medications.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			546. The Board of experts at AIIMS has reported that Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav was not suffering from any acute medical condition. Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav was procuring his own medication and would be possessed
			<lb />
			of the records in this regard. Nothing has been produced to support
			<lb />
			that he actually took any medication. The medication prescribed
			<lb />
			would also establish that Vikas Yadav was not suffering from any
			<lb />
			major sickness necessitating visits to a super speciality hospital.
			<lb />
			For all these reasons, we have no hesitation in holding that the
			<lb />
			hospital visits and admission were not necessary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			547. As per the status report dated 2 nd February, 2012 of the
			<lb />
			Superintendent, Central Jail No.4, Tihar, between 5 th July, 2010 to
			<lb />
			2 nd February, 2012, apart from hospital visits, Vikas Yadav had
			<lb />
			additionally left the jail for court appearances on 15 occasions (5 th
			<lb />
			July, 2010, 1 st September, 2010, 1 st October, 2010, 9 th November,
			<lb />
			2010, 4 th January, 2011, 7 th February, 2011, 3 rd March, 2011, 2 nd
			<lb />
			May, 2011, 13 th May, 2011, 1 st June, 2011, 14 th June, 2011, 8 th
			<lb />
			July, 2011, 1 st August, 2011, 12 th August, 2011, 5 th September,
			<lb />
			2011). The report states that for this purpose, the convict was
			<lb />
			handed over to the DAP authorities a day prior to the court date
			<lb />
			and was admitted back after attending the date. The convict was
			<lb />
			sent for custody parole on 14 th April, 2011 and 29 th /30 th April,
			<lb />
			2011.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			548. It is manifest from the above discussion that visits to the
			<lb />
			hospital have been utilised by the prisoner to procure outings from
			<lb />
			the jail. These visits were unnecessary and not for any medical
			<lb />
			reason, in any case not for any serious ailment which could not be
			<lb />
			treated at an ordinary facility.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) Admission in AIIMS of Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			549. Amongst the several visits to AIIMS, on 1 st October, 2011,
			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav visited the Department of Radiology, AIIMS for a
			<lb />
			CAT scan of the left thigh. On 3 rd October, 2011, he visited the
			<lb />
			Orthopaedic department of AIIMS for review and again visited
			<lb />
			AIIMS on 7 th October, 2011 when he was advised admission in
			<lb />
			AIIMS (private ward) for evaluation of MRI of left thigh, bone
			<lb />
			scan and possible PET-CT scan. We are appalled to note the advice
			<lb />
			of admission for -evaluation‖ of an MRI and a bone scan. Let us
			<lb />
			examine the events which transpired as a result of this advice.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			550. On 10 th October, 2011, Vikas Yadav was admitted to AIIMS
			<lb />
			for undergoing a PET-CT scan. Initially he was placed in a &apos;B&apos;
			<lb />
			Class room in the private ward but immediately thereafter, was
			<lb />
			shifted to an &apos;A&apos; Class luxury room. He was discharged on the 4 th
			<lb />
			of November, 2011 without any PET Scan having been conducted
			<lb />
			or any diagnosis being made. During this period, neither any test
			<lb />
			was done nor any treatment was provided to him.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			551. The office of the Superintendent, Central Jail No.3 under
			<lb />
			covering letter No.F.3/SCJ-3/ASW/2014/2473 dated 8 th December,
			<lb />
			2014 has placed the medical report submitted by the Medical
			<lb />
			Officer Incharge, Central Jail No.3 Dispensary in respect of Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav before us. The photocopy of outdoor patient tickets of the
			<lb />
			Central Jail Hospital which have been placed shows that Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav attended the Radiology Department of the LNJP Hospital on
			<lb />
			26 th August, 2011 when he had got an MRI as well as X-rays done
			<lb />
			which was received by him on 30 th August, 2011. The referral of
			<lb />
			the orthopaedic department of AIIMS on 1 st September, 2011 gives
			<lb />
			no reason or aggravation in any medical condition. After the MRI
			<lb />
			in LNJP, Vikas Yadav visited the AIIMS on 16th September, 2011
			<lb />
			to get his MRI undertaken. Why was this necessary?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			552. Interestingly, the record of the Central Jail No.4 also shows
			<lb />
			that Vikas Yadav was being taken to the Radiology Department of
			<lb />
			the LNJP Hospital earlier. No reason as to why the SCAN could
			<lb />
			not be performed in any other Governments Hospital which he was
			<lb />
			visiting is forthcoming. There is no recommendation, referral,
			<lb />
			evaluation, approval or authorization by the jail medical experts or
			<lb />
			the DDU Hospital for this reference or admission.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			553. The discharge summary dated 4 th November, 2011 records
			<lb />
			the diagnosis as &quot;suspected Sheurman&apos;s disease&quot;. The medical
			<lb />
			record shows that the treatment which was prescribed for Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav by AIIMS on 4 th November, 2011 was as follows:
			<lb />
			-(i) Physiotherapy &amp; mobilization
			<lb />
			(ii) T-Nervemax 75 mg BD
			<lb />
			(iii) T-Utracet 1TDS x 5 days
			<lb />
			(iv) T-Pan -40 1BD
			<lb />
			(v) Incentive spirometry 2 hrsly, steam inhalation 6
			<lb />
			hrsly.‖
			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav was thus prescribed a nerve vitamin (T-
			<lb />
			Nervemax); a pain killer (Ultra-cet) and an anti-acid (TPan) during
			<lb />
			and after his hospitalisation. It is evident from the above that there
			<lb />
			was no such medical condition requiring treatment by a super-
			<lb />
			speciality hospital as AIIMS, let alone admission for twenty six
			<lb />
			days.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			554. In its report of proceedings dated 14 th June, 2012, on this
			<lb />
			admission to AIIMS from 10 th October to 4 th November, 2011, the
			<lb />
			Army Hospital Committee has noted the following:
			<lb />
			-3. The Board, having perused all the medical
			<lb />
			records produced before it has come to the following
			<lb />
			conclusions:-
			<lb />
			(a) Mr. Vikas Yadav was diagnosed to have
			<lb />
			Pulmonary Tuberculosis in 2008. He received anti-
			<lb />
			Tubercular treatment for a period of 04 to 05 months
			<lb />
			and stopped it on his own. Details of the basis of
			<lb />
			diagnosis and drugs administered are not available in
			<lb />
			the documents provided.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(b) He was admitted at AIIMS with effect from 10
			<lb />
			Oct 2011 to 04 Nov 2011 for low backache and pain
			<lb />
			left knee joint. His final diagnosis and detailed
			<lb />
			observations of the Board are recorded as per
			<lb />
			Appendix ‗A&apos; to this report.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(c) The PET-CT Scan of the spine was carried out at
			<lb />
			a later date i.e. FDG/18725/11 dated 07/12/11, and this
			<lb />
			did not reveal any abnormality.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(d) The available records offer no information
			<lb />
			about OPD visits of Mr. Vikas Yadav.‖

		<p>

			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav at AIIMS from 10 th October, 2011 (for 26 days), his

			<lb />
			with Minimal Anterior Wedging. The Board additionally made the
			<lb />
			following remarks:
			<lb />
			-(a) Admitted for complaints of Low Backache and
			<lb />
			pain (Lt) Knee joint. MRI done. Revealed only
			<lb />
			degenerative changes in dorsal vertebrae.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) Made good clinical recovery on conservative
			<lb />
			treatment and physiotherapy. Admission was justified
			<lb />
			for evaluation, observation and treatment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(c) A PET-CT Scan was advised and jail authorities
			<lb />
			were asked to provide money for the same. Inordinate
			<lb />
			delay was experienced in obtaining the money. Hence,
			<lb />
			hospital stay got prolonged. Ultimately, patient was
			<lb />
			discharged without carrying out the scan. The scan
			<lb />
			was done on 07 Dec 2011 on outpatient basis, and
			<lb />
			reported normal.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(d) As per hospital records, Mr. Vikas Yadav was
			<lb />
			reported to be absent from his hospital bed on two
			<lb />
			separate occasions on the night of 26/27 Oct 2011. The
			<lb />
			first absence was from 08.30 PM to 12.00 AM and the
			<lb />
			second from 00.45 AM to 06.00 AM. The matter was
			<lb />
			reported by the ward sister to the resident doctor on
			<lb />
			duty, who further informed the Ward in-charge of Ortho
			<lb />
			ward and the Nursing supervisor, and endorsed the same
			<lb />
			in the case notes maintained in the ward.‖

		<p>
			556. We are pained to note that the Army Hospital (R&amp;R)
			<lb />
			Committee has merely extracted the expressions (&quot;justified&quot;,
			<lb />
			&quot;advised&quot;) used in the other hospital from the records placed
			<lb />
			before it without recording its independent opinion. -Degenerative
			<lb />
			changes‖ would be a result of passage of time and aging which
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 413
			<lb />
			every person undergoes. No hospitalisation was recommended for
			<lb />
			this condition. It is left to this court to draw its conclusions from
			<lb />
			the noted facts and circumstances.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			557. From the above disclosures, it also appears that Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
			was either not afflicted with tuberculosis or the infection was so
			<lb />
			minimal that it could be cured without the standard medication
			<lb />
			regime for the disease.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			558. As per the department of Orthopaedics of AIIMS, Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav was &quot;complaining of pain in the left upper thigh and had
			<lb />
			acute back pain which had worsened over the last few weeks&quot;. The
			<lb />
			discharge summary issued by the AIIMS to Vikas Yadav on the 4 th
			<lb />
			of November, 2011 records that the patient was complaining of low
			<lb />
			backache and pain in left thigh for four months! It would appear
			<lb />
			that this back pain got cured without any medical intervention. The
			<lb />
			record of AIIMS thus establishes that there was no emergency and
			<lb />
			no acute condition critically requiring the PET scan or requiring his
			<lb />
			hospitalization for the purposes of taking the SCAN.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			559. After our order dated 4 th February, 2012, a communication
			<lb />
			No.SMO/CJ-4/2012/2350 dated 15 th February, 2012 has been sent
			<lb />
			by the Medical Officer Incharge, Central Jail No.4, Tihar to the
			<lb />
			Superintendent, Central Jail No.4, Tihar which has been placed on
			<lb />
			record to explain this admission. So far as the reference of Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav to the AIIMS is concerned, the manner and reasons therefor,
			<lb />
			stated in this communication dated 15 th February, 2012 read thus:
			<lb />
			-As per medical record the patient was referred to DDU
			<lb />
			hospital in Aug-2011 for evaluation and Management of
			<lb />
			pain in Lt. Knee. The Doctors of DDU hospital referred
			<lb />
			the patient to AIIMS Deptt. of Orthopedics on
			<lb />
			30.08.2011 for opinion regarding his knee pain/need for
			<lb />
			arthroscopy (Annexure 1). There after the inmate was
			<lb />
			referred to AIIMS Deptt. of orthopaedics for further
			<lb />
			evaluation/Management/follow up as per the advice of
			<lb />
			treating Doctor. The inmate refused to take any
			<lb />
			medicines from CJ-4 Dispensary as he is taking the
			<lb />
			medicines on his own as stated by the inmate. The
			<lb />
			details of visits to outside hospitals as per medical
			<lb />
			record is enclosed (page No. 1 to 6). As per Medical
			<lb />
			Record he was treated for tubercular Lymphadenopathy
			<lb />
			in 2008 (ATT started on 06.06.2008 and stopped in
			<lb />
			November/December, 2008).
			<lb />
			His PET -CT Scan conducted at AIIMS on dated
			<lb />
			07.12.2011 reveals -No definite evidence of any active
			<lb />
			disease.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			560. As per an affidavit dated 22 nd February, 2012 filed by
			<lb />
			Medical Superintendent, AIIMS, &quot;the issue of non-receipt of
			<lb />
			payment of charges of PET-CT from the jail authorities became the
			<lb />
			reason of continuing his admission in AIIMS&quot;. What was the
			<lb />
			emergency for admission (if required) without even receipt of
			<lb />
			charges for the scan, if it was not a mere shield for facilitating him
			<lb />
			in staying outside prison. And if funds were the sole reason for
			<lb />
			keeping Vikas Yadav in hospital, we fail to understand as to why
			<lb />
			he was discharged at all without undertaking such PET?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) Change of room category
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			561. The payment record submitted by AIIMS shows that Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav was put in a ‗B&apos; Class private room on 10 th October, 2011.
			<lb />
			He was shifted to ‗A&apos; Class (Deluxe) room on 11 th October, 2011.
			<lb />
			What is the difference between &apos;A&apos; Class deluxe room and the ‗B&apos;
			<lb />
			Class private rooms? This is disclosed in para 4 of the affidavit of
			<lb />
			the Medical Superintendent, AIIMS dated 21 st March, 2012 which
			<lb />
			reads as follows:
			<lb />
			-4. That the difference between A type &amp; B type
			<lb />
			rooms is primarily of the size since both type of rooms
			<lb />
			are single seater rooms with attached toilet. The size
			<lb />
			of B class room in old private ward is approx. 26 sq.
			<lb />
			mtr. and size of A class room in new pvt. ward is
			<lb />
			approx. 32 sq. mtr. Therefore there is only marginal
			<lb />
			difference of size in these two types of rooms.‖
			<lb />
			Thus the ‗B&apos; class rooms are the ‗old&apos;, while ‗A&apos; class rooms
			<lb />
			are in the ‗new&apos; private ward of AIIMS. The difference between
			<lb />
			the two is in the size and charges for the room.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			562. The affidavit makes a further very interesting disclosure. In
			<lb />
			para 5 of this affidavit, the Medical Superintendent has disclosed
			<lb />
			the following information as the reason for keeping a patient in the
			<lb />
			‗A&apos; Type or ‗B&apos; type private room:
			<lb />
			-5. That since the old private ward is located within
			<lb />
			the main hospital building, and as a matter of precaution
			<lb />
			from the patient care point of view relatively serious
			<lb />
			patients (who are more sick) are preferably kept/
			<lb />
			admitted in the old pvt. ward, since it is easier for the
			<lb />
			doctor to reach on being called as &amp; when required and
			<lb />
			likelihood of doctor being called SOS is more in case(s)
			<lb />
			of relatively seriously ill patients than stable patients.
			<lb />
			The ICU&apos;s (Intensive Care Unit) &amp; HDU&apos;s (High
			<lb />
			Dependency Units) and other centralized facilities like
			<lb />
			radio-diagnosis &amp; operation threatres are also located in
			<lb />
			the Main Hospital Building, which is attached with the
			<lb />
			Old Pvt. Ward. The relatively sick patient as and when
			<lb />
			required can be very easily shifted to the ICU/HDU/OT
			<lb />
			if required, whereas it is not only time taking but at time
			<lb />
			difficult as well for the relatively sick patient to be
			<lb />
			shifted to ICU/HDU/OT, without loss of time, as it take
			<lb />
			some time for the shifting of the patient from the New
			<lb />
			Pvt. Ward. The relatively less serious or stable patients
			<lb />
			are preferably kept admitted in new private ward since
			<lb />
			likelihood of urgently calling doctor on duty are less in
			<lb />
			such patients.‖
			<lb />
			(Underlining by us)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			563. In para 5, the Medical Superintendent has admitted that
			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav was shifted to the ‗A&apos; Class room for the reason that
			<lb />
			he was a stable patient whose possibility of urgently requiring a
			<lb />
			doctor on duty was much less. It is also stated that the
			<lb />
			transfer/shifting of Vikas Yadav was done in -routine manner‖ as
			<lb />
			per above practice without any consideration of his being a
			<lb />
			prisoner and without reference to the jail authorities. It clearly
			<lb />
			establishes that Vikas Yadav was a stable patient for whom the
			<lb />
			likelihood of requiring urgent medical care was less, so he could be
			<lb />
			kept away from the centralized facilities at AIIMS. The Medical
			<lb />
			Superintendent, AIIMS has also explained that ‗B&apos; Type rooms are
			<lb />
			more in demand. Judicial notice requires to be taken of the long
			<lb />
			line of critically ill patients waiting to be admitted to the AIIMS for
			<lb />
			treatment in any ward. And yet a healthy prisoner has been
			<lb />
			permitted to occupy and room for twenty six days thereby enabling
			<lb />
			him to avoid the prison.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			564. This court had directed information with regard to private
			<lb />
			ward hospitalization of other prisoners in AIIMS. In this regard, in
			<lb />
			para 8 of the affidavit dated 21 st March, 2012 of the Medical
			<lb />
			Superintendent, it is disclosed thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-8. As regards pvt. ward hospitalization of other
			<lb />
			prisoner patients, it is informed that several jail patients
			<lb />
			have been given the facility of private ward
			<lb />
			hospitalization on the advice of the treating/consulting
			<lb />
			doctors only in the past as well including Sh. Pappu
			<lb />
			Yadav, Dr. Ketan Desai and Sh. Amar Singh.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			9.
			<lb />
			The jail inmate patient Sh. Amar singh was
			<lb />
			initially admitted in new private ward in Room
			<lb />
			No.2018, A type room on 12.9.2011 and was later
			<lb />
			shifted to Old Private Ward 14.09.2011 in Room
			<lb />
			No.301 A type room on account of need of regular
			<lb />
			monitoring required in view of his illness.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			565. Since a question has been raised as to the authority with
			<lb />
			which the hospital shifted the convict to ‗A&apos; class room, in para 10
			<lb />
			of the affidavit, AIIMS has sought to take the shield that the
			<lb />
			admission was effected only after the payment was received from
			<lb />
			the jail and because the jail made such payment, it was with their
			<lb />
			approval. Given this statement that room change was effected only
			<lb />
			after receipt of payment from the jail, AIIMS explanation that
			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav was kept admitted as payment for the PET was
			<lb />
			awaited is unbelievable, to say the least. This conduct on the part
			<lb />
			of the jail authorities (if they paid for the ‗A&apos; class deluxe room
			<lb />
			and not for the SCAN) and AIIMS reeks of the collusion with the
			<lb />
			prisoner to enable his stay in comfort outside of jail.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			566. PET-CT scans ordinarily do not require admission into
			<lb />
			hospital, unless there is a medical condition of the patent requiring
			<lb />
			his admission. The most telling circumstance which establishes
			<lb />
			beyond doubt that the hospitalization from 10 th October, 2011 to 4 th
			<lb />
			November, 2011 for undergoing the PET scan was completely
			<lb />
			unwarranted is the fact that the PET-CT scan of Vikas Yadav was
			<lb />
			not done even in his AIIMS visit on 28 th November, 2011 for the
			<lb />
			same purpose. It was done only on 7 th December, 2011 as an out
			<lb />
			patient i.e. almost two months after his admission on 10 th October,
			<lb />
			2011 which did not reveal any abnormality. This establishes
			<lb />
			beyond doubt the fact that there was no urgency in getting the scan
			<lb />
			and certainly no requirement Vikas Yadav&apos;s for hospital admission,
			<lb />
			let alone for a hospital stay of twenty six days.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(c) Absence of Vikas Yadav from hospital room on 23 rd October,
			<lb />
			2011, night of 26 th /27 th October, 2011 and 1 st November,
			<lb />
			2011.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			567. Apart from the sheer number of the hospital visits (more
			<lb />
			than 100) out of which 83 visits were to AIIMS, an extremely
			<lb />
			serious and important aspect of the matter is the fact that Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav was found missing from his hospital room on three
			<lb />
			occasions while admitted in ‗A&apos; class room of the private ward in
			<lb />
			AIIMS between 10 th October, 2011 to 4 th November, 2011.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			568. No dispute has been raised by or on behalf of the convict to
			<lb />
			the record produced by AIIMS. From the original record produced
			<lb />
			by AIIMS, Mr. P.K. Dey, learned counsel for the complainant has
			<lb />
			police constables. There was not any
			<lb />
			information to the sisters, neither any
			<lb />
			written permission, the case was
			<lb />
			informed to the ward incharge Ortho-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			II&quot;
			<lb />
			Patient came back at 12 midnight and
			<lb />
			wrote in sister&apos;s chart that he went out
			<lb />
			at 10.30 to some doctor&apos;s hostel and
			<lb />
			came back at 12 midnight, but as per
			<lb />
			one of his attendants he had gone to
			<lb />
			meet one of his known to who is
			<lb />
			admitted in CN Centre.
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			27.10.11 :
			<lb />
			(Diwali
			<lb />
			festival)
			<lb />
			At 12:45 a.m. the patient again went
			<lb />
			out of the room without any
			<lb />
			information. On asking the patient as
			<lb />
			well as the police constable they refused
			<lb />
			to tell any rather the constable on duty
			<lb />
			told the sister on duty that the &quot;Patient
			<lb />
			is under our custody, it is our
			<lb />
			responsibility regarding the patient not
			<lb />
			yours&quot;
			<lb />
			Informed to supervisor and ward
			<lb />
			incharge Ortho-II as well.
			<lb />
			On inspection the room was locked
			<lb />
			from outside the patient did not report
			<lb />
			till morning he was first seen on the
			<lb />
			morning only at 6 am when the police
			<lb />
			constable came for the keys.
			<lb />
			Morning Round:
			<lb />
			As per the police constable outside, the
			<lb />
			patient was sleeping inside the room
			<lb />
			hence was not disturbed.
			<lb />
			Night incidents were explained to
			<lb />
			Professor S. Rastogi and Dr. S.A. Khan
			<lb />
			28.10.11 : On inquiry about PET Ct Scan the money
			<lb />
			is yet to come (none of the attendants
			<lb />
			neither the police constables were clearly
			<lb />
			talking about the matter)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			31.10.11 : 10 PM, No entry in Nurses daily
			<lb />
			record.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			01.11.11
			<lb />
			At 6 AM not found on bed. Informed
			<lb />
			to Ortho-II, Patient came back at 7.15
			<lb />
			AM. (as per daily Nurses daily record)
			<lb />
			02.11.11: On enquiry about charge for PET CT
			<lb />
			money is still to be issued from the jail as
			<lb />
			told by the patient himself. Such answers
			<lb />
			were given previously also on several
			<lb />
			occasions. Today he told that the money
			<lb />
			will be sanctioned by tomorrow.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			569. It is pointed out to us that the 27 th of October, 2011 was
			<lb />
			Diwali.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			570. Mr. Sumeet Verma, learned counsel for Vikas Yadav has
			<lb />
			orally submitted that Vikas Yadav had gone to visit some doctor
			<lb />
			friend in the AIIMS hostel. No details of such friend are disclosed.
			<lb />
			No information was given to the doctor or nurse on duty. The
			<lb />
			information given is to the contrary.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			571. Another absence is explained by Mr. Verma as a prescription
			<lb />
			walk as part of Vikas Yadav&apos;s physiotherapy regime. We find this
			<lb />
			explanation completely unacceptable. It is not supported by any
			<lb />
			hospital record. Furthermore, no person would undertake a walk as
			<lb />
			part of physiotherapy in the middle of the night. Also why was
			<lb />
			such walk taken on the night of Diwali alone and on no other
			<lb />
			night? Again no intimation thereof was given to any authority.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			572. It cannot be disputed that if the hospital stay was warranted,
			<lb />
			the convict was required to restrict his movement to the hospital
			<lb />
			room. Instead, he has been found missing on the several occasions
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 422
			<lb />
			as noted in the original record of case sheets by the medical
			<lb />
			authorities on duty.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			573. It would appear that after the hospital visits were
			<lb />
			highlighted, the Delhi Police has taken the matter seriously. Head
			<lb />
			Constable Ishwar Singh and Constable Ramesh Kumar had been
			<lb />
			detailed to ensure the proper care and custody of the convict in the
			<lb />
			AIIMS on the dates in question. In view of these absences of the
			<lb />
			convict from the hospital room, the police treated the same as
			<lb />
			misconduct on the part of these two police officials who were
			<lb />
			placed under suspension vide an office order dated 27 th March,
			<lb />
			2012 and subjected to a disciplinary inquiry. The inquiry officer,
			<lb />
			Inspector Rajeshwar Aggarwal conducted the inquiry in which six
			<lb />
			witnesses which included the doctors and nursing sisters at the
			<lb />
			AIIMS were examined. Based on the evidence recorded during the
			<lb />
			inquiry, the inquiry officer recorded his findings that the charges
			<lb />
			against the Head Constable Ishwar Singh and Constable Ramesh
			<lb />
			Kumar were fully substantiated beyond any shadow or doubt. The
			<lb />
			disciplinary authority caused a copy of the report of the inquiry
			<lb />
			officer to be served upon the police officials on 24 th July, 2012.
			<lb />
			After considering their joint reply and hearing the defaulters on 3 rd
			<lb />
			August, 2012, the disciplinary authority inter alia held as follows :
			<lb />
			-I have carefully gone through the depositions made by
			<lb />
			the PWs as well as relied upon documentary evidence.
			<lb />
			The pleas taken by the defaulters are devoid of
			<lb />
			substance. The contentions raised by the defaulters in
			<lb />
			their defense statement have been discussed by the
			<lb />
			Enquiry Officer at length in his finding.
			<lb />
			XXX The plea of the defaulters that they were present
			<lb />
			when checked by Inspr. Vimal Kishor at 11.50 PM is
			<lb />
			devoid of merit as the main charge against them was
			<lb />
			that they were not found present in the ward between
			<lb />
			12.45 AM to 6.00 AM on the night between
			<lb />
			26/27.10.2011.
			<lb />
			XXX The claim of the defaulters that they did not
			<lb />
			remain in collusion and facilitate the convict has no legs
			<lb />
			to stand as from the overall evidence and relied upon
			<lb />
			documents it is clearly proved that convict Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
			and both the defaulters were not present in the ward
			<lb />
			room from 12.45 AM to 6.00 AM on the intervening
			<lb />
			night of 26/27.10.2011.
			<lb />
			XXX It has been proved in the departmental enquiry
			<lb />
			that both the defaulters had taken out the convict Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav from the ward room of A.I.I.M.S. to an unknown
			<lb />
			place and were not found present alongwith the convict
			<lb />
			from 12.45 AM to 6.00 AM of the intervening night of
			<lb />
			26/27.10.2011 as is evident from the stamen of PW-3 as
			<lb />
			well as other corroborating statements of other PWs.
			<lb />
			XXX The defaulters, being police officers were
			<lb />
			expected to perform their duty strictly as per rules which
			<lb />
			required of them to ensure proper care and custody of
			<lb />
			convict Vikas Yadav. Instead of doing, so, they
			<lb />
			remained in collusion with the convict and provided him
			<lb />
			undue and illegal favours which could have caused
			<lb />
			serious breach of custody of the convict. The omission
			<lb />
			&amp; commission of both the defaulters is totally
			<lb />
			intolerable being members of disciplined police force.
			<lb />
			XXX Therefore, keeping in view the overall facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of the case as well as above discussion,
			<lb />
			both the defaulters deserve exemplary punishment.
			<lb />
			Hence, I, Shibesh Singh, Deputy Commissioner of
			<lb />
			Police, 3 rd Bn. DAP, Delhi, hereby order to remove HC
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 424
			<lb />
			Ishwar Singh, No.2578/DAP and Constable Ramesh
			<lb />
			Kumar, No.7730/DAP from the force with immediate
			<lb />
			effect. Their suspension period from 27.03.2012 to
			<lb />
			22.04.2012 is also decided as period not spent on duty.‖
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			574. Mr. P.K. Dey, learned counsel has submitted that as per the
			<lb />
			call details of the two aforesaid police officials, they were in the
			<lb />
			area of Vasant Kunj during the relevant time. Mr. De, learned
			<lb />
			counsel would suggest that the father of Vikas Yadav has a
			<lb />
			farmhouse in this area and from these call details, the location of
			<lb />
			the defendant on the night of the Diwali festival is established. In
			<lb />
			support of this submission, reliance is placed on the
			<lb />
			pronouncement of Supreme Court reported at 1992 4 SCC 172
			<lb />
			Satpal v. State of Haryana.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			575. Mr. P.K. Dey, learned counsel for the complainant has
			<lb />
			contended that absences of the convict from the hospital room
			<lb />
			have, in any case, to be treated as an escape from custody and that
			<lb />
			even temporary escape is an offence and punishable under Section
			<lb />
			224 of the IPC. The further submission is that life imprisonment
			<lb />
			means rigorous imprisonment and even if a convict was sentenced
			<lb />
			to simple imprisonment, such absence tantamounts to escape from
			<lb />
			custody.

		<p>
			(d) Special facilities during AIIMS admission and charges
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			576. AIIMS has attempted to justify the admission of Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav from the 10 th of October 2011 to 4 th November, 2011 on the
			<lb />
			ground that payment from the Tihar jail for the scan was awaited.
			<lb />
			The bill record with regard to the admission of Vikas Yadav shows
			<lb />
			that for the ‗B&apos; Class private room on the 10 th of October 2011,
			<lb />
			AIIMS charged the jail authorities Rs.1,100/-per day. On the 11 th
			<lb />
			of October 2011, he was shifted to ‗A&apos; Class (Deluxe) room for
			<lb />
			which the room rent was Rs.1,700/-per day. He enjoyed a private
			<lb />
			diet @ Rs.100/-per day for seven days. The Tihar jail was billed a
			<lb />
			total of Rs.13,700/-which expense has been incurred out of public
			<lb />
			funds.

			Therefore, for the hospital admission in AIIMS in respect of
			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav from 10 th October, 2011 to 4 th November, 2011, the
			<lb />
			State has spent Rs.50750/-on room rent and diet.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			581. As per the hospital record placed before us shows that Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav was also enjoying -own diet‖ during his AIIMS admission.
			<lb />
			The Tihar jail would not have permitted him the luxury of enjoying
			<lb />
			home cooking or &quot;outings&quot; from the prison on festivals or other
			<lb />
			occasions while undergoing rigorous imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			582. It is clearly stated in the affidavit from the jail that there are
			<lb />
			no policy guidelines by the jail authorities regarding private ward
			<lb />
			room to be allotted to a jail inmate patient or its class. Such being
			<lb />
			the position, it was incumbent upon the authorities of the AIIMS to
			<lb />
			have informed the jail authorities about the substantial difference
			<lb />
			of about Rs.600/-per day in the cost of the rooms and obtaining
			<lb />
			specific approval from the competent jail authority, before
			<lb />
			changing the room.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			583. So far as the excuse for admission to a larger room that such
			<lb />
			patients have larger security personnel or secretarial staff
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 428
			<lb />
			accompanying is concerned, we find that it is no ground at all for
			<lb />
			admitting jail inmates in ‗A&apos; type room. A prisoner can have no
			<lb />
			access at all to any -secretarial staff‖. If the reason that security
			<lb />
			personnel accompany jail inmates was a reason for allotting ‗A&apos;
			<lb />
			Type private rooms, then the hundreds of jail inmates who require
			<lb />
			visits to hospitals or admissions therein would all be entitled to
			<lb />
			identical facilities. It is obvious that completely specious and
			<lb />
			untenable grounds have been set out in the affidavit in order to
			<lb />
			create the semblance of an explanation for the completely
			<lb />
			unwarranted hospitalization of Vikas Yadav in the private ward, be
			<lb />
			it Type ‗B&apos; or Type ‗A&apos; rooms of the private ward in AIIMS.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			584. The Medical Superintendent cites instances of only three
			<lb />
			prisoners as having been kept in Type ‗A&apos; private rooms in the
			<lb />
			affidavit which shows that such facilities are not available to all jail
			<lb />
			inmates but a chosen few. Is it possible that no other prisoner has
			<lb />
			ever been admitted in AIIMS for treatment? If yes, then they have
			<lb />
			obviously been kept in the general wards -with their security.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			585. It is common sense that private hospitalization is for
			<lb />
			treatment of a serious sickness or if quarantization is required.
			<lb />
			Whether the patient was kept in the general ward or a private ward,
			<lb />
			makes no difference at all to the treatment of a disease. The
			<lb />
			difference only is of the facilities enjoyed by the prisoner in the
			<lb />
			private ward. And, of course, to the expenses incurred by the
			<lb />
			public exchequer which would grossly increase if the prisoner was
			<lb />
			kept in a private ward.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			586. It needs no special information regarding the practice in
			<lb />
			private hospitals that the cost of investigations, treatment and case
			<lb />
			fees for doctor visits etc. increases in direct proportion to the class
			<lb />
			of room/facility to which the person is admitted. Therefore,
			<lb />
			treatment in an ‗A&apos; class facility/ward in a private hospital may
			<lb />
			cost two or three times than that for same investigation/treatment
			<lb />
			etc. in a ‗B&apos; class facility/ward, and up to six times what it would
			<lb />
			cost in the general ward. The difference of Rs.600/-per day
			<lb />
			maintained in the room charges in AIIMS between &apos;A&apos; and &apos;B&apos; type
			<lb />
			room manifests this position in AIIMS as well. We ask a question,
			<lb />
			why should this be permitted at the cost of the public exchequer?
			<lb />
			Especially, if treatment or medicare of the person does not require
			<lb />
			so? And if the same is warranted, why should not such facility be
			<lb />
			made available to every prisoner, irrespective of his/her
			<lb />
			economic/social/political standing or position as the right to life
			<lb />
			guaranteed under Article 21 of our Constitution guarantees equal
			<lb />
			protection of our right to life without any such distinction and it is
			<lb />
			the State&apos;s responsibility to protect the same, especially of
			<lb />
			prisoners?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			587. Despite our specific order dated 16 th March, 2012, the jail
			<lb />
			authorities offer no explanation as to why one prisoner will go to
			<lb />
			the private ward of AIIMS while another goes to general ward.
			<lb />
			Neither AIIMS nor the jail authorities disclose why and on what
			<lb />
			basis such privileges are extended. Certainly it is not the stand of
			<lb />
			these authorities that there is necessarily a correlation between the
			<lb />
			seriousness of the medical condition of the prisoner and the
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 430
			<lb />
			room/bed to which he is admitted in AIIMS. Or that only certain
			<lb />
			class of prisoners suffer ailments requiring admissions in exclusive
			<lb />
			hospital wards which the jail authorities (i.e. the public exchequer)
			<lb />
			must fund.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			588. Hospitals need to take special care in this regard where
			<lb />
			treatment of prisoners is concerned inasmuch as the expenses are
			<lb />
			borne by the public exchequer. Furthermore unless, the concerned
			<lb />
			and competent security agency or the prison authority has verified
			<lb />
			and recommended special facilities because of the nature of disease
			<lb />
			or some special security concerns of a prisoner, all prisoners would
			<lb />
			be entitled to the same treatment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii) Hospital visits and admissions of Vishal Yadav
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			589. Nilam Katara also filed Crl.M.A.No.1313/2012 dated 2 nd
			<lb />
			January, 2012 complaining that misusing financial and political
			<lb />
			position with impunity, Vishal Yadav, also a life convict is also
			<lb />
			being unnecessarily and repeatedly taken to visit the Batra Hospital
			<lb />
			and Medical Research Centre for treatment of tuberculosis. The
			<lb />
			applicant pointed out that Vishal Yadav was initially taken to the
			<lb />
			DDU Hospital which referred him to AIIMS where he was
			<lb />
			diagnosed as suffering from tuberculosis. Pursuant to an order
			<lb />
			dated 24 th March, 2004, he was permitted to visit Batra Hospital
			<lb />
			when he was an under trial person. Without any court orders or
			<lb />
			any reference by the DDU Hospital, after the conviction, Vishal
			<lb />
			Yadav has been taken to Batra Hospital almost 70 times for minor
			<lb />
			complaints. As per the complainant, out of 70 visits, 40 were for
			<lb />
			mere review, two were mysteriously recorded as -the needful‖.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			590. As per the status report dated 2 nd February, 2012, Vishal
			<lb />
			Yadav was admitted on 16 th September, 2002 in the Central Jail,
			<lb />
			Tihar and remained in custody till 10 th October, 2005 as an under
			<lb />
			trial. He was re-admitted to jail on 28 th May, 2008 upon his
			<lb />
			conviction and sentenced to life imprisonment on 30 th May, 2008.
			<lb />
			Since 28 th January, 2009, Vishal Yadav was lodged in Central Jail
			<lb />
			No.4, Tihar.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			591. So far as visits to hospitals are concerned, we are informed
			<lb />

			between 6 th December, 2003 to 12 th January, 2004 (on 6 th , 12 th , 18 th
			<lb />
			December, 2003; 1 st , 8 th and 12 th January, 2004) for gastro review
			<lb />
			in the G.B. Pant Hospital (GBPH). He again goes for a gastro
			<lb />
			review and follow-up on 10 th February, 2004; 10 th and 25 th April,
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			2004. He goes to the medicine OPD in the Deen Dayal Upadhyay
			<lb />
			Hospital (DDU Hospital) on 3 rd and 4 th June, 2004 consecutively.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Thereafter on short intervals (31 st August; 3 rd , 22 nd and 30 th
			<lb />
			September, 2004), he visits the medicine OPD in the Batra
			<lb />
			Hospital for medicine reviews. For the same purpose, he visits the
			<lb />
			medicine OPD of Batra Hospital five times (6 th , 20 th and 27 th
			<lb />
			December, 2004; 5 th , 17 th January, 2005). He thereafter undertakes
			<lb />
			three medicine reviews within 21 days (6 th , 11 th and 25 th April,
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			2005); three orthopaedic reviews in six days (24 th , 27 th and 30 th
			<lb />
			July, 2010); 15 medicine visits in 87 days to the Batra Hospital.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Vishal Yadav then made 14 visits to the medicine Department,
			<lb />
			Batra Hospital (23 rd , 30 th March, 2011, 20 th , 27 th April, 2011, 4 th ,
			<lb />
			11 th , 18 th , 26 th May, 2011, 8 th , 22, 27 th June, 2011, 13 th , 27 th July,
			<lb />
			2011 and 10 th August, 2011).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			593. From 27th December, 2004, Dr. Manohar Lal Sindhwani
			<lb />
			from the Department of Internal Medicine was the doctor who was
			<lb />
			attending to Vishal Yadav&apos;s every complaint.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			594. A question arose in our mind as to how did this cycle of
			<lb />
			visits and admissions of Vishal Yadav to the Batra Hospital
			<lb />
			commence? In this regard, the Jail Superintendent has also placed
			<lb />
			before us the following order dated 23 rd August, 2004 passed by
			<lb />
			the learned Single Judge in Bail App.No.1215/2004, which was
			<lb />
			filed by Vishal Yadav:
			<lb />
			-The petitioner seeks interim bail being diagnosed as
			<lb />
			suffering from disseminated tuberculosis with
			<lb />
			pleuropericardial effusion with pulmonary and
			<lb />
			mediastinal lymphoadenopathy. He has been
			<lb />
			undergoing treatment for the said ailments as advised
			<lb />
			by AIIMS. Lastly, his case was reviewed at AIIMS on
			<lb />
			6th August, 2004 and he was advised to continue anti-
			<lb />
			tubercular treatment besides review in cardiology
			<lb />
			department. Plea for release on interim bail is being
			<lb />
			opposed on behalf of the respondent State on the ground
			<lb />
			that one of the material witnesses Ms. Bharti Yadav
			<lb />
			remains yet to be examined. He refers to an order dated
			<lb />
			14th October, 2003 of this Court whereby request for
			<lb />
			release on interim bail was declined earlier and the
			<lb />
			petitioner could renew the plea in that regard only after
			<lb />
			the statement of Ms. Bharti Yadav is recorded by the
			<lb />
			Trial Court. Confronted with the aforesaid order, the
			<lb />
			petitioner seeks a direction to Jail Superintendent
			<lb />
			concerned to take him to Batra Hospital instead of
			<lb />
			AIIMS for further investigation and treatment of the
			<lb />
			ailments he is suffering from. Learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			State of U.P. has no objection to such a request being
			<lb />
			granted. Accordingly while declining the release of the
			<lb />
			petitioner on interim bail on medical ground a direction
			<lb />
			is issued to the Jail Superintendent concerned to
			<lb />
			arrange for or taking the petitioner in custody to Batra
			<lb />
			Hospital as and when so required for his further
			<lb />
			treatment at his own cost of the ailment he is suffering
			<lb />
			from. In case of any difficulty being experienced, the
			<lb />
			petitioner would be at liberty to approach this Court
			<lb />
			from time to time. Petition is disposed of.
			<lb />
			Dasti.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
			This order was passed when Vishal Yadav was an under
			<lb />
			trial.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			595. Our attention is drawn to a communication dated 12 th
			<lb />
			December, 2011 from the office of the Director General (Prisons)
			<lb />
			addressed to the Registrar General of this court mentioning that
			<lb />
			&quot;under the shield of this order, the prisoner had visited the Batra
			<lb />
			Hospital&quot; for more than 80 occasions during the past years after the
			<lb />
			order and &quot;he is not regular in taking the prescribed medicines as
			<lb />
			per the observations of the treating doctor&quot;. A clarification was
			<lb />
			sought based on the change of the status of the prisoner from under
			<lb />
			trial to convict as well as the policy formulated by the prison
			<lb />
			department.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			596. The Registrar General placed this communication before the
			<lb />
			learned Single Judge on 18 th January, 2012, when it was clarified
			<lb />
			that the relief granted in the order dated 23rd August, 2004 could
			<lb />
			not be extended to Vishal Yadav after his conviction and that in
			<lb />
			case Vishal Yadav would require any medical treatment, he would
			<lb />
			be at liberty &quot;to make such request before the concerned court&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			597. It is important to note that the order dated 23rd August, 2008
			<lb />
			refers to Vishal Yadav suffering from disseminated tuberculosis
			<lb />
			with pleuropericardial effusion with pulmonary and mediastinal
			<lb />
			lymphoadenopathy. It was clearly directed that as and when he
			<lb />
			was required to be taken to Batra Hospital for &quot;further treatment&quot;,
			<lb />
			it was to be &quot;at his own cost of the ailment he is suffering from&quot;.
			<lb />
			The directions of the court were explicit that he could be taken for
			<lb />
			treatment of this disease alone and none other. The cost, which
			<lb />
			was required to be paid by the prisoner, would be all costs involved
			<lb />
			for taking treatment from Batra Hospital.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 440
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			598. As per the record, interestingly, in his visits and admissions
			<lb />
			to the Batra Hospital, Vishal Yadav was under the treatment of
			<lb />
			one, Dr. Manohar Lal Sindhwani. This doctor had recorded that so
			<lb />
			far as the Tuberculosis was concerned, -Tuberculosis was
			<lb />
			completed/cured‖. On the 15 th of September, 2009, the jail
			<lb />
			authorities had requested the Batra Hospital to -kindly advice is it
			<lb />
			necessary to send the patient to very hospital for review, as we are
			<lb />
			having medicine and chest specialist in jail hospital‖. Dr.
			<lb />
			Sindhwani gave no response to this query and continued to call
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav to Batra Hospital for review on flimsy and non-
			<lb />
			specific grounds, which cannot be verified.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			599. It is well nigh impossible to deal with each every hospital
			<lb />
			visit of the convict or his hospital admission in this judgment. The
			<lb />
			tabulation of the hospital visits of Vishal Yadav would show that
			<lb />
			visits to the same departments of the hospital were separated by
			<lb />
			gaps of were 2, 3, 4 days. All visits, be it for an Orthopaedic,
			<lb />
			neurology, neurosurgery, radiology or any other problem, have
			<lb />
			been advised by Dr. Manohar Lal Sindhwani.
			<lb />
			Interestingly,
			<lb />
			almost on every visit to Batra Hospital, Dr. Sindhwani has planned
			<lb />
			(&quot;advised&quot;) the next visit, on most occasions after a gap of barely
			<lb />
			one week only!
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			600. In four visits to the Neurology Department of the Batra
			<lb />
			Hospital between 17 th August, 2011 and 14 th September, 2011,
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav is seen by Dr. M.L. Sindhwani as -one Dr. Dua was
			<lb />
			busy in the O.T.‖. Vishal Yadav appears to have complaining
			<lb />
			about a lower backache, which ought to have been seen by an
			<lb />
			orthopaedician or neurologist whereas Dr. Sindhwani, a specialist
			<lb />
			of internal medicine, examined the convict.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			601. We also questioned as to how, after his conviction, Vishal
			<lb />
			Yadav came to be repeatedly referred and sent by the jail
			<lb />
			authorities to the Batra Hospital and required the State to disclose
			<lb />
			the same. The State has placed a copy of the memorandum dated
			<lb />
			18 th February, 2012 addressed by the Medical Officer Incharge of
			<lb />
			the Central Jail No.4 to Superintendent, Central Jail No.4, Tihar
			<lb />
			Jail, New Delhi informing that Vishal Yadav -was initially
			<lb />
			referred to Batra Hospital as per the court order. Subsequently he
			<lb />
			was referred as per the advice of treating doctors of Batra
			<lb />
			Hospital‖. Therefore, without any intervention or recommendation
			<lb />
			of the concerned medical experts in the jail or at the jail referral
			<lb />
			hospitals i.e. DDU Hospital and LNJP Hospital, Vishal Yadav was
			<lb />
			permitted to be taken out of the jail repeatedly to visit Batra
			<lb />
			Hospital merely on the &apos;advice&apos; of Dr. M.L. Sindhwani. No effort
			<lb />
			was made by the jail authorities even to ascertain whether such
			<lb />
			visit was warranted or not.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			602. In his reply dated 22 nd March, 2012 filed before us, Vishal
			<lb />
			Yadav admits that he was required to be produced for the purpose
			<lb />
			of treatment -whenever necessary as per the opinion of the jail
			<lb />
			doctor‖. There is no such record of opinion of the relevant medical
			<lb />
			experts of the jail. It is evident that Vishal Yadav has taken such a
			<lb />
			plea to disown the responsibility for his actions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			603. Let us also examine some more information which points
			<lb />
			towards the health of the convict. Vide his letter dated 15 th
			<lb />
			Methycobal&apos;, &apos;Megancuron Plus&apos;); digestive enzyme (&apos;Aristozyme&apos;,
			<lb />
			&apos;syrup Viva Blook&apos;); multi vitamin (&apos;A to Z&apos;, &apos;Becousule-Z&apos;);
			<lb />
			vitamin D (&apos;Inj. Arachitol&apos;); asthma (&apos;Montair Plus&apos;); antibiotic
			<lb />
			(&apos;Tab. Forcox&apos;); nasal spray (&apos;Flomist&apos;); cough/cold/fever (&apos;Hatrik-
			<lb />
			3&apos;). Is there any ailment covered by these medicines, which could
			<lb />
			not be treated in the jail hospital or even the DDU Hospital? The
			<lb />
			answer is a clear negative.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			604. So far as treatment and medication for tuberculosis as well
			<lb />
			as reference to his investigations are concerned, the Medical
			<lb />
			Officer Incharge, has informed thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-As per the medical record the patient was treated for
			<lb />
			Disseminated Tuberculosis (pleuropericardial effusion
			<lb />
			with pulmonary and Mediastinal Lymphnode) in 2004.
			<lb />
			The inmate refused to take any medicines from CJ-4
			<lb />
			Dispensary as he is taking the medicines on his own as
			<lb />
			stated by the inmate. He was initially referred to Batra
			<lb />
			Hospital as per court order and on subsequent visits he
			<lb />
			was referred as per the advice of treating Doctor. The
			<lb />
			details of visits to outside hospitals as per medical
			<lb />
			record is enclosed (page No. 1 to7).
			<lb />
			CECT Abdomen and pelvis (Dated 16.03.2011) at Batra
			<lb />
			Hospital reveals no significant abnormality in abdomen
			<lb />
			pelvis.
			<lb />
			MRI of Lumbo -Sacral spine (Dated 05.10.2010) at
			<lb />
			Batra Hospital reveals difuse Disc bulge at L5-S1.
			<lb />
			As per medical record on most of the visits to batra
			<lb />
			hospital he was being reviewed/follow up for low
			<lb />
			backache and pain abdomen.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			605. It is noteworthy that the convict Vishal Yadav has produced
			<lb />
			no documentary proof at all that he procured or took any
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 444
			<lb />
			medication for tuberculosis. Thus with regard to Vishal Yadav as
			<lb />
			well there is also no material with regard to treatment of
			<lb />
			tuberculosis at all placed on record by either the jail authorities,
			<lb />
			any hospital or the prisoner himself. No investigation reports
			<lb />
			which would support the diagnosis exist. It is unbelievable that
			<lb />
			such an educated person would not preserve his own medical
			<lb />
			record, if it actually existed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			606. Shri Vijender Singh, Superintendent (Jails), Tihar Jail has
			<lb />
			sworn and filed an affidavit on the 4 th of October, 2012 before us
			<lb />
			stating that amongst the facilities available at the 150 bedded
			<lb />
			Central Jail Hospital, there is a tuberculosis ward. The affidavit
			<lb />
			discloses that -patients who do not get cured on O.P.D. basis are
			<lb />
			referred by the doctors of the respective jails to Central Jail
			<lb />
			Hospital for investigations and treatment Central Jail Hospital
			<lb />
			provides round the clock emergency services and in patient
			<lb />
			treatment facilities. Junior residents, Senior Residents, Medical
			<lb />
			Officer and Consultants are working under Senior Medical Officer
			<lb />
			Hospital along with other medical and Paramedical staff‖.
			<lb />
			It is further stated that in the Central Jail Hospital, specialists
			<lb />
			in medicine ophthalmology, orthopaedics, chest and tuberculosis,
			<lb />
			skin, psychiatry, pathology are available.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			607. The Central Jail hospital thus has consultants who are
			<lb />
			specialists in medicine ophthalmology, orthopaedics, chest and
			<lb />
			tuberculosis, skin, psychiatry and pathology. The hospital has an
			<lb />
			entire ward for patients of tuberculosis. Apart from the facilities
			<lb />
			available within the jail itself, the referral DDU Hospital located
			<lb />
			close by is also able to provide treatment for tuberculosis. This
			<lb />
			apart, in Delhi there are specialised departments, clinics as well as
			<lb />
			hospitals devoted to the treatment of tuberculosis and chest disease,
			<lb />
			including the National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory
			<lb />
			Diseases, Sri Aurobindo Marg, Near Qutab Minar, New Delhi-
			<lb />
			110030; Babu Jagjiwan Ram Chest Clinic, Jehangir Puri, Delhi-
			<lb />
			110033; Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital and T.B. Chest Clinic,
			<lb />
			Sector-6, Rohini, Delhi-110085; DDU Hospital Chest Clinic, Hari
			<lb />
			Nagar, Delhi-110014; Kingsway Camp Chest Clinic, GTB Nagar
			<lb />
			Kingsway Camp, Delhi-110009; Lok Nayak Hospital, J.N. Marg,
			<lb />
			Delhi-110002 and Vallabhai Patel Chest Institute, North Campus,
			<lb />
			Vijay Nagar Marg, Delhi University, Delhi-110007.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			608. For radiological investigations as well as orthopaedic
			<lb />
			complaints, Vikas Yadav was visiting the DDU Hospital as well as
			<lb />
			LNJP Hospital. The Safdarjung Hospital has an elaborate and
			<lb />
			renowned orthopaedic department. In the jail itself as well as, in
			<lb />
			close proximity, all facilities are available. There would be no
			<lb />
			question of referring any person to a tertiary care referral hospital,
			<lb />
			especially for primary investigations or treatment of routine
			<lb />
			ailments as abdomen pain, backache, nasal blockage, etc. which are
			<lb />
			required to be addressed by primary facilities. It is only after a
			<lb />
			detailed clinical examination by a medical expert, investigations, if
			<lb />
			any, that a reference could be made to a tertiary care referral
			<lb />
			hospital of the nature of AIIMS or the Batra Hospital. This has
			<lb />
			been avoided in the present case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			609. The aforesaid status report also informs that between 5 th
			<lb />
			July, 2010 till 2 nd February, 2012, Vishal Yadav had 15 court
			<lb />
			appearances outside jail. On each occasion, he was handed over to
			<lb />
			DAP escort a day prior to the court date and was admitted back
			<lb />
			after attending the date.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			610. Our observations on the frequent hospital visits of Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav squarely apply to these visits of Vishal Yadav as well, only
			<lb />
			difference being of the dates and hospital. There is no material at
			<lb />
			all to justify these visits of the convict to the outside hospitals.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) Admissions of Vishal Yadav in Batra Hospital
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			611. The details of hospital/admissions of Vishal Yadav from 3 rd
			<lb />
			June, 2004 (Annexure ‗B&apos;) have also been placed by the State
			<lb />
			before us. While the first admission was to the DDU Hospital on
			<lb />
			3 rd June, 2004 for 2 days 6 hours 50 minutes; the second admission
			<lb />
			of Vishal Yadav was to the AIIMS hospital on the 28 th June, 2004
			<lb />
			to 7th July, 2004 (8 days). He was thereafter admitted in the Batra
			<lb />
			Hospital from 3rd September, 2004 to 15th September, 2004(12
			<lb />
			days).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			612. So far as admissions of Vishal Yadav in the Batra Hospital
			<lb />
			are concerned, till his conviction on 28 th May, 2008, Vishal Yadav
			<lb />
			was admitted in the Batra Hospital only once from 31 st August,
			<lb />
			2004 to 15 th September, 2004 (15 days, 13 hours and 30 minutes).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			613. Apart from the OPD visits to Batra Hospital regarding the
			<lb />
			admissions of Vishal Yadav, some shocking facts are revealed.
			<lb />
			We propose to briefly advert to these admissions to illustrate the
			<lb />
			conduct of the prisoner despite conviction for such major offences.
			<lb />
			After his conviction, Vishal Yadav was inter alia admitted in the
			<lb />
			Batra Hospital on the following occasions as well :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			S.No. Duration
			<lb />
			(i)
			<lb />
			Admitted in Batra Hospital from 07.07.2008 to
			<lb />
			07.08.2008 (32 days)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(ii) ---do---from 14.08.2008 to 06.09.2008 (24 days)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii) ---do---from 24.10.2008 to 15.12.2008 (53 days)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iv) ---do---from 25.02.2009 to 04.06.2009 ( 100 days)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(v) ---do---from 07.10.2009 to 16.12.2009 ( 71 days)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(vi) ---do---from 29.09.2010 to 03.11.2010 (36 days)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(vii) ---do---from 14.10.2011 to 17.10.2011 (4 days)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			614. The close proximity of the above Batra Hospital admissions
			<lb />
			(separated by few weeks to a couple of months only) and the life of
			<lb />
			a person in luxurious private ward facilities in the Batra Hospital
			<lb />
			points to the design of the prisoner to keep himself out of jail.
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav was admitted thrice -from 7 th July, 2008 to 7 th
			<lb />
			August, 2008 (for 32 days); from 14 th August, 2008 to 6 th
			<lb />
			September, 2008 (for 24 days) and 24 th October, 2008 to 15 th
			<lb />
			December, 2008 (for 53 days) as a case of the old tuberculosis.
			<lb />
			The re-admission on 14 th August, 2008 was within seven days of
			<lb />
			discharge from the Batra Hospital on 7 th August, 2008, after a stay
			<lb />
			of 32 days.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			615. During his admission of about 3½ months from 25 th
			<lb />
			February, 2009 to 4 th June, 2009, as per the discharge summary
			<lb />
			produced by the Batra Hospital, Vishal Yadav was administered
			<lb />
			innocuous medications of the nature of Metrogyl, Spasmindon,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 448
			<lb />
			Aristogyme for infections, cramps (spasms), enzyme respectively,
			<lb />
			which are given for minor ailments. All these medicines clearly
			<lb />
			suggest that the convict was not suffering from any major ailment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			616. In the prolonged admission from 7 th December, 2009 to 16 th
			<lb />
			December, 2009 (of 2 months and 10 days), the said Dr. Manohar
			<lb />
			Lal Sindhwani, Consultant in Internal Medicine Department had
			<lb />
			advised admission for surgery. After Vishal Yadav&apos;s prolonged
			<lb />
			stay of 2 months and 10 days, the convict was discharged without
			<lb />
			any surgery. Dr. Sindhwani certainly was not competent to either
			<lb />
			make a surgical diagnosis nor had the expertise to treat a patient
			<lb />
			who needed surgery. A shocking state of affairs is revealed from
			<lb />
			the above details of Vishal Yadav&apos;s hospital visits to the Batra
			<lb />
			Hospital that a specialist in internal medicine was providing
			<lb />
			orthopaedic, neurology, cardiology as well as surgical opinions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			617. So far as the last admission is concerned, Vishal Yadav had
			<lb />
			been referred to Batra Hospital for a review only. Where was the
			<lb />
			occasion for his admission?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			618. So far as the medical opinion on the records of the treatment
			<lb />
			and hospitalization of Vishal Yadav is concerned, the medical
			<lb />
			board of officers at the Army Hospital (R&amp;R), Delhi Cantt. has
			<lb />
			submitted a report under the cover of the letter dated 19 th June,
			<lb />
			2012 giving the following conclusions :
			<lb />
			-3. The Board, having perused all the medical
			<lb />
			records produced before it, has come to the following
			<lb />
			conclusions:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(a) Mr. Vishal Yadav was diagnosed to have
			<lb />
			Tubercular
			<lb />
			pleuropericarditis
			<lb />
			with
			<lb />
			Cervical
			<lb />
			Lymphadenopathy prior to 31 Aug 2004 and started
			<lb />
			on anti tubercular treatment with effect from Jun 2004.

			620. The report of the experts from the Army R&amp;R Hospital

			clearly establishes that tubercular lymphadenopathy is treated

			world over on OPD basis. It does not warrant hospitalization

			suggest that Vishal Yadav was actually suffering from no

			record of Vishal Yadav as submitted by the Batra Hospital with

			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			622. In the reply dated 22 nd March, 2012 filed on behalf of Vishal
			<lb />
			Yadav supported by an affidavit of his brother, Shri Vivek Yadav,
			<lb />
			it is submitted on behalf of Vishal Yadav that his Tuberculosis
			<lb />
			appears to be a direct result of the ills affecting the prison system.
			<lb />
			It has been orally suggested that tuberculosis is widely rampant in
			<lb />
			the jail. If the treatment given to Vishal Yadav was the correct
			<lb />
			treatment, then the several prisoners suffering from tuberculosis
			<lb />
			should all have been visiting or admitted in private rooms Batra
			<lb />
			Hospital to ensure parity of treatment to prisoners.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			623. We have noted the negative medical opinion with regard to
			<lb />
			requirement of hospitalisation for Kochs disease (tuberculosis)
			<lb />
			while considering the case of Vikas Yadav above. The medical
			<lb />
			record of Vishal Yadav also does not support any need for hospital
			<lb />
			admission on these occasions. There is neither clinical evidence
			<lb />
			nor investigation results which support any requirement for
			<lb />
			hospitalisations. On the contrary, despite being advised discharge,
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav continued his hospital stay for weeks at an end
			<lb />
			without any reason.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			624. We are of the view that Vishal Yadav has also acted in
			<lb />
			violation of the order dated 23 rd August, 2004 which did not permit
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 456
			<lb />
			any visits to the Batra Hospital for the minor ailments as nausea,
			<lb />
			vomiting, stomach disorder, nasal blockage and the like. Vishal
			<lb />
			Yadav was not only taken to the Batra Hospital as an outpatient for
			<lb />
			trivial complaints but was also repeatedly hospitalized for the
			<lb />
			same.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			625. Pursuant to our order dated 2 nd February, 2012, Vishal
			<lb />
			Yadav was also medically examined by the aforesaid Board at
			<lb />
			AIIMS in February, 2012 when the following report was given :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-Final conclusion and Recommendations of the
			<lb />
			Medical Board:
			<lb />
			Based on the information obtained by review of medical
			<lb />
			reports shown by the jail authorities, detailed history
			<lb />
			and findings of the clinical examination plus relevant
			<lb />
			investigations, it is reported that Sh. Vishal Yadav is
			<lb />
			able to perform all the activities of daily living without
			<lb />
			assistance and is currently not suffering from any
			<lb />
			acute or severe medical condition which requires
			<lb />
			hospitalization or active intervention -medical
			<lb />
			surgical or investigational. He is stable and actively
			<lb />
			mobile. The complaints mentioned by him are mild
			<lb />
			and of chronic nature and can be managed by taking
			<lb />
			appropriate care and medications.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			626. It is further pointed out that Vishal Yadav was admitted in
			<lb />
			the Batra Hospital w.e.f. 7 th October, 2009 to 15 th December, 2009
			<lb />
			i.e. for a period of 70 days and wanted out of prison for which one
			<lb />
			excuse after another was being created. Vishal Yadav had got filed
			<lb />
			Crl.M.(Bail)No.157/2009 dated 15 th December, 2009 seeking
			<lb />
			interim bail on the ground of his sister&apos;s marriage from 14 th
			<lb />
			January, 2010 to 31 st January, 2010. He deliberately concealed the
			<lb />
			fact that he was not in jail when he filed this application.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			627. We find that the hospital visits and admissions of Vishal
			<lb />
			Yadav post conviction were without permission from the
			<lb />
			concerned court or from any authority. No referral from any jail
			<lb />
			doctor for the visits or admissions is also forthcoming. Specialists
			<lb />
			to look after the complaints of the prisoner were available in the
			<lb />
			jail hospital. There is therefore, substance in the submission that
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav has actively manipulated authority, connived with
			<lb />
			jail authorities and the doctors at the Batra Hospital to keep himself
			<lb />
			out of jail and away from undergoing the sentence of life
			<lb />
			imprisonment imposed on him on false pretexts of medical
			<lb />
			treatment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii) Analysis of hospital visit/admission discussion
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			628. It is noteworthy that we had given opportunity to the
			<lb />
			convicts to place all records of their medical condition and
			<lb />
			treatment before the Board of Officers constituted by the Army
			<lb />
			Hospital (R&amp;R), Delhi Cantt. as well as before us.
			<lb />
			No record at all has been produced of prescriptions, medical
			<lb />
			investigation, treatment, bills, payment records, etc. by either of the
			<lb />
			defendants with regard to the visits to any hospital as an out or as
			<lb />
			in patient, before or after their convictions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			629. Vikas Yadav has also not required any outside hospital visits
			<lb />
			after 23 rd January, 2012 when Crl.M.A.No.1168/2012 was filed.
			<lb />
			There is no averment or evidence of any sickness before his arrest.
			<lb />
			No record of treatment in any hospital is On the
			<lb />
			contrary, as per available record, Vikas Yadav stopped T.B.
			<lb />
			treatment without any medical advice. The jail has no record of his
			<lb />
			having taken ever taken medication for the same. After the initial
			<lb />
			mention that Vikas Yadav suffering from T.B., there is no mention
			<lb />
			of any such disease.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			630. If Vishal Yadav was so sick that he required such extensive
			<lb />
			hospitalization after his conviction, it can be reasonably expected
			<lb />
			that there would have been some kind of sickness in the prior
			<lb />
			period of 2½ years when he was on bail during trial. There is no
			<lb />
			assertion even of illness, let alone any evidence to support the
			<lb />
			same. Vishal Yadav has also not made any outside hospital visits
			<lb />
			after 27 th January, 2012 when Crl.M.A.No.1313/2012 was filed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			631. The above factors also lend support to the objection that the
			<lb />
			complaints of sickness, visits to and hospitalizations were
			<lb />
			contrived, manipulated and were not for any genuine medical
			<lb />
			problem.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			632. We have set out above the extensive number of visits of the
			<lb />
			two convicts in the present case to the hospitals as well as the
			<lb />
			details of their hospitalization. We have noted that from the
			<lb />
			record, the convicts have been enjoying their own diet.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			633. It is complained by Mr. P.K. Dey, learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			complainant that while the convict Vishal Yadav was luxuriating in
			<lb />
			the Batra Hospital, he also ran up a total bill of Rs.55,000/-for
			<lb />
			making telephonic calls alone. Mr. Sanjay Jain, learned counsel for
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav has submitted that these calls were not only by
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 459
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav but by his and mother as well who were with
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav as his attendants during his admission in the Batra
			<lb />
			Hospital.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			634. We may point out that neither Vishal Yadav nor Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav, was so ill as to need an attendant with them during his
			<lb />
			hospital stay. There is no record of any treatment being
			<lb />
			administered which had to be monitored at these times. Clearly,
			<lb />
			the admissions were to keep the convicts out of jail in the company
			<lb />
			of wife/relatives, with access to visitors, telephone facilities, home
			<lb />
			cooking with facilities as in the nature of private room, private
			<lb />
			bathroom, air conditioning, etc. similar to those they would have
			<lb />
			enjoyed at home. It was certainly not the regimented lifestyle
			<lb />
			which the jail stay entails.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			635. In a reply which is dated 1 st October, 2012, it has been stated
			<lb />
			by Vishal Yadav that -each and every expense of the treatment and
			<lb />
			the calls has been borne by the answering respondent and the
			<lb />
			answering respondent has in fact spent about Rs.25 lakhs apart
			<lb />
			from certain medicines in the treatment, which in fact lessen the
			<lb />
			cost on the government exchequer‖. The defendant is unable to
			<lb />
			support these submissions with any record of treatment for a
			<lb />
			serious disease which required his hospitalizations.
			<lb />
			In
			<lb />
			Crl.M.A.No.4073/2012, Vishal Yadav claims to
			<lb />
			have spent
			<lb />
			Rs.23,60,000/-on treatment. This figure, coupled with the amount
			<lb />
			of Rs.55,000/-spent on phones reeks of the luxury which the
			<lb />
			defendant enjoyed. That he could procure it while undergoing a life
			<lb />
			sentence indubitably points to an inability to conform to legal
			<lb />
			systems.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			636. It needs no elaboration that merely because you can afford
			<lb />
			it, would justify hospital admission, especially when as a life
			<lb />
			convict, prisoners are required to undergo the sentence of rigorous
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			637. The facilities enjoyed in the private rooms in AIIMS or in
			<lb />
			Batra Hospital have not the remotest of the semblance or
			<lb />
			comparison to the discipline during jail incarceration. The
			<lb />
			facilities enjoyed in private rooms are certainly way beyond those
			<lb />
			available even in the general wards of the Batra Hospital or
			<lb />
			AIIMS. The facilities which were made available to these two
			<lb />
			defendants in these hospitals can bear no comparison to those
			<lb />
			which are provided in the general ward in government hospitals
			<lb />
			which other prisoners would have got.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			638. In the jail, the prisoners do not have access to telephone
			<lb />
			facilities or the benefit of air conditioning or personalized
			<lb />
			bathroom and private toilet facilities. Both these convicts have had
			<lb />
			prolonged stays outside the regimentation and discipline of the jail.
			<lb />
			Such stays were as per their whim and desire.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			639. The defendants need to be reminded that while it is the duty
			<lb />
			and responsibility of the State to ensure the health and well being
			<lb />
			of the convicts but it is no part of State&apos;s responsibility to facilitate
			<lb />
			or incur expenditure of even a single paisa for enabling prisoners to
			<lb />
			make unwarranted visits outside the jail or to facilitate a convict&apos;s
			<lb />
			unwarranted visits to or stays in hospital.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 461
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			640. It is therefore, obvious that Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav
			<lb />
			have utilized the shield of the hospital visits and stays in
			<lb />
			connivance with jail authorities as well as doctors at the hospital
			<lb />
			which they visited or were to. They manipulated the
			<lb />
			systems deliberately and knowingly with impunity without any
			<lb />
			respect for law or authority, sure and confident that their unholy
			<lb />
			and illegal acts would go undetected and they could avoid
			<lb />
			undergoing the imprisonment awarded to them, in any sense.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			641. For the period between 30 th of May, 2008 till 17 th October,
			<lb />
			2011 of 36 months and 140 days, Vishal Yadav has spent 32 days
			<lb />
			(from 7 th July, 2008 to 7 th August, 2008); 24 days (from 14 th
			<lb />
			August, 2008 to 6 th September, 2008), 53 days (24 th October, 2008
			<lb />
			to 15 th December, 2008); 100 days (from 25 th February, 2009 to 6 th
			<lb />
			June, 2009); 71 days (from 7 th October, 2009 to 16 th December,
			<lb />
			2009); 36 days (from 29 th September, 2010 to 3 rd November,
			<lb />
			2010); 4 days (from 14 th October, 2011 to 17 th October, 2011)
			<lb />
			(totalling 320 days, equivalent to over 10 months) in private rooms
			<lb />
			in the Batra Hospital in the company of his family with wife and/or
			<lb />
			mother staying with him without any medical justification for the
			<lb />
			same. The defendant has also partaken home or outside cooking
			<lb />
			during this period. With such relatives, friends and acquaintances
			<lb />
			who were not in hospital, he has freely engaged on the telephone
			<lb />
			access.
			<lb />
			This period certainly cannot be treated as part of
			<lb />
			imprisonment already undergone by the defendant.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 462
			<lb />
			642. Similarly, the comfortable stay of Vikas Yadav from the 10 th
			<lb />
			of October, 2011 to 4 th November, 2011 (23 days) in the private
			<lb />
			ward [&apos;B&apos; category room (for one day) and then the ‗A&apos; category
			<lb />
			room] in AIIMS in the company of &quot;attendants&quot; (noted in his case
			<lb />
			sheets) with full freedom in terms of diet, access to friends and
			<lb />
			family; freedom to take outings, cannot be treated as period during
			<lb />
			which the convict was undergoing even simple imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv) Cost of hospital visit/admission
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			643. We now come to a critical question which arises in the
			<lb />
			present case. Given the above discussion, is it fair to burden the
			<lb />
			public exchequer with the costs of such &apos;outings&apos; for prisoners?
			<lb />
			Before we answer, let us examine the stand of the two convicts.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			644. So far as Vikas Yadav is concerned, despite opportunity, no
			<lb />
			medical record produced. Only a brief synopsis dated 11th March,
			<lb />
			2013 has been filed. Mr. Verma has vehemently contended that
			<lb />
			T.B. is widely rampant in the jail and the convict contracted the
			<lb />
			infection from jail. It is also submitted that he has been rightly
			<lb />
			taken to the hospitals for the several visits. Learned counsel would
			<lb />
			justify Vikas Yadav&apos;s admission in AIIMS and his absences from
			<lb />
			the hospital room as well. It is submitted that the medical
			<lb />
			treatment of Vikas Yadav while in custody was the absolute
			<lb />
			responsibility of the State and he cannot be called upon to bear
			<lb />
			costs thereof. Mr. Verma would deny liability for the cost thereof
			<lb />
			contending that the practice of taking prisoners on outside hospital
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 463
			<lb />
			visits is common and that there is nothing unique about either the
			<lb />
			defendant&apos;s visits or his client&apos;s hospital admission.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			645. Vishal Yadav has opposed the consideration of the aspect of
			<lb />
			liability for the costs on the hospital visits and admissions from the
			<lb />
			perspective that it is the bounden duty of the State/its agencies to
			<lb />
			bear the costs for the security of the convicts and that Vishal Yadav
			<lb />
			was never a free man; as his visits were controlled by the prison
			<lb />
			authorities. It is submitted that in the order dated 23 rd August,
			<lb />
			2004, Vishal Yadav had undertaken to bear only the cost of
			<lb />
			treatment which would be incurred at the Batra Hospital and not
			<lb />
			the cost incurred on the security arrangements to take him to and
			<lb />
			fro from the jail premises.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			646. The order dated 23 rd August, 2004 nowhere restricts &apos;cost&apos; to
			<lb />
			only treatment cost. The use of the expression ‗cost&apos; would show
			<lb />
			that the court intended Vishal Yadav to bear all costs which would
			<lb />
			be incurred on his visits to Batra Hospital for undergoing treatment
			<lb />
			for tuberculosis. Vishal Yadav, a literate and well placed
			<lb />
			individual, was fully conscious that he was in custody and the
			<lb />
			‗costs&apos; entailed in being treated in the Batra Hospital would include
			<lb />
			not only the cost of treatment but also expenditure transportation as
			<lb />
			well as providing the security and other ancillary costs. In fact
			<lb />
			expenditure on all counts for the purpose of taking him to Batra
			<lb />
			Hospital was inherent in the direction that the prisoner would bear
			<lb />
			the costs of the treatment at Batra Hospital.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			647. It is also pertinent that the order nowhere directed the State
			<lb />
			to incur costs for visits to the hospital which were not warranted,
			<lb />
			especially costs of prolonged hospital stays for months together
			<lb />
			without any reason or justification.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) Cost incurred on escort/security deployment during outside
			<lb />
			hospital visits
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			648. Every expense incurred on a prisoner, whether under trial or
			<lb />
			a convict is additional burden on the public exchequer. Examining
			<lb />
			the hospital visits of the convict from the perspective of the
			<lb />
			unwarranted expense and drain of public resources, we had called
			<lb />
			upon the State to inform us as to the costs which were entailed in
			<lb />
			providing escort and guard duties to the two prisoners as well as
			<lb />
			other expenses incurred thereon. The State has been able to
			<lb />
			provide some details of expenses incurred on providing escorts to
			<lb />
			the prisoners and taxi fare on some occasions. We consider the
			<lb />
			few details provided hereafter.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			649. The State has filed an affidavit of Shri Shamsher Singh
			<lb />
			posted as Superintendent, Central Jail No.4, Tihar with regard to
			<lb />
			the costs incurred for provision of security arrangements in respect
			<lb />
			of Vikas Yadav for his referral visits to AIIMS and the DDU
			<lb />
			Hospital and the costs incurred by the 3 rd Battalion for making
			<lb />
			security arrangements when he was admitted to the hospital.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			650. As per the memo dated 22 nd February, 2012 from the office
			<lb />
			of the Deputy Commissioner of Police, 3 rd Battalion, DAP, Delhi,
			<lb />
			no money is charged from prisoners for escort and guard duties of
			<lb />
			under trial prisoners. In custody parole cases, payment is charged
			<lb />
			when specific orders are given by the court and guard charges are
			<lb />
			calculated on the basis of the Government of Delhi notifications
			<lb />
			dated 5 th August, 1999 and 16 th July, 2007.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			651. Implicit in the above directions is the fact that security/escort
			<lb />
			has to be deployed only for such hospital visits as have been
			<lb />
			authorised in accordance with law. Certainly for such authorised
			<lb />
			hospital visits, it would be the duty of the State to ensure escort and
			<lb />
			guard duties. Can the same be said of such visits and admissions
			<lb />
			as are not required for medical reasons?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			652. The office of the Deputy Commissioner of Police, 3 rd
			<lb />
			Battalion DAP, Delhi has placed a copy of Standing Order
			<lb />
			No.52/2008 in this regard. It is been pointed out that as per this
			<lb />
			Standing Order, it was the duty of the 3 rd Battalion DAP to escort
			<lb />
			under trial witnesses during their court production as well as to
			<lb />
			hospitals for treatment and to guard them during such visits.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			653. Additionally, a copy of the Notification No.6/71/98/HP-Estt.
			<lb />
			dated July, 2007 issued in exercise of powers conferred under
			<lb />
			Section 40(2) of the Delhi Police Act, 1978 by the Lieutenant
			<lb />
			Governor of the NCT of Delhi prescribing the scale of charges in
			<lb />
			respect of deployment of additional police on payment to private
			<lb />
			persons, commercial establishment and for other duties of the
			<lb />
			nature as provided in Sections 39 and 40 of the said Act, has been
			<lb />
			placed before us. As per this notification, the following are the
			<lb />
			rates of charges for the above duties:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			1. Assistant Commissioner
			<lb />
			of Police
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Rs.831 Per day of
			<lb />
			five hours of
			<lb />
			per night of
			<lb />
			four hours
			<lb />
			2. Inspector of Police
			<lb />
			Rs.903 --do--
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			3. Sub-Inspector of Police Rs.773 --do--
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			4. Assistant Sub-Inspector
			<lb />
			of Police
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Rs.548 --do--
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			5. Head Constable
			<lb />
			Rs.451 --do--
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			6. Constable
			<lb />
			Rs.425 --do--
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			654. Distressed by the impunity and complete lack of respect for
			<lb />
			systems, law, human resources and scarce medical facilities
			<lb />
			displayed by these two defendants despite their conviction, that
			<lb />
			too, while undergoing the sentences of life imprisonment, we had
			<lb />
			passed an order dated 2 nd February, 2012 calling upon the State to
			<lb />
			furnish the following details:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			the expenses which had been incurred with regard to the
			<lb />
			deployment of vehicles and guards;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) defrayment of the expenditure incurred on the provision of
			<lb />
			the transportation as well as security;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii) the provisions which had to be made with regard to the diet
			<lb />
			of both the convicts as well as attending security personnel on each
			<lb />
			of these visits;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iv) payment, if any, made to the hospitals;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(v) authorization for all of the above.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			655. It is unfortunate that the State has been able to provide only
			<lb />
			scanty information limited to expenditure incurred on providing
			<lb />
			escort during some hospital visits and taxi fare, again not for all
			<lb />
			visits.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			656. The State has also placed some calculation of costs based on
			<lb />
			these notifications including the number of guards deployed and
			<lb />
			the time for which the convicts were admitted in the hospital. The
			<lb />
			first hospital visit of Vikas Yadav in the year 2008 was on 31 st
			<lb />
			May, 2008 for which the police has notified expenses incurred as
			<lb />
			Rs.1,845/-. One Assistant Sub-Inspector, one Head Constable
			<lb />
			and two Constables had been deployed in providing security for
			<lb />
			the convict. For 74 hospital visits of Vikas Yadav up to 13 th
			<lb />
			January, 2012 detailed in the annexure, the police has notified that
			<lb />
			an amount of Rs.1,13,702/-was incurred in providing security.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			657. So far as Vishal Yadav is concerned, for 93 visits starting
			<lb />
			from 4 th December, 2003 till 7 th February, 2012, an amount of
			<lb />
			Rs.1,65,963/-has been spent on providing security. 63 visits have
			<lb />
			been made after his conviction, the first being on 5 th July, 2008.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			658. We extract hereunder the report from the Central Jail of the
			<lb />

			Gross Total 1678044/-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			659. So far as the amount spent on providing security of Vishal
			<lb />
			Yadav in his hospital admissions post conviction is concerned, as
			<lb />
			noted above he has been admitted on the seven occasions
			<lb />
			commencing from 7 th July, 2008. The total of the expenditure
			<lb />
			incurred in these seven hospitalisations on the security which was
			<lb />
			assigned to Vishal Yadav comes to a total of Rs.14,75,184/-.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			660. We are informed by the State that as per the guidelines in the
			<lb />
			Notification dated 16 th July, 2007, the &quot;total amount of guard
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 470
			<lb />
			charges in respect of both Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav for the
			<lb />
			period 1 st January, 2009 to 7 th February, 2012 as per the available
			<lb />
			record of their outside visits, OPDs and hospitalization in various
			<lb />
			hospitals comes approximately to Rs.20,77,721/-, a burden borne
			<lb />
			by the tax payer.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			661. These monetary figures are no measure of the colossal waste
			<lb />
			of valuable manpower and scarce human resources as the police
			<lb />
			personnel are constantly required for discharging critical policing
			<lb />
			duties. That the defendants could manipulate and influence
			<lb />
			authority to permit this kind of wastage of services of police
			<lb />
			personnel to guard these two defendants for unwarranted hospital
			<lb />
			visits and admissions is completely impermissible and cannot be
			<lb />
			countenanced under any circumstance.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) The cost incurred on taxi fare during the outside hospital
			<lb />
			referrals in respect of Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			662. In Annexure ‗C&apos; to his affidavit dated 23 rd February, 2012,
			<lb />
			Shri Shamsher Singh, Superintendent, Central Jail No.4, Tihar Jail
			<lb />
			has provided the details of the amounts incurred on taxi fare in
			<lb />
			some of the hospital visits of Vikas Yadav. As per these details,
			<lb />
			for 11 visits between 11 th July, 2008 to 1 st January, 2009, a sum of
			<lb />
			Rs.3,850/-was incurred on taxi fare. In respect of 35 visits
			<lb />
			between 11 th February, 2009 to 13 th January, 2012 to AIIMS and
			<lb />
			the LNJP hospital, the State has paid taxi fare to the tune of
			<lb />
			Rs.14,650/-. The actual outside hospital visits of Vikas Yadav far
			<lb />
			outnumber these 46 visits for which information has been
			<lb />
			provided. Despite court directions, the State is unable to retrieve
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 471
			<lb />
			the complete information and place it before us. For the above 46
			<lb />
			visits, the State has spent a total of Rs.18,500/-on taxi fare.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(c) Amount incurred on treatment in respect of Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			663. So far as the expenditure incurred on the treatment of Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav from outside hospitals is concerned, the following
			<lb />
			incomplete details have been furnished :

			<lb />
			Total
			<lb />
			Rs.23,200.00
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(d) The cost incurred on taxi fare during the outside hospital
			<lb />
			referrals in respect of Vishal Yadav
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			664. Again so far as hospital visits of Vishal Yadav are
			<lb />
			concerned, Shri Shamsher Singh, Superintendent, Central Jail
			<lb />
			No.4, Tihar Jail in Annexure ‗C&apos; of the affidavit dated 23 rd
			<lb />
			February, 2012 has provided the details of the amounts incurred on
			<lb />
			taxi fare. As per these details, for 9 visits between 3 rd September,
			<lb />
			2005 to 1 st January, 2009, a sum of Rs.3,950/-was spent on taxi
			<lb />
			fare. In respect of 19 visits between 25 th February, 2009 to 31 th
			<lb />
			December, 2011 to Batra Hospital, the State has paid taxi fare to
			<lb />
			the tune of Rs.10,750/-. Again, the information furnished is
			<lb />
			hopelessly incomplete and deficient.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(e) Expenditure on the diet of the two defendants and their
			<lb />
			escort in the outside visits
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 472
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			665. The State has informed us that so far as convicts are
			<lb />
			concerned, diet for them is supplied on OPD/outside hospital visits
			<lb />
			by the jail administration through the Central Jail No.6 in packets
			<lb />
			at the time of boarding the ambulance/taxi from the DAP
			<lb />
			Command Room located at Central Jail No.2, Tihar, New Delhi. It
			<lb />
			is further informed that in case any inmate/convict is admitted in
			<lb />
			outside hospital, the jail administration does not provide any diet to
			<lb />
			the inmate/convict and the diet is provided by the concerned
			<lb />
			hospital as per the norms of the hospital.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			666. As per the affidavit, no diet or payment at all is provided to
			<lb />
			the security personnel on escort duty by the jail authorities to the
			<lb />
			guards and the security personnel providing security to the jail
			<lb />
			inmate during such visits or admissions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			667. It is important to note that there is no reference to any
			<lb />
			statutory provisions, rule, regulation or guideline to which the
			<lb />
			above practice is relatable. There cannot be an instance of bigger
			<lb />
			subversion and compromise of discipline which personnel in the
			<lb />
			uniformed services must maintain.
			<lb />
			The commitment of the
			<lb />
			assigned police personnel to their duty would have been
			<lb />
			compromised given their exposure to the luxury of being in the
			<lb />
			private wards, even though in hospitals. The non provision of diet
			<lb />
			or payment in lieu thereof to security personnel for the duties with
			<lb />
			prisoners during their outside visits would have rendered the
			<lb />
			security personnel dependant on the convict and his
			<lb />
			family/attendants for provision of their dietary needs as well. The
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 473
			<lb />
			bonding which would have been created thereby between the
			<lb />
			prisoner and his guards has to have resulted in a consequential
			<lb />
			relaxation of the control which is required to be maintained over
			<lb />
			prisoners. This is amply illustrated in the present case. The guard&apos;s
			<lb />
			presence, thus reduced to mere token, is certainly of no
			<lb />
			significance and would not have interdicted the freedoms enjoyed
			<lb />
			by the defendants in any manner during the visits or the
			<lb />
			admission(s).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			668. We do not know, but the bonhomie generated by the liberties
			<lb />
			shared with the guards during the protracted hospital admission
			<lb />
			may have led to them permitting the aforenoted freedom to Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav during his AIIMS admission between 10 th October, 2011
			<lb />
			and 4 th November, 2011. Even the guards on escort duties have a
			<lb />
			duty to inform the jail authorities about the unnecessary visits or
			<lb />
			stays in the hospitals.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(f)
			<lb />
			Impact of such unwarranted hospital visits and admissions
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			669. Mr. Sumeet Verma submits that there was nothing unusual
			<lb />
			in the hospital visits of the two convicts inasmuch as thousands of
			<lb />
			outside hospital visits are undertaken by jail inmates. Even if this
			<lb />
			figure were correct, it can have no impact at all so far as
			<lb />
			consideration of the justification for the visits by the prisoners in
			<lb />
			hand is concerned. It is well settled that a plea based on equality of
			<lb />
			treatment rests only in legality, it cannot rest on or be claimed qua
			<lb />
			acts which are contrary to law or steeped in violations of rules. We
			<lb />
			are of the firm view that even if such practice is being universally
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 474
			<lb />
			adopted in the jails as claimed, it is completely illegal and
			<lb />
			impermissible.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			670. We are greatly saddened by the situation manifested from
			<lb />
			the fact that persons convicted for heinous offences, undergoing
			<lb />
			life imprisonments are able to manipulate not only jail authorities
			<lb />
			but medical professionals in the most premier institutions enabling
			<lb />
			utilisation of a shield of non-existent medical ailments for
			<lb />
			-outings‖ out of jail. Thereby convicts in a heinous murder
			<lb />
			offence have been permitted creation of a facade of sickness to
			<lb />
			enjoy the luxury of visiting and staying in private wards in private
			<lb />
			hospitals in the company of relative and friends (&apos;attendants&apos;). That
			<lb />
			jail authorities could permit these visits and stays without once
			<lb />
			bringing it to knowledge of the concerned medical experts in the
			<lb />
			jail hospital or the jail referral hospitals and taking their opinion on
			<lb />
			the justification for the hospital visit or the hospitalisation lends
			<lb />
			support to the complainant&apos;s suggestion of involvement. We do
			<lb />
			not know whether these acts and omissions had any element of any
			<lb />
			quid pro quo, but they are completely impermissible even if
			<lb />
			emanating out of a misplaced sense of sympathy towards life
			<lb />
			convicts or out of regard for the status or position of the convict or
			<lb />
			his family. Those placed in positions of authority, be it jail
			<lb />
			administration or be it medical experts, must realise that no one is
			<lb />
			above the law, that each person must be treated equally. That
			<lb />
			imprisonment, especially after conviction, brooks no such liberties.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			671. Be it by actually making or facilitating referrals, or
			<lb />
			permitting visits and admissions, authorising and making payments
			<lb />
			for such visits admissions; or lending tacit support to the same by
			<lb />
			not pointing out/objecting or standing by the same, the liability for
			<lb />
			involvement in misuse of the process of law remains the same.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			672. Merely because other prisoners have indulged in similar
			<lb />
			practices and that the official machinery in jails and hospitals is
			<lb />
			susceptible to such manipulation/influence, with or without quid
			<lb />
			pro quos, would not in any manner mitigate the culpability of the
			<lb />
			prisoner. We may point out that such practice is prevalent because
			<lb />
			prisoners who entertain such intents and expectations exist, who
			<lb />
			actively engage and utilise influence of every kind, (be it position/
			<lb />
			political/monetary/association/relationship) so that official jail
			<lb />
			machinery is subverted/lured/intimidated/persuaded into bending
			<lb />
			rules and regulations, in facilitating unwarranted benefits to
			<lb />
			prisoners. If Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav had not aspired to
			<lb />
			avoid prison stay while undergoing their life sentence, no official
			<lb />
			or doctor in the jail or hospitals would have facilitated their outside
			<lb />
			visits and stays. Why would any jail official or doctors in the
			<lb />
			hospital be interested in keeping the convicts out of jail? They
			<lb />
			obviously reacted to such request by the prisoners and succumbed
			<lb />
			to some kind of influence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			673. The above is illustrated by the fact that there is no allegation
			<lb />
			or material with regard to outside visits of the third defendant
			<lb />
			Sukhdev Yadav who is not financially or politically as empowered
			<lb />
			as Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			674. So far as Vishal Yadav is concerned, the order of the learned
			<lb />
			Single Judge dated 23 rd August, 2004 specifically directed that the
			<lb />
			visit to the Batra Hospital for treatment was to be at the cost of the
			<lb />
			prisoner. The fact that the Tihar jail has not claimed the cost of
			<lb />
			transport and security arrangements for the hospital visits and
			<lb />
			during the hospital admissions from the prisoner, which they were
			<lb />
			bound to do so in terms of order by itself speaks volumes about the
			<lb />
			connivance of prison authorities with the convict.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			675. We therefore, have no hesitation in holding that Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav and Vishal Yadav are liable to bear the costs incurred on
			<lb />
			any count in every unnecessary visit outside and hospital
			<lb />
			admission(s). Inasmuch as incomplete information is available
			<lb />
			with regard to the OPD hospital visits of Vikas Yadav and Vishal
			<lb />
			Yadav, we therefore, propose to pass directions for notional
			<lb />
			payments for these visits.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			676. The State has also for the allegedly incurred expenditure of
			<lb />
			Rs.23,200/-on treatment of Vikas Yadav. As no details are
			<lb />
			available, we shall give him the benefit of doubt on this figure for
			<lb />
			want of record.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			677. In view of the above, it is held that Vikas Yadav is liable to
			<lb />
			pay to the State the following amounts :

			<lb />
			XVII. Power of this court to pass orders with regard to
			<lb />
			unwarranted hospital visits
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			679. Having concluded that hospital visits and admissions were
			<lb />
			unwarranted; that such outings cannot be treated as sentence
			<lb />
			undergone and that public money has knowingly been caused to be
			<lb />
			squandered by these two convicts, what can this court do? Is there
			<lb />
			any way of ensuring that the order of life imprisonment imposed by
			<lb />
			the court is complied with in its real spirit? Or will the court
			<lb />
			helplessly watch the brazen manoeuvrings of these two convicts?
			<lb />
			Can these convicts be permitted to claim the period(s) that they
			<lb />
			spent outside the jail as period of sentence undergone while
			<lb />
			computing the period of imprisonment undergone?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			680. The complainant has prayed for drastic orders based on inter
			<lb />
			alia such conduct of the defendants. Before proceeding to pass any
			<lb />
			orders, it is essential to consider the competence of the court to
			<lb />
			proceed in the matter.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			681. By the order dated 30 th of May, 2002, Vikas Yadav and
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav were sentenced to undergo life imprisonment upon
			<lb />
			conviction for the offence of murder which necessarily means
			<lb />
			rigorous imprisonment. The sentence was passed in exercise of the
			<lb />
			powers of the trial court under Code of Criminal Procedure. The
			<lb />
			manipulations and the conniving by the convicts have enabled
			<lb />
			them to avoid the rigours of the imprisonment in the circumstances
			<lb />
			detailed above. Certainly, this conduct of the prisoners tantamounts
			<lb />
			to violation of the orders of life imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			682. Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. recognises the inherent
			<lb />
			jurisdiction of the High Court for the following purposes:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			to give effect to an order under the Cr.P.C.;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) to prevent an abuse of the process of court; and
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii) to otherwise secure the ends of justice.
			<lb />
			[Ref.: (2011 8 S.C.R., Sushil Suri v. C.B.I. &amp; Anr.]
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			683. It is trite that although the power possessed by the High
			<lb />
			Court under the said provision is very wide but it is not unbridled.
			<lb />
			It has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and cautiously, ex debito
			<lb />
			justitiae to do real and substantial justice for which alone the court
			<lb />
			exists. Nevertheless, it is neither feasible nor desirable to lay down
			<lb />
			any inflexible rule which would govern the exercise of inherent
			<lb />
			jurisdiction of the court.
			<lb />
			Reference has been made in Sushil Suri to the
			<lb />
			pronouncement reported at (2009) 6 SCC 351, Central Bureau of
			<lb />
			Investigation v. A. Ravishankar Prasad in this regard.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			684. We find that the scope of the powers of the High Court
			<lb />
			under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. stands elaborated in the three
			<lb />
			Judge Bench pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at
			<lb />
			(2012) 10 SCC 303, Gian Singh v. State of Punjab &amp; Anr. in the
			<lb />
			following terms:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;53. Section 482 of the Code, as its very language
			<lb />
			suggests, saves the inherent power of the High Court
			<lb />
			which it has by virtue of it being a superior court to
			<lb />
			prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to
			<lb />
			secure the ends of justice. It begins with the words,
			<lb />
			-nothing in this Code‖ which means that the provision is
			<lb />
			an overriding provision. These words leave no manner
			<lb />
			of doubt that none of the provisions of the Code limits
			<lb />
			or restricts the inherent power. The guideline for
			<lb />
			exercise of such power is provided in Section 482 itself
			<lb />
			i.e. to prevent abuse of the process of any court or
			<lb />
			otherwise to secure the ends of justice. As has been
			<lb />
			repeatedly stated that Section 482 confers no new
			<lb />
			powers on the High Court; it merely safeguards existing
			<lb />
			inherent powers possessed by the High Court necessary
			<lb />
			to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to
			<lb />
			secure the ends of justice. It is equally well settled that
			<lb />
			the power is not to be resorted to if there is specific
			<lb />
			provision in the Code for the redress of the grievance of
			<lb />
			an aggrieved party. It should be exercised very
			<lb />
			sparingly and it should not be exercised as against the
			<lb />
			express bar of law engrafted in any other provision of
			<lb />
			the Code.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			54. In different situations, the inherent power may be
			<lb />
			exercised in different ways to achieve its ultimate
			<lb />
			objective. Formation of opinion by the High Court
			<lb />
			before it exercises inherent power under Section 482 on
			<lb />
			either of the twin objectives, (i) to prevent abuse of the
			<lb />
			process of any court, or (ii) to secure the ends of
			<lb />
			justice, is a sine qua non.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			55. In the very nature of its constitution, it is the judicial
			<lb />
			obligation of the High Court to undo a wrong in
			<lb />
			course of administration of justice or to prevent
			<lb />
			continuation of unnecessary judicial process. This is
			<lb />
			founded on the legal maximquando lex aliquid alicui
			<lb />
			concedit, conceditur et id sine qua res ipsa esse non
			<lb />
			potest. The full import of which is whenever anything is
			<lb />
			authorised, and especially if, as a matter of duty,
			<lb />
			required to be done by law, it is found impossible to do
			<lb />
			that thing unless something else not authorised in
			<lb />
			express terms be also done, may also be done, then that
			<lb />
			something else will be supplied by necessary
			<lb />
			intendment. Ex debito justitiae is inbuilt in such
			<lb />
			exercise; the whole idea is to do real, complete and
			<lb />
			substantial justice for which it exists. The power
			<lb />
			possessed by the High Court under Section 482 of the
			<lb />
			Code is of wide amplitude but requires exercise with
			<lb />
			great caution and circumspection.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			56. It needs no emphasis that exercise of inherent
			<lb />
			power by the High Court would entirely depend on the
			<lb />
			facts and circumstances of each case. It is neither
			<lb />
			permissible nor proper for the court to provide a
			<lb />
			straitjacket formula regulating the exercise of inherent
			<lb />
			powers under Section 482. No precise and inflexible
			<lb />
			guidelines can also be provided.‖

		<p>
			685. In the pronouncement reported at (2002) 4 SCC 388, Rupa
			<lb />
			Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra &amp; Anr., the Supreme Court had
			<lb />
			observed that public confidence in the judiciary is said to be the
			<lb />
			basic criterion of judging the justice delivery system. If any act or
			<lb />
			action, even if it is a passive one, erodes or is even likely to erode
			<lb />
			the ethics of the judiciary, the matter needs a further look. In the
			<lb />
			event, if there is any affectation of such an administration of justice
			<lb />
			either by way of infraction of natural justice or an order being
			<lb />
			passed wholly without jurisdiction or affectation of public
			<lb />
			confidence as regards the doctrine of integrity in the justice
			<lb />
			delivery system, technicality ought not to outweigh the course of
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 482
			<lb />
			justice-the same being the true effect of the doctrine of ex debito
			<lb />
			justitiae. It is enough if there is a ground of an appearance of bias.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			686. The limits of the inherent power of the High Court under
			<lb />
			Section 482 were amply elaborated by the Supreme Court in the
			<lb />
			judgment reported at (2011) 14 SCC 770, State of Punjab v.
			<lb />
			Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar &amp; Ors. in the following terms:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;52. The power under Section 482 CrPC cannot be
			<lb />
			resorted to if there is a specific provision in CrPC for
			<lb />
			the redressal of the grievance of the aggrieved party or
			<lb />
			where alternative remedy is available. Such powers
			<lb />
			cannot be exercised as against the express bar of the law
			<lb />
			and engrafted in any other provision of CrPC. Such
			<lb />
			powers can be exercised to secure the ends of justice
			<lb />
			and to prevent the abuse of the process of court.
			<lb />
			However, such expressions do not confer
			<lb />
			unlimited/unfettered jurisdiction on the High Court as
			<lb />
			the -ends of justice‖ and -abuse of the process of the
			<lb />
			court‖ have to be dealt with in accordance with law
			<lb />
			including the procedural law and not otherwise. Such
			<lb />
			powers can be exercised ex debito justitiae to do real
			<lb />
			and substantial justice as the courts have been conferred
			<lb />
			such inherent jurisdiction, in absence of any express
			<lb />
			provision, as inherent in their constitution, or such
			<lb />
			powers as are necessary to do the right and to undo a
			<lb />
			wrong in the course of administration of justice as
			<lb />
			provided in the legal maxim quando lex aliquid alicui
			<lb />
			concedit, concedere videtur id sine quo res ipsa esse
			<lb />
			non potest. However, the High Court has not been given
			<lb />
			nor does it possess any inherent power to make any
			<lb />
			order, which in the opinion of the court, could be in the
			<lb />
			interest of justice as the statutory provision is not
			<lb />
			intended to by-pass the procedure prescribed.‖

			687. In order to ensure compliance with the orders on sentence
			<lb />
			and to secure the ends of justice, it is therefore the judicial
			<lb />
			obligation of this court to pass appropriate orders with regard to the
			<lb />
			unwarranted outside visits and hospitalization of the two
			<lb />
			defendants as well as the expenditure incurred thereon. So far as
			<lb />
			the unwarranted hospitalizations i.e. hospital admission(s) are
			<lb />
			concerned, information on the hospital costs, guards and taxi fare
			<lb />
			for the purposes have been provided and there is no difficulty in
			<lb />
			passing orders. Inasmuch as we have not been provided complete
			<lb />
			documentation with regard to the numerous OPD hospital visits
			<lb />
			and as such, it may not be appropriate to rule on the propriety of
			<lb />
			such visits, and so we are refraining from burdening the prisoners
			<lb />
			with regard to the full costs with regard thereto. We however,
			<lb />
			propose to direct the convicts to make a token payment towards the
			<lb />
			cost of security on which expense has been entailed to the State for
			<lb />
			the security provided during such hospital visits. Other details
			<lb />
			have been noted above.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			688. In addition thereto, appropriate orders are necessary so far
			<lb />
			as the manner in which the period of unauthorized hospitalizations,
			<lb />
			in conditions most unlike the discipline in the jail, is to be treated
			<lb />
			for the purposes of computation of the period of sentence
			<lb />
			undergone in jail.

			Jurisdiction of the appellate court while considering
			<lb />
			a prayer for enhancement of the sentence.
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			689. An objection is pressed before us that while considering an
			<lb />
			appeal against conviction or acquittal, the High Court has vide
			<lb />
			powers but it does not have any such power while considering an
			<lb />
			appeal for enhancement of sentence. It has been contended by Mr.
			<lb />
			Sumeet Verma before us that so far as interference with the order
			<lb />
			of sentence of the trial court is concerned, the same can be
			<lb />
			enhanced only if in case it is held that the order is perverse. In this
			<lb />
			regard, reliance is placed on the pronouncements of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court reported at (1994) 4 SCC 353, Jashubha Bharatsingh Gohil
			<lb />
			v. State of Gujarat. In this case, 12 persons were found by the
			<lb />
			sessions court to be the members of an unlawful assembly.
			<lb />
			Different members were guilty for murder of 10 people. The trial
			<lb />
			court imposed a sentenced of life imprisonment for the offence
			<lb />
			under Sections 302 and 302/149. No separate sentence was
			<lb />
			imposed under Section 120B of the IPC. Some of the accused
			<lb />
			were also sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for three years and
			<lb />
			fine for commission of the offence under Section 25A of the Indian
			<lb />
			Arms Act. The defendants filed an appeal in the High Court while
			<lb />
			the State filed an appeal seeking enhancement of the sentence of
			<lb />
			life imprisonment to death sentence. The High Court partly
			<lb />
			accepted the State appeal and awarded the sentence of death only
			<lb />
			to Jashubha Bharatsingh Gohil, the appellant before the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court. Aggrieved thereby, the appeal was filed before the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court. The observations of the Supreme Court in para 12 on the
			<lb />
			legislative intent and principles which must weigh with court while
			<lb />
			sentencing deserve to be considered in extenso and read thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-12. It is needless for us to go into the principles laid
			<lb />
			down by this Court regarding the enhancement of
			<lb />
			sentence as also about the award of sentence of death, as
			<lb />
			the law on both these subjects is now well settled. There
			<lb />
			is undoubtedly power of enhancement available with the
			<lb />
			High Court which, however, has to be sparingly
			<lb />
			exercised. No hard and fast rule can be laid down as to
			<lb />
			in which case the High Court may enhance the
			<lb />
			sentence from life imprisonment to death. xxx xxx xxx
			<lb />
			xxx Protection of society and deterring the criminal is
			<lb />
			the avowed object of law and that is required to be
			<lb />
			achieved by imposing appropriate sentence. The change
			<lb />
			in the legislative intendment relating to award of capital
			<lb />
			punishment notwithstanding, the opposition by the
			<lb />
			protagonist of abolition of capital sentence, shows that it
			<lb />
			is expected of the courts to so operate the sentencing
			<lb />
			system as to impose such sentence which reflects the
			<lb />
			social conscience of the society. The sentencing process
			<lb />
			has to be stern where it should be.‖

			<lb />

		<p>
			690. Thereafter the Supreme Court noted the incorporation of
			<lb />
			Section 354(3) of the Cr.P.C. into the statute which makes it
			<lb />
			obligatory in cases of conviction for offences punishable with
			<lb />
			death or with imprisonment for life to assign reasons in support of
			<lb />
			the sentence awarded and, in case death penalty is awarded,
			<lb />
			&quot;special reasons&quot; for such sentence. The Supreme Court in para 14
			<lb />
			noted that the judge was under a legal obligation to explain his
			<lb />
			choice of sentence and that the sentencing court was therefore,
			<lb />
			required to approach the question seriously and to make an

			bearing on the question of sentence are brought on record. It is
			<lb />
			only after giving due weight to the mitigating as well as
			<lb />
			aggravating circumstances that it must proceed to impose an
			<lb />
			appropriate sentence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			691. In para 15, the court had observed thus :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;15. xxx xxx xxx Therefore, the trial court did not
			<lb />
			merely, by a cursory order, impose the sentence of life
			<lb />
			imprisonment and used its discretion not to award the
			<lb />
			capital sentence of death for detailed reasons recorded
			<lb />
			by it. The reasons given by the trial court cannot be said
			<lb />
			to be wholly unsatisfactory or irrelevant much less
			<lb />
			perverse. The High Court differed with the reasoning of
			<lb />
			the trial court and almost 5 years after the judgment had
			<lb />
			been pronounced by the trial court proceeded to enhance
			<lb />
			the sentence of A-11 from life imprisonment to that of
			<lb />
			death sentence. The High Court also gave its own
			<lb />
			reasons in support of its view on the question of
			<lb />
			sentence. The High Court, however, did not opine that
			<lb />
			the reasons given by the Sessions Judge were perverse
			<lb />
			or so unreasonable as no court could have advanced
			<lb />
			the same. It took a different view of the legislative
			<lb />
			policy as also of the law laid down by this Court and
			<lb />
			referred to some other judgments of this Court also in
			<lb />
			support of its -reasons‖ to impose the sentence of death.
			<lb />
			The view taken by the High Court, it can legitimately be
			<lb />
			said is also a possible view.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			692. We may also refer to para 17 of the pronouncement wherein
			<lb />
			reliance was placed by the court on a prior judgment reported at
			<lb />
			AIR 1953 SC 364, Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab. It was held as
			<lb />
			follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;17. Prior to the incorporation of Section 354(3) CrPC
			<lb />
			in 1973 when the imposition of death sentence was
			<lb />
			almost the rule and imposition of life imprisonment
			<lb />
			required the trying judge to give reasons, this Court was
			<lb />
			faced with almost a similar situation as in the present
			<lb />
			case. In Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab [1954 SCR 145 :
			<lb />
			AIR 1953 SC 364 : 1953 Cri LJ 1465] , this Court dealt
			<lb />
			with the subject, thus: (AIR pp. 367-68, para 39)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-On the question of sentence, it would have been
			<lb />
			necessary for us to interfere in any event because
			<lb />
			a question of principle is involved. In a case of
			<lb />
			murder the death sentence should ordinarily be
			<lb />
			imposed unless the trying judge for reasons which
			<lb />
			should normally be recorded considers it proper
			<lb />
			to award the lesser penalty. But the discretion is
			<lb />
			his and if he gives reasons on which a judicial
			<lb />
			mind could properly found an appellate court
			<lb />
			should not interfere. The power to enhance a
			<lb />
			sentence from transportation to death should very
			<lb />
			rarely be exercised and only for the strongest
			<lb />
			possible reasons. It is not enough for an appellate
			<lb />
			court to say, or think, that if left to itself it would
			<lb />
			have awarded the greater penalty because the
			<lb />
			discretion does not belong to the appellate court
			<lb />
			but to the trial Judge and the only ground on
			<lb />
			which an appellate court can interfere is that the
			<lb />
			discretion has been improperly exercised, as for
			<lb />
			example where no reasons are given and none
			<lb />
			can be inferred from the circumstances of the
			<lb />
			case, or where the facts are so gross that no
			<lb />
			normal judicial mind would have awarded the
			<lb />
			lesser penalty.‖

		<p>
			693. After so observing, in para 18, the Supreme Court held thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;18. xxx xxx xxx in the peculiar facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of this case, when the occurrence
			<lb />
			took place almost 10 years ago and for the last
			<lb />
			more than 6 years the spectre of death has been
			<lb />
			hanging over the head of A-11, Jashubha, the
			<lb />
			High Court should not have enhanced the
			<lb />
			sentence from life imprisonment to death because
			<lb />
			for exercising its discretion in choosing the
			<lb />
			sentence the trial court had given elaborate
			<lb />
			reasons which it cannot be said no judicial mind
			<lb />
			could advance. Only because the High Court
			<lb />
			looked at those reasons differently, in our
			<lb />
			opinion, it did not justify the enhancement of
			<lb />
			sentence to death sentence. xxx xxx xxx&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			694. The court has thus examined the order of the trial court on
			<lb />
			sentence noting that the reasons for not imposing the death
			<lb />
			sentence as well as statutory provisions had been elaborately
			<lb />
			considered and the trial judge had thereafter concluded that the
			<lb />
			sentence of imprisonment for life would meet the ends of justice.
			<lb />
			Coupled with the factual matrix of the case, it was held that in the
			<lb />
			enhancement of the sentence to award the death penalty to the
			<lb />
			appellant by the High Court was not justified.
			<lb />
			There can be no dispute at all with these well settled
			<lb />
			principles. It is therefore, well settled that the appellate court has
			<lb />
			the jurisdiction to examine reasons recorded by the trial court to
			<lb />
			ascertain whether they were perverse or such as no court would
			<lb />
			have propounded. The court would have no power to substitute the
			<lb />
			sentence merely on another possible view. The jurisdiction to
			<lb />
			correct an error in law would certainly be available to the High
			<lb />
			Court examining the order on sentence of the trial court as well as
			<lb />
			failure to exercise jurisdiction by it.

			695. Before embarking on an inquiry into the facts in the present
			<lb />
			case, it is necessary to notice a recent judgment reported at 2014
			<lb />
			SCC OnLine SC 844, Mofil Khan &amp; Anr. v. State of Jharkhand,
			<lb />
			wherein the Supreme Court has elaborately detailed the manner in
			<lb />
			which the courts will consider the relevant circumstances. In this
			<lb />
			case, the appellants had some property disputes with their own
			<lb />
			brother, murdered eight persons including their brother, his wife,
			<lb />
			four minor children one of whom was a physically disabled child.
			<lb />
			Their mother was the sole eye-witness who supported the
			<lb />
			prosecution case and testified against them. The court summed up
			<lb />
			the principles laid down by successive judgments of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court which we propose to reproduce, highlighting those which
			<lb />
			apply to the factual matrix of the present case:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;18. This Court in the aforesaid decisions has evolved
			<lb />
			the doctrine of -rarest of the rare‖ case and put it to test
			<lb />
			via the medium of charting out the aggravating and
			<lb />
			mitigating circumstances in a case and then balancing the
			<lb />
			two in the facts and circumstances of the case. As a
			<lb />
			norm, the most significant aspect of sentencing policy is
			<lb />
			independent consideration of each case by the Court
			<lb />
			and extricating a sentence which is the most
			<lb />
			appropriate and proportional to the culpability of the
			<lb />
			accused. It may not be apposite for the Court to decide
			<lb />
			the quantum of sentence with reference to one of the
			<lb />
			classes under any one of the head while completely
			<lb />
			ignoring classes under other head. That is to say, what
			<lb />
			is required is not just the balancing of these
			<lb />
			circumstances by placing them in separate
			<lb />
			compartments, but their cumulative effect which the
			<lb />
			Court is required to keep in its mind so as to better
			<lb />
			administer the criminal justice system and provide an
			<lb />
			effective and meaningful reasoning by the Court as
			<lb />
			contemplated under Section 354(3) Code while
			<lb />
			sentencing. xxx xxx xxx&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Thus the relevant circumstances, say age and antecedents;
			<lb />
			weapon used; nature of injury -whether single or multiple;
			<lb />
			brutality of crime, etc., cannot be construed individually in water
			<lb />
			tight compartments, to individually rule on whether they are to be
			<lb />
			treated as mitigating or aggravating but have to be cumulatively
			<lb />
			examined and a view taken of the impact of the circumstance
			<lb />
			accordingly.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			696. The Supreme Court, in Mofil Khan further enumerated
			<lb />
			factors from precedents which have been treated as aggravating or
			<lb />
			mitigating circumstances. In para 18, it was further stated thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;18. xxx xxx xxx The following broad heads have
			<lb />
			been culled out by the successive judgments of this
			<lb />
			Court:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-Aggravating Circumstances:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			1. The offences relating to the commission of
			<lb />
			heinous crimes like murder, rape, armed
			<lb />
			dacoity, kidnapping etc. by the accused with a
			<lb />
			prior record of conviction for capital felony or
			<lb />
			offences committed by the person having a
			<lb />
			substantial history of serious assaults and
			<lb />
			criminal convictions.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			2. The offence was committed while the offender
			<lb />
			was engaged in the commission of another
			<lb />
			serious offence.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			3. The offence was committed with the intention to
			<lb />
			create a fear psychosis in the public at large and
			<lb />
			was committed in a public place by a weapon or
			<lb />
			device which clearly could be hazardous to the
			<lb />
			life of more than one person.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			4. The offence of murder was committed for
			<lb />
			ransom or like offences to receive money or
			<lb />
			monetary benefits.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			5. Hired killings.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			6. The offence was committed outrageously for
			<lb />
			want only while involving inhumane treatment
			<lb />
			and torture to the victim.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			7. The offence was committed by a person while in
			<lb />
			lawful custody.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			8. The murder or the offence was committed, to
			<lb />
			prevent a person lawfully carrying out his duty
			<lb />
			like arrest or custody in a place of lawful
			<lb />
			confinement of himself or another. For instance,
			<lb />
			murder is of a person who had acted in lawful
			<lb />
			discharge of his duty under Section 43 Code of
			<lb />
			Criminal Procedure.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			9. When the crime is enormous in proportion like
			<lb />
			making an attempt of murder of the entire
			<lb />
			family or members of a particular community.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			10. When the victim is innocent, helpless or a
			<lb />
			person relies upon the trust of relationship and
			<lb />
			social norms, like a child, helpless woman, a
			<lb />
			daughter or a niece staying with a father/uncle
			<lb />
			and is inflicted with the crime by such a trusted
			<lb />
			person.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			11. When murder is committed for a motive which
			<lb />
			evidences total depravity and meanness.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			12. When there is a cold blooded murder without
			<lb />
			provocation.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			13. The crime is committed so brutally that it
			<lb />
			pricks or shocks not only the judicial
			<lb />
			conscience but even the conscience of the
			<lb />
			society.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Mitigating Circumstances:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			1. The manner and circumstances in and under
			<lb />
			which the offence was committed, for example,
			<lb />
			extreme mental or emotional disturbance or
			<lb />
			extreme provocation in contradistinction to all
			<lb />
			these situations in normal course.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			2. The age of the accused is a relevant
			<lb />
			consideration but not a determinative factor by
			<lb />
			itself.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			3. The chances of the accused of not indulging in
			<lb />
			commission of the crime again and the
			<lb />
			probability of the accused being reformed and
			<lb />
			rehabilitated.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			4. The condition of the accused shows that he was
			<lb />
			mentally defective and the defect impaired his
			<lb />
			capacity to appreciate the circumstances of his
			<lb />
			criminal conduct.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			5. The circumstances which, in normal course of
			<lb />
			life, would render such a behavior possible and
			<lb />
			could have the effect of giving rise to mental
			<lb />
			imbalance in that given situation like persistent
			<lb />
			harassment or, in fact, leading to such a peak of
			<lb />
			human behavior that, in the facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of the case, the accused believed
			<lb />
			that he was morally justified in committing the
			<lb />
			offence.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			6. Where the Court upon proper appreciation of
			<lb />
			evidence is of the view that the crime was not
			<lb />
			committed in a pre-ordained manner and that
			<lb />
			the death resulted in the course of commission
			<lb />
			of another crime and that there was a
			<lb />
			possibility of it being construed as
			<lb />
			consequences to the commission of the primary
			<lb />
			crime.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			7. Where it is absolutely unsafe to rely upon the
			<lb />
			testimony of a sole eye-witness though
			<lb />
			prosecution has brought home the guilt of the
			<lb />
			accused. While determining the questions
			<lb />
			relateable to sentencing policy, the Court has to
			<lb />
			follow certain principles and those principles
			<lb />
			are the loadstar besides the above
			<lb />
			considerations in imposition or otherwise of the
			<lb />
			death sentence. xxx xxx xxx&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			697. After so enumerating the circumstances, in Mofil Khan
			<lb />
			(para 18), the court stated the principles on which they must be
			<lb />
			evaluated in the following terms:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;18.
			<lb />
			xxx xxx xxx
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Principles:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			1. The Court has to apply the test to determine, if it
			<lb />
			was the ‗rarest of rare&apos; case for imposition of a
			<lb />
			death sentence.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			2. In the opinion of the Court, imposition of any
			<lb />
			other punishment, i.e., life imprisonment
			<lb />
			would be completely inadequate and would not
			<lb />
			meet the ends of justice.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			3. Life imprisonment is the rule and death
			<lb />
			sentence is an exception.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			4. The option to impose sentence of imprisonment
			<lb />
			for life cannot be cautiously exercised having
			<lb />
			regard to the nature and circumstances of the
			<lb />
			crime and all relevant circumstances.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			5. The method (planned or otherwise) and the
			<lb />
			manner (extent of brutality and inhumanity,
			<lb />
			etc.) in which the crime was committed and the
			<lb />
			circumstances leading to commission of such
			<lb />
			heinous crime.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			19. We remind ourselves that the doctrine of -rarest of
			<lb />
			rare‖ does not classify murders into categories of
			<lb />
			heinous or less heinous. The difference between two is
			<lb />
			not in the identity of the principles, but lies in the realm
			<lb />
			of application thereof to individual fact situations.
			<lb />
			Sentences of severity are imposed to reflect the
			<lb />
			seriousness of the crime, to promote respect for the law,
			<lb />
			to provide just punishment for the offence, to afford
			<lb />
			adequate deterrent to criminal conduct and to protect the
			<lb />
			community from further similar conduct. It serves a
			<lb />
			three-fold purpose-punitive, deterrent and protective.
			<lb />

			<lb />

			<lb />

			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			45. The crime test, criminal test and the -rarest of the
			<lb />
			rare‖ test are certain tests evolved by this Court. The tests
			<lb />
			basically examine whether the society abhors such
			<lb />
			crimes and whether such crimes shock the conscience
			<lb />
			of the society and attract intense and extreme
			<lb />
			indignation of the community. The cases exhibiting pre-
			<lb />
			meditation and meticulous execution of the plan to
			<lb />
			murder by leveling a calculated attack on the victim to
			<lb />
			annihilate him, have been held to be fit cases for
			<lb />
			imposing death penalty. Where innocent minor children,
			<lb />
			unarmed persons, helpless women and old and infirm
			<lb />
			persons have been killed in a brutal manner by persons in
			<lb />
			dominating position, and where after ghastly murder
			<lb />
			displaying depraved mentality, the accused have shown
			<lb />
			no remorse, death penalty has been imposed. Where it is
			<lb />
			established that the accused is a hardened criminal and
			<lb />
			has committed murder in a diabolic manner and where it
			<lb />
			is felt that reformation and rehabilitation of such a person
			<lb />
			is impossible and if let free, he would be a menace to the
			<lb />
			society, this Court has not hesitated to confirm death
			<lb />
			sentence. Many a time, in cases of brutal murder,
			<lb />
			exhibiting depravity and callousness, this Court has
			<lb />
			acknowledged the need to send a deterrent message to
			<lb />
			those who may embark on such crimes in future. In some
			<lb />
			cases involving brutal murders, society&apos;s cry for justice
			<lb />
			has been taken note of by this Court, amongst other
			<lb />
			relevant factors. While deciding whether death penalty
			<lb />
			should be awarded or not, this Court has in each case
			<lb />
			realizing the irreversible nature of the sentence,
			<lb />
			pondered over the issue many times over. This Court has
			<lb />
			always kept in mind the caution sounded by the
			<lb />
			Constitution Bench in Bachan Singh case (supra) that
			<lb />
			judges should never be blood thirsty but wherever
			<lb />
			necessary in the interest of society identify the rarest of
			<lb />
			rare case and exercise the tougher option of death
			<lb />
			penalty.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			698. The question which this court has to consider is whether the
			<lb />
			trial court orders dated 30 th May, 2008 against Vikas Yadav and
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav and 12th July, 2011 against Sukhdev Yadav on the
			<lb />
			sentences are premised on a consideration of the relevant
			<lb />
			circumstances as per law, are well reasoned and therefore, cannot
			<lb />
			be interfered with? We shall examine this question on these well
			<lb />
			settled principles.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			699. The learned trial judge in the order dated 30th May, 2008
			<lb />
			has held that the present case did not fall within the ambit of any of
			<lb />
			the principles laid down in Machhi Singh to award the extreme
			<lb />
			penalty of death to the convicts.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			700. Mr. P.K. Dey points out that the learned trial judge has
			<lb />
			erred in holding that the case was not covered by Machhi Singh
			<lb />
			inasmuch as the case is covered under categories I, II and III.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 497
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			701. The above conclusion was based on the finding that as per
			<lb />
			the post mortem report there was only a single injury on the skull
			<lb />
			of the deceased caused by a hammer which, the learned trial judge
			<lb />
			has held that could not be termed as &quot;murder in a brutal or
			<lb />
			diabolical manner&quot;. In so concluding, the learned trial judge has
			<lb />
			held that there were three accused but only one injury was found
			<lb />
			which, is a great mitigating circumstance in favour of the convicts.
			<lb />
			After so holding, the learned trial judge has further held that the
			<lb />
			destruction of evidence was a separate offence under Section 201
			<lb />
			which did not invite the extreme penalty of death. Lastly, the
			<lb />
			learned trial judge has held that it is not the death penalty which is
			<lb />
			deterrent in which a person is hanged to death in a few seconds;
			<lb />
			that to the contrary, it is life imprisonment which is deterrent
			<lb />
			wherein a convict dies every moment in the jail. These three
			<lb />
			reasons have persuaded the learned trial judge to impose the
			<lb />
			sentences which we have set out above.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			702. So far as the order of sentence dated 12th July, 2011, on the
			<lb />
			third defendant Sukhdev Yadav @ Pehalwan is concerned, the
			<lb />
			learned trial judge has held that the murder in the instant case could
			<lb />
			not be described as an &quot;honour killing&quot;; that the offence could not
			<lb />
			be described as extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical or revolting.
			<lb />
			The submissions of the defendant that a single blow by a hard
			<lb />
			object given at the vital body part resulted in the death of the
			<lb />
			victim and that putting the body on the fire was for the intention of
			<lb />
			abolishing incriminating evidence for which act the accused were
			<lb />
			convicted under Section 201 of the IPC. The learned trial judge
			<lb />
			held that the case could not be taken as falling in the category
			<lb />
			where murder was committed with the motive which evinced total
			<lb />
			depravity and meanness and that this defendant was merely in the
			<lb />
			employment of the liquor shop business of the family of the other
			<lb />
			two defendants. It was therefore, held that the case did not fall in
			<lb />
			the category of rarest of rare cases.
			<lb />
			Inasmuch as in both the orders dated 30th May, 2008 and
			<lb />
			12th July, 2011, the learned trial judges have arrived at similar
			<lb />
			conclusions persuaded by the same factors, we propose to discuss
			<lb />
			the findings arrived at by them together.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Single blow by hammer
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			703. It has been extensively argued by Mr. Sumeet Verma,
			<lb />
			learned counsel supported by the submissions of Mr. Sanjay Jain,
			<lb />
			learned counsel and Mr. Chaman Sharma, learned counsel that it
			<lb />
			was a case of a single blow by a mere hammer which is not a
			<lb />
			dangerous weapon and that this factor by itself leads to the
			<lb />
			conclusion that there was no brutality in the commission of the
			<lb />
			offence. It is submitted that this must be treated as a mitigating
			<lb />
			circumstance.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			704. The learned trial judges have been persuaded to hold that the
			<lb />
			death resulting by the single injury had to be treated as a mitigating
			<lb />
			circumstance. The learned trial judges have also observed that the
			<lb />
			case rested on the circumstantial evidence alone.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			705. We find that the learned trial judges have considered each of
			<lb />
			the circumstances pointed out by the defence singularly and not
			<lb />
			examined these circumstances cumulatively to impose an
			<lb />
			appropriate sentence. This is contrary to law. As discussed in
			<lb />
			some detail above, each of these factors by itself is also certainly
			<lb />
			not determinative of whether the death penalty ought to be imposed
			<lb />
			or not.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			706. A hammer is not a tool that is usually found in a tool box in
			<lb />
			a car. There is little possibility of finding a hammer in car. The
			<lb />
			defendants therefore, consciously chose to use the hammer as a
			<lb />
			weapon of offence and carried it with them. In our view, it is not
			<lb />
			the instrument used but the use to which the article is put, which
			<lb />
			would render it dangerous or not so. A hammer used for murder is
			<lb />
			certainly a dangerous article in the hands of the murderers. The
			<lb />
			use of this instrument, in fact, points towards the meticulous
			<lb />
			planning of the defendants.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			707. Let us also examine the victim profile. Nitish Katara was
			<lb />
			born on 20 th April, 1978 and was a young well educated man of 23
			<lb />
			years (para 1836 of our judgment) who had just embarked on his
			<lb />
			professional career on the fateful night.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			708. It has been urged by Mr. Dey, learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			complainant that as per the post-mortem report, Nitish Katara was
			<lb />
			a healthy able-bodied young person who would not have easily
			<lb />
			permitted infliction of the blow and that it would have required
			<lb />
			force to control him even to inflict the single assault. For this
			<lb />
			reason, three persons were involved. It is urged that two of the
			<lb />
			defendants would have been actively involved in immobilizing him
			<lb />
			so as to inflict the hammer injury. There is certainly strength in
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 500
			<lb />
			this submission. It is contended that the post-mortem finding that
			<lb />
			his tongue was out of his mouth would show that the deceased was
			<lb />
			throttled as well.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			709. There were no clothes on the body which would suggest that
			<lb />
			the deceased had obviously been overpowered, throttled and a
			<lb />
			blow of such force inflicted with a hammer, brought for this
			<lb />
			purpose, on his skull, a vital part of the body.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			710. The force of the single blow is apparent from the fact that it
			<lb />
			resulted in a fracture of the frontal bone, lacerations and congestion
			<lb />
			of the brain which lacerations corresponded with the fracture of the
			<lb />
			skull bone and resulted in haemotoma of half litre in the left skull
			<lb />
			cavity. As per the post mortem report, there was only one litre
			<lb />
			blood out of the total blood in the body.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			711. The consideration by the Supreme Court of Appeal of South
			<lb />
			Africa in S Nyathi and The State, (2005) ZASCA 134 (23 May
			<lb />
			2005) of the argument of &quot;inadvertence&quot;, a &quot;conscious decision&quot;,
			<lb />
			&quot;degree of culpability&quot;, &quot;blameworthiness&quot; though in the context of
			<lb />
			a road accident resulting in death, sheds valuable light on the issue
			<lb />
			and reads as follows:
			<lb />
			-14. In S v. Nxumalo 1982 (3) SA 856 (SCA) the court
			<lb />
			approved a passage from R v. Barnardo 1960 (3) SA 552
			<lb />
			(A) (at 557D-E) where the court held that although no
			<lb />
			greater moral blameworthiness arises from the fact that a
			<lb />
			negligent act caused death, the punishment should
			<lb />
			acknowledge the sanctity of human life. It affirmed the
			<lb />
			dicta of Miller J who twenty years earlier in S v.
			<lb />
			Ngcobo 1962 (2) SA 333 (N) at 336H-337B had set out the
			<lb />
			approach to road death cases. At 861H Corbett JA said:
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 501
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;It seems to me that in determining an appropriate
			<lb />
			sentence in such cases the basic criterion to which
			<lb />
			the Court must have regard is the degree of
			<lb />
			culpability or blameworthiness exhibited by the
			<lb />
			accused in committing the negligent act. Relevant
			<lb />
			to such culpability or blameworthiness would be the
			<lb />
			extent of the accused&apos;s deviation from the norm of
			<lb />
			reasonable conduct in the circumstances and the
			<lb />
			foreseeability of the consequences of the accused&apos;s
			<lb />
			negligence. At the same time the actual
			<lb />
			consequences of the accused&apos;s negligence cannot
			<lb />
			be disregarded. If they have been serious and
			<lb />
			particularly if the accused&apos;s negligence has
			<lb />
			resulted in serious injury to others or loss of life,
			<lb />
			such consequences will almost inevitably constitute
			<lb />
			an aggravating factor, warranting a more severe
			<lb />
			sentence than might otherwise have been imposed.&apos;&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			712. The principles laid down in these pronouncements from
			<lb />
			South Africa were cited with approval in (2013) 11 SCC 382 :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(2012) 12 SCALE 719, Soman v. State of Kerala and the court
			<lb />
			reiterated the well settled principles that punishment should
			<lb />
			acknowledge the sanctity of human life, concluding as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;27.1. Courts ought to base sentencing decisions on
			<lb />
			various different rationales -most prominent amongst
			<lb />
			which would be proportionality and deterrence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			27.2. The question of consequences of criminal action
			<lb />
			can be relevant from both a proportionality and
			<lb />
			deterrence standpoint.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			27.3. Insofar as proportionality is concerned, the sentence
			<lb />
			must be commensurate with the seriousness or gravity of
			<lb />
			the offence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			27.4. One of the factors relevant for judging seriousness
			<lb />
			of the offence is the consequences resulting from it.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			27.5. Unintended consequences/harm may still be
			<lb />
			properly attributed to the offender if they were
			<lb />
			reasonably foreseeable. xxx&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			713. The blow may have been single, however, it was not a
			<lb />
			mistake or a result of inadvertence. The blow was a conscious
			<lb />
			decision to eliminate the deceased in this brutal manner. The death
			<lb />
			was the consequence of an intentional and calculated hammer
			<lb />
			injury on the head.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			714. The single blow, that too on the vital part of the body, with
			<lb />
			the intent to kill, was so precise and lethal, that it became the cause
			<lb />
			of death of Nitish Katara. The force of the injury was such that it
			<lb />
			was sufficient to cause death also manifests the ferocity of the
			<lb />
			attack on the deceased.
			<lb />
			We find force in the submissions of counsel that the brutality
			<lb />
			of this crime lay not only in the manner of its execution but also in
			<lb />
			its conceptualization.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			715. A single injury is not the sole criteria to judge the brutality
			<lb />
			of the offence (Ref. : AIR 1931 Lahore 749, Sultan v. Emperor)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			716. The incidence of brutality in the commission of the crime
			<lb />
			and manner of its execution is certainly an aggravating factor. The
			<lb />
			number of injuries by itself is not the sole criteria to assess such
			<lb />
			brutality. Even a single injury being inflicted pursuant to a pre-
			<lb />
			plan and deliberation certainly has to be considered as an
			<lb />
			aggravating circumstance, through brutality by itself may not be
			<lb />
			the sole criteria for judging whether the case is of the rarest of rare
			<lb />
			category. (Ref. : (1998) 7 SCC 177, Panchhi v. State of U.P.) In
			<lb />
			this regard, reference may also be made to the pronouncement in
			<lb />
			Jagmohan wherein the court refers to the murder which was
			<lb />
			diabolical in its inception.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			717. Mr. Mahajan would rely on the pronouncement of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court reported at (1970) 2 SCC 113, Tapinder Singh v.
			<lb />
			State of Punjab wherein the brutal manner in which the offence
			<lb />
			was committed reflected deliberation and pre-planning and had led
			<lb />
			to the confirmation of the capital punishment imposed on the
			<lb />
			appellant by the trial court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			718. We have noted the several precedents where betrayal, when
			<lb />
			in a position of trust, has been held to be an aggravating
			<lb />
			circumstance (Ref. : Ramnaresh)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			719. Therefore, the submission on behalf of the appellants that the
			<lb />
			medical evidence disclosed that only a single injury resulted in the
			<lb />
			death and that this fact has to be taken as a mitigating circumstance
			<lb />
			by the learned trial judges is, in the facts and circumstances of the
			<lb />
			present case, completely unacceptable. The fact that the three
			<lb />
			defendants were able to achieve what they wanted with the single
			<lb />
			injury cannot be considered a mitigating circumstance by any
			<lb />
			measure but must count as an aggravating circumstance. The
			<lb />
			learned trial judges have completely ignored the relevant and
			<lb />
			material fact that the blow was deliberate and premeditated and
			<lb />
			carefully inflicted on the vital part of the body. The surrounding
			<lb />
			facts and circumstances of this case have also not been considered.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 504
			<lb />
			The single blow has been dealt with in isolation and treated as a
			<lb />
			mitigating circumstance which is contrary to law and erroneous in
			<lb />
			the facts and circumstances of this case. The finding to this effect
			<lb />
			is unsustainable even on the principles laid down in (1994) 4 SCC
			<lb />
			353, Jashubha Bharatsingh Gohil v. State of Gujarat.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii) Crime a result of emotional disturbance
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			720. The submission that the crime resulted on account of an
			<lb />
			emotional disturbance is also not supported by the evidence on the
			<lb />
			record of the case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			721. The plan which was executed by the defendants was well
			<lb />
			thought out and meticulously executed. The date (night of 17th
			<lb />
			February, 2002 -Shivani Gaur&apos;s wedding) and time was carefully
			<lb />
			chosen. The precision of its execution establishes the clarity of the
			<lb />
			three defendants.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			722. The manner in which the defendants came to Shivani Gaur&apos;s
			<lb />
			wedding clearly shows that they were under no kind of emotional
			<lb />
			disturbance. We have discussed in the judgment dated 2nd of
			<lb />
			April 2014 that as per the evidence, Vishal Yadav and Sukhdev
			<lb />
			Yadav were not invited to the wedding of Shivani Gaur (a friend of
			<lb />
			Bharti Yadav only). Vikas Yadav was invited to this wedding. Yet
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav had the arrogance and confidence to not only go with
			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav to the wedding venue, but to accompany him to the
			<lb />
			stage and get himself photographed with the bridal couple! We
			<lb />
			have noted the casual attire of these defendants in our judgment
			<lb />
			which also points to the real purpose of their going to the wedding.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			723. The evidence on record establishes that they had deliberated
			<lb />
			on their actions to conclude that the only way of ending the
			<lb />
			alliance between the deceased Nitish Katara and sister of Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav was by eliminating Nitish Katara. The deceased was eating
			<lb />
			his dinner in the company of old friends when accosted at the party
			<lb />
			and had accompanied the defendants trustingly from the wedding
			<lb />
			of Shivani Gaur, completely unaware of the fate which was going
			<lb />
			to befall him. Nitish Katara was alone, unarmed, innocent and
			<lb />
			completely defenceless when he was brutally murdered. The
			<lb />
			destruction of the body of the deceased, concealment of all sources
			<lb />
			of identification and abscondance establish the fact that there was
			<lb />
			no emotional disturbance, that the defendants went about their
			<lb />
			criminal acts with complete clarity.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			724. The murder was not an ordinary murder. It was an honour
			<lb />
			killing which was executed with extreme vengeance. The crime
			<lb />
			was certainly not a result of emotional disturbance. The learned
			<lb />
			trial judge in fact, has gravely erred in holding that the defendants
			<lb />
			were emotionally disturbed also for the reason as it was a defence
			<lb />
			of the defendants that they had no knowledge of the relationship
			<lb />
			between the deceased and Bharti Yadav.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			725. Again the learned trial judges have arrived at such
			<lb />
			conclusion because they failed to consider all the material
			<lb />
			circumstances noted above but only examined the motive for the
			<lb />
			offence as a stand alone circumstance in so concluding.
			<lb />
			pg. 506
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iii) Impact of post offence events
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			726. Let us also examine the post offence events and impact of
			<lb />
			the offence on the family of the deceased. On the 17 th February,
			<lb />
			2002, a dead body was found in a badly burnt position on
			<lb />
			Shikarpur Road (P.S. Kotwali) by one Shri Virender Singh (PW-
			<lb />
			23). On his information, Inspector K.P. Singh reached the spot;
			<lb />
			took photographs; prepared a panchnama and; a site plan. Only the
			<lb />
			left hand fingers and palm were not burnt. Post-mortem was done
			<lb />
			on the 18 th of February 2002 on this dead body of an unknown
			<lb />
			person by Dr. Anil Singhal at the District Hospital, Bulandshehar,
			<lb />
			U.P. whereafter the body was kept in the mortuary. On 19th
			<lb />
			February, 2002, S.I. Anil Somania from P.S. Kavi Nagar reached
			<lb />
			Bulandshehar.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			727. On receipt of information from the P.S. Kavi Nagar about
			<lb />
			the recovery of the dead body, on 21 st February 2002 the
			<lb />
			complainant Nilam Katara and her son Nitin Katara and other
			<lb />
			family members reached the mortuary. The deceased was burnt to
			<lb />
			such a point, that his own mother could only suggest the
			<lb />
			identification from the small size of one unburnt palm with fingers
			<lb />
			of the hand that the body appeared to be that of Nitish Katara. The
			<lb />
			identification had to be confirmed by DNA testing. For this
			<lb />
			purpose, on 21 st February, 2002, S.I. Anil Somania made an
			<lb />
			application before the CJM, Bulandshehar seeking possession of
			<lb />
			the body and its transfer to the All India Institute of Medical
			<lb />
			Sciences (AIIMS) for DNA and finger print examination. This
			<lb />
			application was allowed and the body was removed to AIIMS.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			728. The finger print samples were taken on 22 nd February, 2002.
			<lb />
			On the same day, blood samples of the mother Nilam Katara and
			<lb />
			father Nishit M. Katara were taken for the DNA test as well as
			<lb />
			from dead body which were sent to the Central Forensic
			<lb />
			Laboratory at Kolkata. The finger print expert gave his report on
			<lb />
			25th February, 2002 to the effect that the finger prints of the dead
			<lb />
			body matched the finger prints of Nitish Katara which had been
			<lb />
			obtained from the Regional Transport Office, Sarai Kale Khan,
			<lb />
			New Delhi. This report stands rejected by the trial court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			729. The DNA report however, was received only on the 6th of
			<lb />
			March, 2002 which established the body as belonging to a
			<lb />
			biological son of Nilam Katara and Shri Nishit M. Katara. It was
			<lb />
			only thereafter that the body was handed over to the family of
			<lb />
			Nitish Katara so that they could proceed for the cremation which
			<lb />
			took place on the 12 th of March, 2002.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			730. We have noted the above dates just to bring to the fore the
			<lb />
			magnitude of the vengeance of the defendants and the extent to
			<lb />
			which they went to destroy the body of Nitish Katara after his
			<lb />
			murder so much so that a confirmed identification even by his
			<lb />
			mother and immediate relatives was also not possible. The family
			<lb />
			of the deceased must have died a million deaths as they would have
			<lb />
			nursed such hopes of his being alive from the night of 16 th /17 th
			<lb />
			February, 2002 till his death was confirmed by the report of the
			<lb />
			DNA matching on 6 th March, 2002. How his family would have
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 508
			<lb />
			agonised about his safety and well being during this period. And
			<lb />
			all this merely because Nitish befriended the sister of one of them!
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			731. The hope of the family is manifested from the prayers in the
			<lb />
			habeas corpus petition filed by them in W.P.(Crl.)No.247/2002
			<lb />
			wherein directions were sought for his production by the present
			<lb />
			defendants who were impleaded as respondent nos.7 and 8.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			732. We were informed by Mr. P.K. Dey, learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			complainant that Mr. Nishit M. Katara was so traumatised by the
			<lb />
			loss of his son that he also expired on 3rd August, 2003. It was
			<lb />
			submitted that there is grave threat and danger to Nitish Katara&apos;s
			<lb />
			mother and brother even on date. Mr. Dey points out that Nilam
			<lb />
			Katara is under police protection even on date while his brother
			<lb />
			lives in constant fear from the reach of the defendants in distant
			<lb />
			places. Such has been the impact of the crime on the family of the
			<lb />
			deceased.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			733. Before us, while arguing the appeal, Mr. Ravinder Kapoor,
			<lb />
			learned counsel for Sukhdev Yadav had challenged identity of the
			<lb />
			body.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(iv) Motive for crime and public abhorrence
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			734. We have held that the offence was carefully planned and
			<lb />
			premeditated and the murder was committed in cold blood without
			<lb />
			any provocation. It was committed because the defendants did not
			<lb />
			approve the romantic relationship between Nitish and Bharti Yadav
			<lb />
			-sister of Vikas Yadav, for the reason that the deceased did not
			<lb />
			belong to their caste and because that he belonged to a family of
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 509
			<lb />
			government servants, therefore, not as affluent as Vikas Yadav&apos;s
			<lb />
			family. The unity of their thought, aim and purpose is apparent
			<lb />
			from the fact that the three defendants are of the same caste, two
			<lb />
			closely related, the third an employee at a family concern.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			735. Both Mr. P.K. Dey and Mr. Rajesh Mahajan, learned
			<lb />
			Additional Standing Counsels for the State have vehemently urged
			<lb />
			that the crime invited public abhorrence, shook the collective
			<lb />
			conscience of the society to the core as well as the judicial
			<lb />
			conscience.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			736. The motive which incited the despicable crime certainly
			<lb />
			evidences exceptional depravity and meanness. Caste divisions are
			<lb />
			a menace which the society is struggling to eradicate. The motive
			<lb />
			evinces exceptional depravity, meanness; the crime was socially
			<lb />
			abhorrent and certainly an aggravating circumstance. [Ref. :
			<lb />
			Machhi Singh (para 34)]
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(v) Absence of eye-witness -case of circumstantial evidence
			<lb />
			737. We now turn to the finding that the case rested on
			<lb />
			circumstantial evidence and there was no eye-witness, therefore, it
			<lb />
			was not possible to say who inflicted the injury-therefore a
			<lb />
			mitigating factor. The learned trial judge had concluded that the
			<lb />
			defendants shared a common intention to commit the offences. We
			<lb />
			have agreed with the findings of the learned trial judge. Therefore,
			<lb />
			the absence of any eye-witness or evidence as to which accused in
			<lb />
			particular caused the fatal injury is irrelevant for sentencing
			<lb />
			purposes inasmuch as the three shared the common intention to
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 510
			<lb />
			commit the offence of murder and each would be liable for the
			<lb />
			actions of the others.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			738. In this regard, we may refer to the following observations in
			<lb />
			para 30 of (2009) 5 SCC 740, Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod
			<lb />
			(1) v. State of Gujarat:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;30. The plea that in a case of circumstantial evidence
			<lb />
			death should not be awarded is without any logic. If the
			<lb />
			circumstantial evidence is found to be of
			<lb />
			unimpeachable character in establishing the guilt of the
			<lb />
			accused, that forms the foundation for conviction. That
			<lb />
			has nothing to do with the question of sentence as has
			<lb />
			been observed by this Court in various cases while
			<lb />
			awarding death sentence. The mitigating circumstances
			<lb />
			and the aggravating circumstances have to be balanced.
			<lb />
			In the balance sheet of such circumstances, the fact that
			<lb />
			the case rests on circumstantial evidence has no role to
			<lb />
			play. In fact in most of the cases where death sentence is
			<lb />
			awarded for rape and murder and the like, there is
			<lb />
			practically no scope for having an eyewitness. They are
			<lb />
			not committed in the public view. By the very nature of
			<lb />
			things in such cases, the available evidence is
			<lb />
			circumstantial evidence. If the said evidence has been
			<lb />
			found to be credible, cogent and trustworthy for the
			<lb />
			purpose of recording conviction, to treat that evidence as
			<lb />
			a mitigating circumstance, would amount to
			<lb />
			consideration of an irrelevant aspect. The plea of learned
			<lb />
			counsel for the appellant that the conviction is based on
			<lb />
			circumstantial evidence and, therefore, the death sentence
			<lb />
			should not be awarded is clearly unsustainable.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			739. This was reiterated in (2008) 15 SCC 269, Shivaji v. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra wherein in para 27, it was held that in a case of
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 511
			<lb />
			circumstantial evidence, death should not be granted cannot be an
			<lb />
			absolute rule. In the balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating
			<lb />
			circumstances that the fact that the case rests on circumstantial
			<lb />
			evidence has no rule to play. To hold the fact that the case rested
			<lb />
			on circumstantial evidence as ipso facto a mitigating factor would
			<lb />
			amount to consideration of an irrelevant aspect. It was so declared
			<lb />
			in para 49 of Swamy Shraddananda (2). Merely because the
			<lb />
			conviction rested on circumstantrial evidence is not sufficient
			<lb />
			ground for not imposing the death sentence. The learned trial
			<lb />
			Judges in the instant case have therefore misdirected themselves.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vi) Life imprisonment harsher than death sentence
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			740. In observing that life imprisonment is harsher than the death
			<lb />
			penalty, the learned trial judge failed to consider power under
			<lb />
			Section 432 of the Cr.P.C. to apply for and secure remission of the
			<lb />
			life sentence. The learned trial judges have also not considered the
			<lb />
			aspect of remorse and repentance which was completely lacking on
			<lb />
			the part of the defendants in the present case. Both the learned trial
			<lb />
			judges have overlooked these well settled principles and erred in
			<lb />
			law.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(vii) Post murder conduct -burning of the body
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			741. It is contended by learned counsel for the State as well as the
			<lb />
			complainant that the actions of the defendants after the murder to
			<lb />
			disfigure the dead body beyond recognition and to destroy the
			<lb />
			evidence of the crime display the attitude of the defendants and
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 512
			<lb />
			points towards their being accustomed to criminal activity, a strong
			<lb />
			aggravating factor.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			742. The post offence conduct of the accused specially in causing
			<lb />
			mutilation or disappearance of the dead body is treated as an
			<lb />
			aggravating factor. Expressing strong disapproval of such conduct,
			<lb />
			in para 11 of (1996) 4 SCC 148, Ravindra Trimbak
			<lb />
			Chouthmal v. State of Maharashtra, the court observed thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;11. But then, it is a fit case, according to us, where, for
			<lb />
			the offence under Sections 201/34, the sentence
			<lb />
			awarded, which is RI for seven years being the
			<lb />
			maximum for a case of the present type, should be
			<lb />
			sustained, in view of what had been done to cause
			<lb />
			disappearance of the evidence relating to the
			<lb />
			commission of murder -the atrocious way in which
			<lb />
			the head was severed and the body was cut in nine
			<lb />
			pieces. These cry for maximum sentence. Not only this,
			<lb />
			the sentence has to run consecutively, and not
			<lb />
			concurrently, to show our strong disapproval of the
			<lb />
			loathsome, revolting and dreaded device adopted to
			<lb />
			cause disappearance of the dead body. To these
			<lb />
			sentences, we do not, however, desire to add those
			<lb />
			awarded for offences under Sections 316 and 498-A/34,
			<lb />
			as killing of the child in the womb was not separately
			<lb />
			intended, and Section 498-A offence ceases to be of
			<lb />
			significance and importance in view of the murder of
			<lb />
			Vijaya.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			For this reason, it was ordered that the sentence of seven
			<lb />
			years rigorous imprisonment for offence under Section 201/34 IPC
			<lb />
			would start running after the life imprisonment had run its course.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			743. In (2012) 4 SCC 37, Rajendra Prahladrao Wasnik v. State
			<lb />
			of Maharashtra, the accused left the deceased in a badly injured
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 513
			<lb />
			condition in the open fields without even clothes. The court noted
			<lb />
			that -this reflects the most unfortunate and abusing facet of human
			<lb />
			conduct, for which the accused has to blame no one else than his
			<lb />
			own self&quot;. The death sentence was upheld in this case. In (1999) 9
			<lb />
			SCC 581, Molai &amp; Anr. v. State of M.P., similar conduct was held
			<lb />
			to be displaying no respect for the human body.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			744. Therefore, the finding of the learned trial judge that the act
			<lb />
			of burning the dead body was a separate offence and could not be
			<lb />
			treated as an aggravating circumstance to invite extreme penalty of
			<lb />
			death is erroneous and contrary to the well settled principles which
			<lb />
			would guide consideration of the facts and circumstances on
			<lb />
			record. In fact, in so concluding, the learned trial judge has gravely
			<lb />
			erred in ignoring the fact that the removal of all sources of
			<lb />
			identification and burning of the body beyond identification was
			<lb />
			part of single premeditated plan executed by the defendants.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			745. The actions of the defendants manifest disrespect of human
			<lb />
			body, brutalization and its burning display depraved state of mind
			<lb />
			and lack of remorse, all of which are aggravating factors. Just as in
			<lb />
			Ravindra Trimbak Chouthmal, for commission of the offence
			<lb />
			under Section 201/34 IPC, the defendants are liable for a sentence
			<lb />
			of imprisonment which must necessarily run consecutively to the
			<lb />
			imprisonment imposed for the other offences. Therefore, the
			<lb />
			imprisonment to be undergone for this offence would commence
			<lb />
			after completion of the imprisonment for the other offences.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(viii) Whether the passage of time since the date of commission of
			<lb />
			the offence is per se material for sentencing purposes
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			746. As at present it is argued by the defence that much time has
			<lb />
			passed since the offence was committed and that this factor must
			<lb />
			be treated as a mitigating factor for sentencing. This submission
			<lb />
			completely fails to note an important aspect in many trials. More
			<lb />
			often than not, as in the present case the accused persons protracted
			<lb />
			trials. We have dealt at length on this aspect in paras 1918 to 1924
			<lb />
			of our judgment dated 2 nd April, 2014.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			747. It has been held in several judgments that delay per se would
			<lb />
			not impact sentencing. In (2013) 9 SCC 516, Hazara Singh v. Raj
			<lb />
			Kumar &amp; Ors., it was held as under:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;26. It is unfortunate that the High Court failed to
			<lb />
			appreciate that the reduction of sentence merely on the
			<lb />
			ground of long pending trial is not justifiable. In Sadha
			<lb />
			Singh v. State of Punjab [Sadha Singh v. State of Punjab,
			<lb />
			(1985) 3 SCC 225 : 1985 SCC (Cri) 359] , a three-Judge
			<lb />
			Bench of this Court, while considering the identical issue
			<lb />
			which also arose for an offence under Section 307 and
			<lb />
			reduction of substantive sentence by the High Court, held
			<lb />
			as under: (SCC p. 228, paras 5-6)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-5. … We must confess that what ought to be the
			<lb />
			proper sentence in a given case is left to the
			<lb />
			discretion of the trial court, which discretion has to
			<lb />
			be exercised on sound judicial principles. Various
			<lb />
			relevant circumstances which have a bearing on
			<lb />
			the question of sentence have to be kept in view.
			<lb />
			Before deciding the quantum of sentence the
			<lb />
			learned Sessions Judge has to hear both the sides
			<lb />
			as required by the relevant provision of the Code
			<lb />
			of Criminal Procedure.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			6. In an appeal against the conviction, it is open to
			<lb />
			the High Court to alter or modify or reduce the
			<lb />
			sentence after confirming conviction. If the High
			<lb />
			Court is of the opinion that the sentence is heavy
			<lb />
			or unduly harsh or requires to be modified, the
			<lb />
			same must be done on well-recognised judicial
			<lb />
			dicta. Therefore, we may first notice the reasons
			<lb />
			which appealed to the learned Judge to reduce the
			<lb />
			substantive sentence awarded to the appellants to
			<lb />
			sentences undergone.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			27. While rejecting the similar reasons as stated by the
			<lb />
			High Court in the present case, the following conclusion
			<lb />
			arrived at by this Court is relevant: (Sadha Singh
			<lb />
			case [Sadha Singh v. State of Punjab, (1985) 3 SCC 225 :
			<lb />
			1985 SCC (Cri) 359] , SCC pp. 228-29, paras 7-8)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-7. … The learned Judge then took notice of the
			<lb />
			fact that three co-accused of the appellants were
			<lb />
			given benefit of doubt by the trial court and
			<lb />
			acquitted them although they were also attributed
			<lb />
			causing of some injuries. If acquittal of some co-
			<lb />
			accused casts a cloud of doubt over the entire
			<lb />
			prosecution case, the whole case may be rejected.
			<lb />
			But we fail to understand how acquittal of some of
			<lb />
			the accused can have any relevance to the question
			<lb />
			of sentence awarded to those who are convicted.
			<lb />
			xxx xxx xxx.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			28. Applying the same principles in State of
			<lb />
			U.P. v. Nankau Prasad Misra[(2005) 10 SCC 503 : 2005
			<lb />
			SCC (Cri) 1615] , this Court set aside the judgment of the
			<lb />
			High Court reducing the sentence without adequate
			<lb />
			reasons.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			748. In the case reported at (2014) 4 SCC 317, Sushil Sharma v.
			<lb />
			State (NCT of Delhi), the offence was committed on 2 nd July,
			<lb />
			1995, the trial court convicted and sentenced the appellant to death
			<lb />
			on 3rd November, 2003. The High Court confirmed the death
			<lb />
			sentence on 19th February, 2007. The appeal had remained
			<lb />
			pending in the Supreme Court for six years. In this background, it
			<lb />
			was submitted on behalf of the appellant that there had been a long
			<lb />
			lapse of time since imposition of a capital sentence and its
			<lb />
			consideration by the court which provided a valid ground for
			<lb />
			commuting death sentence to life imprisonment. The court noted
			<lb />
			in para 72 the submission of counsel for the appellant as well as
			<lb />
			various judicial pronouncements which were relied upon in support
			<lb />
			of this submission. The submission was countered by the State
			<lb />
			inter alia on the following submission:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;76. On the aspect of delay, relying on the judgment of
			<lb />
			this
			<lb />
			Court
			<lb />
			in Triveniben v.
			<lb />
			State
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			Gujarat [Triveniben v. State of Gujarat, (1989) 1 SCC
			<lb />
			678 : 1989 SCC (Cri) 248] , the counsel submitted that in
			<lb />
			this case the Constitution Bench has held that while
			<lb />
			considering whether the death sentence should be
			<lb />
			awarded or not, the time utilised in judicial proceedings
			<lb />
			up to final verdict cannot be taken into account. This is
			<lb />
			not a case of delay in disposing of mercy petition. The
			<lb />
			counsel submitted that while awarding death sentence,
			<lb />
			perception of the society is one of the considerations. The
			<lb />
			counsel submitted that this case is one of the most widely
			<lb />
			published and infamous murder case. It is a case where
			<lb />
			this Court must, by confirming the death sentence, send a
			<lb />
			strong signal to the society which will operate as an
			<lb />
			effective deterrent in future.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			749. After examining the several judicial pronouncements on
			<lb />
			award of death sentence, so far as time taken in judicial
			<lb />
			proceedings is concerned, the court pointed out as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;104. We must also bear in mind that though, the judicial
			<lb />
			proceedings do take a long time in attaining finality, that
			<lb />
			would not be a ground for commuting the death sentence
			<lb />
			to life imprisonment. Law in this behalf has been well
			<lb />
			settled in Triveniben [Triveniben v. State of Gujarat,
			<lb />
			(1989) 1 SCC 678 : 1989 SCC (Cri) 248] . The time
			<lb />
			taken by the courts till the final verdict is pronounced
			<lb />
			cannot come to the aid of the accused in canvassing
			<lb />
			commutation of death sentence to life imprisonment.
			<lb />
			InTriveniben [Triveniben v. State of Gujarat, (1989) 1
			<lb />
			SCC 678 : 1989 SCC (Cri) 248] , the Constitution Bench
			<lb />
			made it clear that though ordinarily, it is expected that
			<lb />
			even in this Court, the matters where the capital
			<lb />
			punishment is involved, will be given top priority and
			<lb />
			shall be heard and disposed of as expeditiously as
			<lb />
			possible but it could not be doubted that so long as the
			<lb />
			matter is pending in any court, before final adjudication,
			<lb />
			even the person who has been condemned or who has
			<lb />
			been sentenced to death has a ray of hope. It, therefore,
			<lb />
			could not be contended that he suffers that mental torture
			<lb />
			which a person suffers when he knows that he is to be
			<lb />
			hanged but waits for the doomsday. Therefore, the
			<lb />
			appellant cannot draw any support from the fact that from
			<lb />
			the day of the crime till the final verdict, a long time has
			<lb />
			elapsed. It must be remembered that fair trial is the right
			<lb />
			of an accused. Fair trial involves following the correct
			<lb />
			procedure and giving opportunity to the accused to
			<lb />
			probabilise his defence. In a matter such as this, hurried
			<lb />
			decision may not be in the interest of the appellant.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			750. In W.P.(Crl.)No.77/2014, Mohd. Arif @ Ashfaq v. The
			<lb />
			Registrar, Supreme Court of India &amp; Ors., the Constitution Bench
			<lb />
			of Supreme Court has observed thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Also, time taken in court proceedings cannot be taken
			<lb />
			into account to say that there is a delay which would
			<lb />
			convert a death sentence into one for life. [See:
			<lb />
			Triveniben v. State of Gujarat, (1989) 1 SCC 678, at
			<lb />
			paras 16, 23, 72]. Equally, spending 13½ years in jail
			<lb />
			does not mean that the petitioner has undergone a
			<lb />
			sentence for life.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			751. It has been held in paras 16, 23 and 72 of the judgment
			<lb />
			reported at (1989) 1 SCC 678, Triveniben v. State of Gujarat that
			<lb />
			the time taken in court proceedings cannot be taken into account to
			<lb />
			say that if there is a delay, the death sentence should be converted
			<lb />
			into a life sentence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			752. On this issue, the Constitution Bench in Triveniben stated
			<lb />
			thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;71. xxx xxx xxx The time taken in the judicial
			<lb />
			proceedings by way of trial and appeal was for the
			<lb />
			benefit of the accused. It was intended to ensure a fair
			<lb />
			trial to the accused and to avoid hurry-up justice. The
			<lb />
			time is spent in the public interest for proper
			<lb />
			administration of justice. If there is inordinate delay in
			<lb />
			disposal of the case, the trial court while sentencing or
			<lb />
			the appellate court while disposing of the appeal may
			<lb />
			consider the delay and the cause thereof along with other
			<lb />
			circumstances. The court before sentencing is bound to
			<lb />
			hear the parties and take into account every circumstance
			<lb />
			for and against the accused. If the court awards death
			<lb />
			sentence, notwithstanding the delay in disposal of the
			<lb />
			case, there cannot be a second look at the sentence save
			<lb />
			by way of review. There cannot be a second trial on the
			<lb />
			validity of sentence based on Article 21. The execution
			<lb />
			which is impugned is execution of a judgment and not
			<lb />
			apart from judgment. If the judgment with the sentence
			<lb />
			awarded is valid and binding, it falls to be executed in
			<lb />
			accordance with law since it is a part of the procedure
			<lb />
			established by law. Therefore, if the delay in disposal of
			<lb />
			case is not a mitigating circumstance for lesser sentence,
			<lb />
			it would be, in my opinion, wholly inappropriate to fall
			<lb />
			back upon the same delay to impeach the execution.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Reduction of sentence because of delay in trial or acquittal
			<lb />
			because a co-accused was acquitted are not relevant circumstances
			<lb />
			which would ipso facto effect sentencing.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ix) Possibility of reform and rehabilitation
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			753. It is urged by Mr. Rajesh Mahajan, learned Standing
			<lb />
			Counsel for the State that material for this court to conclude as to
			<lb />
			whether the defendants would not commit criminal act or acts of
			<lb />
			violence in the future and whether there was any possibility of their
			<lb />
			reform and rehabilitation is amply available from the record of the
			<lb />
			trial court in respect of investigation and trial in the present case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			754. So far as the post crime, pre-trial conduct of the defendants
			<lb />
			is concerned, our attention is drawn to the material available on
			<lb />
			record and our observations thereon in our judgment dated 2nd
			<lb />
			April, 2014. After burning the body more than 50 kms from the
			<lb />
			wedding, the three defendants set about creating false alibis and
			<lb />
			absconded from justice. Two of the defendants Vikas Yadav and
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav stage managed their arrest at Dabra in the State of
			<lb />
			M.P. and despite every effort by the Ghaziabad police which was
			<lb />
			investigating the crime, they could not be traced out. The efforts to
			<lb />
			track them included visits to home and the other places which they
			<lb />
			visited. Close relatives of the defendants would not disclose their
			<lb />
			whereabouts. Searches had to be effected in different States as
			<lb />
			well. So far as the third defendant Sukhdev Yadav is concerned,
			<lb />
			he could be arrested only on 23rd February, 2005 whence also he
			<lb />
			opened fire on the police party.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 520
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			755. Ample material regarding the conduct of the defendants
			<lb />
			during the trial is available on the trial court records.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			756. So far as the post conviction conduct i.e. conduct in jail is
			<lb />
			concerned, the nominal rolls have been placed on record as also the
			<lb />
			material which has been produced before this court pursuant to the
			<lb />
			orders passed by us. It is therefore, submitted that there is
			<lb />
			adequate material relating to both, offence as well as the offenders
			<lb />
			on record, which is relevant for arriving at a conclusion on this
			<lb />
			aspect of the matter and that in view thereof, there is no further
			<lb />
			necessity of inducing further evidence or placing more material on
			<lb />
			record.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			757. Let us examine the post crime conduct which can be divided
			<lb />
			into three parts: (i) conduct during investigation; (ii) conduct
			<lb />
			during trial and; (iii) conduct in jail. These three aspects have
			<lb />
			been dealt with elaborately in the judgment dated 2nd April, 2014.
			<lb />
			Mr. Rajesh Mahajan, learned Standing Counsel for the State has
			<lb />
			tabulated these circumstances as considered in depth in the
			<lb />
			judgment which for convenience, we extract hereunder:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;CONDUCT POST CRIME DURING INVESTIGATION
			<lb />
			a)
			<lb />
			In Para 72 of the judgment of conviction dated 2.4.2014,
			<lb />
			discussed the arrest of two of the accused being stage managed
			<lb />
			with definite purpose followed by dramatic entry of third accused
			<lb />
			who was arrested after firing at a police patrol party.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			b)
			<lb />
			In Para 782 of the judgment, this Court has observed as to
			<lb />
			how the appellants delayed and hampered investigation by
			<lb />
			misleading the police tream at the time of the recovery of the Tata
			<lb />
			Safari vehicle.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			c)
			<lb />
			In Para 792 and 793 of the judgment, this Court has laid
			<lb />
			down the manner in which the accused Vikas and Vishal
			<lb />
			obstructed the police team in obtaining their custody and remand
			<lb />
			from PS Dabra by first raising objections to the order allowing the
			<lb />
			police remand and then delaying the handing over by stating that a
			<lb />
			writ petition has been filed in the High Court of Allahabad which
			<lb />
			eventually delayed the remand till the next day.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			d)
			<lb />
			In para 801, how the accused misled the police to an inter-
			<lb />
			state trip to Alwar, Rajasthan for recovery of Tata Safari.
			<lb />
			Thereafter they disclosed that vehicle could be in UP or Punjab.
			<lb />
			On 9.3.02, they led police team to Panipat, from where the vehicle
			<lb />
			was finally recovered from burnt factory premises of Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav&apos;s father in Karnal.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			e) In Para 1421 and 1422 of the judgment, this Court has observed
			<lb />
			the manner in which, after their arrest, the accused persons avoided
			<lb />
			their custody being handed over to the Ghaziabad police by filing
			<lb />
			frivolous applications and objections before the court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			f) In para 1581, finding has been returned that accused persons
			<lb />
			were absconding. Further, they stage managed their arrest from
			<lb />
			outside maalgodown at Dabra as they wielded influence in Dabra.
			<lb />
			Consequently, they delayed their custody being handed over to
			<lb />
			Ghaziabad Police. This is followed by discussion on absondance
			<lb />
			of Sukhdev Yadav.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			g) In Para 1603 of the judgment, this Court has stated as to how the
			<lb />
			accused persons have violated statutory provisions and obstructed
			<lb />
			justice with respect to the abscondance of Sukhdev Yadav which is
			<lb />
			stated to be a part of a design in order to pressurize and exhaust the
			<lb />
			witnesses and take advantage of fading memories of the witnesses
			<lb />
			due to passage of time and thus resulting in contradictions and
			<lb />
			omissions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			h) In para 1611, the conduct of the accused in making no voluntary
			<lb />
			efforts to join investigation is discussed.
			<lb />
			In para 1612, Sukhdev Yadav opening fire at police party
			<lb />
			when he was challenged and recovery of arms and ammunition
			<lb />
			from him and his arrest on 23 rd February, 2005 are discussed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			i) In Para 1870 to 1880 of the judgment, this Court records the
			<lb />
			influence of the defendants resulting in deliberate lapses, gaps and
			<lb />
			defects left in the investigation. These included avoidance of
			<lb />
			taking on record by the investigating officer of best evidence of
			<lb />
			motive in the form of cards, albums etc., as the IO was under the
			<lb />
			influence of the family of the accused persons; IO not visiting the
			<lb />
			spot till February 28, 2002 leading to loss of crucial evidence; IO
			<lb />
			not obtaining report with regard to presence of any inflammable
			<lb />
			circumstance on the body of the deceased, nor lifting of soil, burnt
			<lb />
			ash for chemical examination; IO not recording certain facts in
			<lb />
			statement of Nilam Katara u/s 161 Cr.P.C.; lapse on the part of the
			<lb />
			IO in not seeking opinion of doctor with regard to recovered
			<lb />
			hammer and not making sketch of hammer; mistake by prosecution
			<lb />
			in dropping Bharti Yadav as witness on March 30, 2005; mistake
			<lb />
			in exhibiting statement of Kamal Kishore u/s 161 Cr.P.C.; failure
			<lb />
			on the part of IO to analyse the call records and documents,
			<lb />
			verification of emails; non conduct of TIP.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			j) In Para 1881, this court lamented the shocking state of affairs
			<lb />
			wherein Bharti Yadav, an educated 23 year old young lady, was
			<lb />
			terrorized and physically confined by her immediate family and
			<lb />
			brow-beaten into submission.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			k) In para 1966, the aspects of Vikas and Vishal misleading the
			<lb />
			investigations with regard to recovery of Tata Safari are discussed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			CONDUCT DURING TRIAL:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			a) In Para 71, it is pointed out how in the first trial, out of 43
			<lb />
			witnesses, all except one, including police officials, had to be
			<lb />
			declared hostile or were won over and influenced.
			<lb />
			b) In Para 73 and Para 446 of the judgment, this Court has stated as
			<lb />
			to how the well-placed accused persons had put pressure on the
			<lb />
			public witnesses as well as the public prosecutor in the case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			c) In Para 76, obstruction of trial, subverting due process,
			<lb />
			suborning witnesses and leading false evidence on the part of
			<lb />
			accused is discussed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			d) Para 78, intimidation of witnesses, suggestion of answers to not
			<lb />
			only defence but also prosecution witnesses, to compel
			<lb />
			contradictions and omissions on record, setting up false pleas in
			<lb />
			applications and leading false evidence are discussed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			e) In para 81 control over appearance of witnesses in court and
			<lb />
			successful avoidance from testifying of Bharti Yadav for over three
			<lb />
			and a half years is discussed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			f) In Para 160, Para 163, Para 189-191, Para 996 and Para 2024 of
			<lb />
			the judgment, this Court has illustrated the pressure which had
			<lb />
			been put on PW Bharti Singh Yadav, both prior to the incident and
			<lb />
			subsequent to the incident wherein she was spirited away from her
			<lb />
			house to Faridabad and out of India subsequently, in order to save
			<lb />
			her brothers at all costs. This court observed that such facts have
			<lb />
			been denied by her which stand established by documentary
			<lb />
			evidence and any testimony to the contrary cannot be relied on.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			g) In Para 392 and Para 393, this Court has stated as to how the
			<lb />
			testimony of PW42, Bhawna Yadav, was tutored to favour the
			<lb />
			accused persons as she initially denied all questions put to her and
			<lb />
			on a later date changed her stand to depose that she does not
			<lb />
			remember the number of times she had spoken on the phone to
			<lb />
			Nilam Katara, Nitish Katara, Bharat Diwakar and Gaurav Gupta.
			<lb />
			h) In Para 602, 603 and Para 1999 of the judgment, this Court has
			<lb />
			deprecated the arrogance with which the appellants conducted
			<lb />
			themselves during trial and the impunity with which they had set
			<lb />
			up a false defence which reeks of the sense that they deem
			<lb />
			themselves to be above the law.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			i) In Para 719 of the judgment, this Court has stated as to how PW
			<lb />
			23 who is stated to be a witness to the recovery of the body is
			<lb />
			influenced by the accused persons in so far as in his testimony in
			<lb />
			court he could not give the time and date when he saw the police at
			<lb />
			the spot where the body was found.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(j)
			<lb />
			In para 827, a finding was returned with regard to Vikas and
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav setting up a false plea that they had gone to wedding
			<lb />
			of Shivani Gaur on February 16, 2002 not in a Tata Safari but in a
			<lb />
			Mercedes Car.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(k) In para 837 to 839 the aspect of doctored photograph Ex PW
			<lb />
			6/D3 showing deceased wearing a round watch with metallic chain
			<lb />
			is discussed. This is followed by discussion on PW-6 Archana
			<lb />
			Sharma acting at the instance of accused persons and production of
			<lb />
			photographs by her which were not genuine.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(l)
			<lb />
			In Para 841 of the judgment, this Court while dealing with
			<lb />
			the deposition of PW-15, Vijay Kumar, has stated the manner in
			<lb />
			which the accused persons had influenced the said witness in
			<lb />
			supporting their defence plea by producing morphed photographs.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(m) In Para 1063 of the judgment, this Court while considering
			<lb />
			the testimony of PW 32, Ct. Satender Pal Singh, has noted the
			<lb />
			pressure which was upon him as regards his testimony which was
			<lb />
			evident from the sense of hopelessness expressed by him and that
			<lb />
			despite best assurances from the trial court, the same failed to instil
			<lb />
			confidence and as sense of security in him.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(n) In Para 1069 and Para 1930 of the judgment, this Court has
			<lb />
			expressed its view upon the testimony of PW 32 and PW 28 stating
			<lb />
			that they reflect the manner in which the police constables had
			<lb />
			either been won over or sufficiently intimidated to resile from the
			<lb />
			statement under Section 161 CrPC.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(o) In Para 1431 of the judgment, it has been held that to negate
			<lb />
			the prosecution allegation of abscondance all accused led defence
			<lb />
			evidence of plea of alibi, which ultimately was found to be false.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(p) In Para 1613, the conclusion with regard to the plea of alibi
			<lb />
			being proved to be false is discussed.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(q) In Para 1695, Para 1698, Para 1699 and Para 1940 of the
			<lb />
			judgment, this Court has reflected upon how Bharat Diwakar (PW
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			25) and Gaurav Gupta (PW 26) were won over and influenced by
			<lb />
			the accused persons as during their examination in court they
			<lb />
			resiled from the statements made to the police in order to dilute the
			<lb />
			prosecution story.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(r)
			<lb />
			In Para 1840, Para 1842, Para 1926 and Para 1995 of the
			<lb />
			judgment, this Court has observed the duress faced by PW 33, Ajay
			<lb />
			Kumar, who expressed that he had received threats to his and his
			<lb />
			family&apos;s life and to be roped in false cases at the instance of the
			<lb />
			accused persons in order to make him change his statement and
			<lb />
			give a favourable statement in favour of the accused persons. He
			<lb />
			further stated that threats were also received from police officials
			<lb />
			and that he had apprehension to his life and security.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(s)
			<lb />
			In Para 1917, this court under eight different heads has
			<lb />
			elaborately discussed the conduct of the accused persons.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(t)
			<lb />
			In Para 1918, the setting up of false pleas that Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
			and Vishal Yadav were at the house of DW-1 at the time when they
			<lb />
			were spotted by Ajay Katara and subsequently their alibi from
			<lb />
			February 17 to 23, 2002 and alibi of Sukhdev Yadav that he was in
			<lb />
			his native village; this is followed by leading false evidence about
			<lb />
			going to marriage of Shivani Gaur in a Mercedes and not a Tata
			<lb />
			Safari.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(u) In sub paras (c) to Para 1918 and subsequent paras upto Para
			<lb />
			1923 of the judgment, this Court had made categorical observation
			<lb />
			as regards the delay caused to the trial by the accused persons by
			<lb />
			deliberately avoiding the appearance of PW 38, Bharti Singh
			<lb />
			Yadav, before the trial court on one pretext or the other. The court
			<lb />
			observed that how her movements after the incident were
			<lb />
			orchestrated by her family members as she was shifted out of
			<lb />
			Ghaziabad and eventually sent to the UK. The statement under
			<lb />
			Section 161 CrPC was also recorded in the presence of her father.
			<lb />
			This Court had also observed that the address provided of the said
			<lb />
			witness was also incorrect as a Nottingham address was given
			<lb />
			while she was staying in London. The witness finally appeared
			<lb />
			only when steps were taken to revoke her passport. The court
			<lb />
			made strong observations with regard to influence, reach and sheer
			<lb />
			arrogance of the accused and the impunity with which the court
			<lb />
			orders were flouted and undertakings to produce the witness were
			<lb />
			repeatedly violated, reflecting the mindset of the accused persons
			<lb />
			in para 1923.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(v) In Paras 1925-1926 intimidation of witness Ajay
			<lb />
			Kumar/Katara is discussed in detail.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(w) In Para 1927, it is observed that the record reflects that the
			<lb />
			accused in the present case wielded political influence as well as
			<lb />
			economic and physical power. As a result thereof various
			<lb />
			witnesses deposed either out of fear, pressure, threat or because of
			<lb />
			the influence of their relationship with accused persons. The
			<lb />
			variations in the evidence of the witnesses between the statements
			<lb />
			u/s 161 CrPC and court testimonies establish the pressure borne by
			<lb />
			the witnesses. The witnesses included Shivani Arora nee Gaur,
			<lb />
			BhawnaYadav, Ct. Inderjeet Singh, Ct. Satender Pal Singh, Rohit
			<lb />
			Gaur, Bharat Diwakar, Gaurav Gupta and Virender Singh.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(x) In Para 1929 and Para 1959 of the judgment, it has been
			<lb />
			observed as to how the defence has worked as a part of a design in
			<lb />
			defeating the prosecution case by manufacturing a false defence so
			<lb />
			much as the witnesses resile in their testimonies given in the court
			<lb />
			on the same aspects. This Court had infact considered criminal
			<lb />
			action against the witnesses deposing falsely bt took a lenient view
			<lb />
			taking into consideration the lapse of time.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			(y) In Paras 1935-1943 of the judgment, it is stated as to how
			<lb />
			PW 8, Rohit Gaur (in Sukhdev Yadav trial) too had turned hostile
			<lb />
			to the extent of not remembering who accompanied Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
			to the wedding and further denying making any statement to the
			<lb />
			police.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(z) In Para 1942-1943 of the judgment, this Court observed that,
			<lb />
			during the trial there were instances of shouting in court and blatant
			<lb />
			tutoring of witnesses inside the court and preventing the
			<lb />
			testimonies from being recorded, and thereby displaying no respect
			<lb />
			for process of law are discussed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			aa) In para 1944, the defence counsels tutoring and suggesting
			<lb />
			answers to the witnesses is discussed. Bharat Diwakar being under
			<lb />
			the influence of accused persons is discussed in para 1945; defence
			<lb />
			counsel suggesting answers to DW-3 Rajender Chaudhary finds
			<lb />
			mention in para 1946; interference by defence counsel during
			<lb />
			examination of DW-1 finds mention in para 1948; Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
			whispering in the ear of PW-15 Vikram Garg and observations
			<lb />
			with regard to obstruction of trial are discussed in para 1949; the
			<lb />
			design in improvements, contradictions and facts resiled from by
			<lb />
			the witnesses finds mention in para 1958.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			bb) In Para 71, Para 1953, Para 1955, Para 1957, Para 1994 as
			<lb />
			well as in Para 2004 of the judgment, this Court has stated as to
			<lb />
			how police witnesses and other crucial witnesses such as Bharti
			<lb />
			Yadav, Bhawna Yadav, Shivani Gaur etc. had been either won over
			<lb />
			or influenced by or on behalf of the accused persons.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			cc) In Paras 79, 1972 and 1973 of the judgment, this Court has
			<lb />
			observed as to how the accused person tried their best to brow-beat
			<lb />
			and intimidate the prosecutors who were conducting the
			<lb />
			prosecution of the case, by sending legal notice, filing complaints
			<lb />
			and civil suits against the prosecutors.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			dd) In Paras 1987 and 1988 of the judgment, this Court has
			<lb />
			noted as to how the accused persons had manipulated the court
			<lb />
			records to include papers which were seemingly introduced after
			<lb />
			the passing of the judgment.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			758. In para 2004 of our judgment dated 2 nd April, 2014, we have
			<lb />
			been compelled to make the following observations:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-Inference needs to be drawn against the accused
			<lb />
			persons who deliberately misled investigators; suborn
			<lb />
			witnesses; destroy evidence; win over crucial witnesses;
			<lb />
			protract trial so that crucial evidence is lost or forgotten
			<lb />
			by witnesses... The education, economic status, position
			<lb />
			occupied by the witnesses is immaterial when accused
			<lb />
			persons go about exercising influence -it is only the
			<lb />
			nature of influence which may vary -so as to succeed in
			<lb />
			their dishonest designs... This case has distressed
			<lb />
			judicial conscience not only because of manner of
			<lb />
			commission of crime, but also because of the staunch
			<lb />
			efforts made to obstruct the process of dispensation of
			<lb />
			justice...‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			759. Our attention is drawn to the pronouncement of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court reported at (2003) 12 SCC 199, Praveen Kumar v. State of
			<lb />
			Karnataka wherein it was held that abscondance for four years
			<lb />
			indicated that possibility of rehabilitation was nil.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			760. The above narration would show that at the same time, every
			<lb />
			effort was made to weaken the prosecution case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			761. Mr. Rajesh Mahajan, learned additional Standing Counsel
			<lb />
			for the State has pointed out that in the judgment reported at (2013)
			<lb />
			13 SCC 1, Yakub Abdul Razak Memon v. State of Maharashtra,
			<lb />
			cooperation with the investigating team has been taken as a
			<lb />
			mitigating circumstance while non-cooperation, including
			<lb />
			misleading investigators, would be treated as an aggravating
			<lb />
			circumstance. The post crime conduct of the defendants noted
			<lb />
			above must be taken as an aggravating circumstance. In the
			<lb />
			present cases as well, therefore, the abscondance, failure to co-
			<lb />
			operate with the investigators, the pressure put on the witnesses
			<lb />
			and prosecutors and obstructions to fair trials have to be treated as
			<lb />
			aggravating circumstances. These important circumstances do not
			<lb />
			find even a mention in the orders of the learned trial judges.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(x) Family has not abandoned Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			762. Mr. Sumeet Verma, learned counsel for Vikas Yadav has
			<lb />
			urged that the family of the appellant including his mother, father,
			<lb />
			sister, brother and grandfather have supported him at every stage
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 529
			<lb />
			and have still not abandoned him. Mr. Verma has referred to the
			<lb />
			various applications seeking interim bail supported by their
			<lb />
			affidavit. It is necessary to examine the purpose of these
			<lb />
			applications.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Crl.M.B.No.1218/2009 dated 9th October, 2009 was filed by
			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav seeking interim bail for a period of one month on two
			<lb />
			grounds, firstly on the ground that his grandfather Sh. Tejpal
			<lb />
			Yadav was old and unwell and desired to spent time with the
			<lb />
			appellant and secondly that his sister Bharti Yadav was to get
			<lb />
			married on 1st November, 2009 which ceremony was proceeded by
			<lb />
			family functions to be held on 20th October, 2009; 24th October,
			<lb />
			2009 and 28th October, 2009. In as much as the application
			<lb />
			referred to facts relating to her marriage, Vikas Yadav was in jail,
			<lb />
			the facts in regard thereto were supported by Bharti Yadav&apos;s
			<lb />
			affidavit.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(ii) Crl.M.B.No.535/2011 dated 23rd March, 2011, under
			<lb />
			Section 389 read with Section 482 of the CrPC seeking interim bail
			<lb />
			on the ground of re-establishing ties with society and family
			<lb />
			including a 91 year old grandfather. Vikas Yadav had complained
			<lb />
			that his application for his prayer for regular suspension of
			<lb />
			sentence (Crl.M.B. 1301/2008) was dismissed by the order dated
			<lb />
			7th August, 2009. On his application for interim bail (Crl.M.B.
			<lb />
			1218/2009) by the order dated 23rd October, 2009, he was
			<lb />
			permitted only custody parole for a few hours to attend the
			<lb />
			marriage ceremony. He also pointed out that he had filed SLP
			<lb />
			(Crl.) 8592/2009 wherein by the order dated 27th November, 2009,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 530
			<lb />
			his prayer for regular suspension of sentence was not granted by
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court but he was given liberty to approach this court.
			<lb />
			Making grievance that he had undertone nine years incarceration
			<lb />
			and that his grandfather Sh. Tejpal Yadav was more than 91 years
			<lb />
			of age suffering from old age diseases osteoarthritis and deep vein
			<lb />
			thrombosis who earnestly desired that he spends some time with
			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav. In the application, reference was made to activities
			<lb />
			in which Sh. Tejpal Yadav was involved. It was also stated that his
			<lb />
			brother Kunal Yadav was scheduled to get married on 29th April,
			<lb />
			2011; and functions in relation thereto i.e. the ring ceremony on
			<lb />
			14th November, 2009; lagan ceremony on 25th April, 2009 were to
			<lb />
			be held followed by two receptions, one on 1st May, 2011 at
			<lb />
			Chandigarh and the second on 6th May, 2011 in District Badayun,
			<lb />
			U.P. Vikas Yadav also wished to attend kirtan and mehandi being
			<lb />
			hosted by the bride side on 23rd and 27th April, 2011. This
			<lb />
			application was supported by the affidavit of Sh. Tejpal Yadav
			<lb />
			referring to his sicknesss as well as the marriage of his grandson
			<lb />
			Kunal and expressing desire to spent time with Vikas Yadav and
			<lb />
			also for him to make arrangements for the marriage functions and
			<lb />
			participate therein. On this application, Vikas Yadav was granted
			<lb />
			custody parole to attend the ring ceremony and wedding of his real
			<lb />
			brother. Against the order dated 26th April, 2011, also the
			<lb />
			appellant filed a Special Leave Petition being SLP(Crl.) 8592/2009
			<lb />
			(iii) Crl.M.B.No.1741/2011 -Mr. Sumeet Verma has drawn our
			<lb />
			attention to Crl.M.B. 1741/2011 dated 29th September, 2011 filed
			<lb />
			by Vikas Yadav. The appellant prayed for suspension of sentence.
			<lb />
			This application was supported by an affidavit of Smt. Umlesh
			<lb />
			Yadav, mother of Vikas Yadav. The application was dismissed as
			<lb />
			withdrawn on 21st October, 2011.

			(iv) Crl.M.No.10813/2011 dated 8th November, 2011 was filed
			<lb />
			on behalf of Vikas Yadav supported by an affidavit of Sh. D.P.
			<lb />
			Singh Yadav, his father placing the order dated 27th November,
			<lb />
			2009 in SLP (CRL.) 8592/2009 disposing of the petition for regular
			<lb />
			suspension of sentence with liberty to seek expeditious hearing of
			<lb />
			the appeal or move a fresh bail application.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(v) Crl.M.B.No.1944/2011 -On 5th November, 2011, Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav filed Crl.M.B.1944/2011 seeking suspension of sentence of
			<lb />
			four days and release on interim bail to execute a registered general
			<lb />
			power of attorney in favour of his mother Umlesh Yadav to
			<lb />
			manage and control affairs of the freehold residential house no.R-
			<lb />
			4/18, Block-4, Raj Nagar, Ghaziabad. This application would
			<lb />
			obviously be supported by his mother&apos;s affidavit.
			<lb />
			This application was considered on 22nd November, 2011
			<lb />
			when one day custody parole was permitted to the applicant for
			<lb />
			which purpose his counsel was required to intimate the learned
			<lb />
			additional standing counsel for the state and the jail superintendent
			<lb />
			about the date on which he was required to appear before the
			<lb />
			concerned authorities. On such date, the Jail Superintendent was
			<lb />
			directed to ensure that the applicant returns to the jail on the same
			<lb />
			day after the documents are executed.

			<lb />
			pg. 532
			<lb />
			befriend sister of one of them and cousin of another. The offence
			<lb />
			was committed in the instant case on a misconceived belief that the
			<lb />
			defendant was upholding the honour of the family, caste and the
			<lb />
			community.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			764. To keep this sister away from deposing in the court,
			<lb />
			concerted effort was made by the defendants, as well as the father
			<lb />
			and uncle of the defendant for a period of 3½ years. When Bharti
			<lb />
			Yadav gave her deposition, Vikas Yadav sought exemption from
			<lb />
			remaining present in court. During the course of submissions, it
			<lb />
			has been pointed out that the sister of the defendant has been
			<lb />
			married in the same community. It certainly cannot be expected
			<lb />
			that in these circumstances, the family would take a stand against
			<lb />
			the defendants. The filing of the affidavits by the family members
			<lb />
			or family support for the defendants is therefore, of no
			<lb />
			consequence so far as sentencing is concerned.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(xi) Age and antecedents
			<lb />
			765. It has been argued by Mr. Sumeet Verma as well as Mr.
			<lb />
			Sanjay Jain and Chaman Sharma, Advocates that the age and
			<lb />
			antecedents of the defendants necessarily were such that it stands
			<lb />
			established that they had no propensity towards crime.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			766. It is urged by Mr. Sumeet Verma and Mr. Sanjay Jain that
			<lb />
			regard must be had to the young age of the accused, their
			<lb />
			background and socio-economic strata; that Vikas Yadav and
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav are highly educated and have roots in the society.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			767. Mr. P.K. Dey, learned counsel for the complainant has on
			<lb />
			the other hand urged at length that Vikas Yadav has a criminal
			<lb />
			state of mind and that his criminal activity started in the year 1991.
			<lb />
			In his written submissions, Mr. Dey, learned counsel has pointed
			<lb />
			out the following:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Vikas Yadav -(1) He was prosecuted for the murder of Devendra
			<lb />
			P. Singh. The prosecution was withdrawn when his father D.P.
			<lb />
			Yadav was a Minister in U.P. government (2) He was also detained
			<lb />
			under the National Security Act though it was subsequently
			<lb />
			quashed. (3) He was prosecuted in Jessica Lal murder case and
			<lb />
			convicted under Section 201 of IPC. While on bail in the Jessica
			<lb />
			case, he committed the murder of Nitish. The Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			(2010) 6 SCC 1, Manu Sharma v. State (paras 117, 125 and 126)
			<lb />
			referred to his conduct which displayed his scant regard for law.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(4) He was prosecuted under Section 25 of Arms Act at Dabra,
			<lb />
			Gwalior.
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav -He was prosecuted under Section 25 of Arms Act
			<lb />
			at Dabra, Gwalior and he was also prosecuted in two cases one in
			<lb />
			under Section 297/337 IPC and under Punjab Excise Act.
			<lb />
			Sukhdev Yadav -He was absconding for three years, and when the
			<lb />
			police tried to apprehend him, he fired on the police party, a case
			<lb />
			under Section 307 IPC has been registered against him. Led false
			<lb />
			defence evidence (Head No.XV -Pages 849-857, at paras 1588 and
			<lb />
			1600-1603).&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			768. It has further been contended that Vikas and Vishal Yadav
			<lb />
			were arrested in case under the Arms Act on 23 rd February, 2002 at
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 534
			<lb />
			Dabra in M.P. and that they had committed several crimes during
			<lb />
			trial and during custody including tampering with court records,
			<lb />
			threatening prosecutors and prosecution witnesses. They have
			<lb />
			misused their qualifications to subvert the process of law. Mr. P.K.
			<lb />
			Dey has vehemently urged that the antecedents of the third
			<lb />
			defendant would also reflect his propensity towards crime.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			769. Let us firstly examine the profile of the defendants and the
			<lb />
			circumstances brought out on record in respect of the offence. It is
			<lb />
			contended by learned counsels for all the defendants that they were
			<lb />
			of young ages, a mitigating factor. On the night of 16 th /17 th
			<lb />
			February, 2002 when the offence was committed, Vikas Yadav was
			<lb />
			aged 26 years. We have been informed that Vikas Yadav is a
			<lb />
			qualified engineer who had also obtained a degree in Masters in
			<lb />
			Business Administration.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			770. Vishal Yadav was aged 24 years at the time of the offence.
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav had done his schooling from the Delhi Public
			<lb />
			School, Ghaziabad followed by the graduation from the Delhi
			<lb />
			University.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			771. Sukhdev Yadav was aged 27 years at the time of the offence
			<lb />
			and was working in the liquor shop at Buland Shahr, U.P. which
			<lb />
			belonged to the father of Vikas Yadav.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			772. Vikas Yadav has also contended that he was standing for
			<lb />
			assembly elections which were to be scheduled shortly after the
			<lb />
			incident. Both Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav are managing
			<lb />
			several properties and as emerges in the inquiry are extremely well
			<lb />
			placed in life.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			773. Vishal Yadav was even in February, 2002 a well educated
			<lb />
			married man with a child as well.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			774. Sukhdev Yadav, a matured man, was an employee of the
			<lb />
			father of Vikas Yadav and a father of four children at that time. He
			<lb />
			was also not of such vulnerable age that he did not understand the
			<lb />
			import of his actions. The three defendants were certainly so
			<lb />
			stationed that they fully understood the nature and impact of their
			<lb />
			actions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			775. The age of the defendants has been pressed as a mitigating
			<lb />
			factor. The defendants at the time of commission of the crime
			<lb />
			were not so young for their age to come within the ambit of
			<lb />
			consideration as a mitigating factor. They were not of an age
			<lb />
			bordering juvenility but were of an age when they possessed the
			<lb />
			maturity to understand completely the nature of their actions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			776. It is trite that the age of the accused by itself is not a
			<lb />
			determinative factor against award of the death sentence (Ref. :
			<lb />
			Dhananjoy, Jai Kumar, Shivu, Ramdeo Chauhan, Atbir and
			<lb />
			Vikram Singh).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			777. Mr. Rajesh Mahajan, leanred Additional Standing Counsel
			<lb />
			for State has drawn our attention to para 12 of the pronouncement
			<lb />
			reported at (1991) 3 SCC 471, Sevaka Perumal, etc. v. State of
			<lb />
			Tamil Nadu wherein a similar submission was repelled by the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court observing as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;12. Undoubtedly under Section 235(2) of Code of
			<lb />
			Criminal Procedure, the accused is entitled to an
			<lb />
			opportunity to adduce evidence and if need be the case
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 536
			<lb />
			is to be adjourned to another date. There is illegality to
			<lb />
			convict and to impose sentence on the same day. It is
			<lb />
			true as contended for the State that under Section 309(2)
			<lb />
			third proviso brought by Amendment Act, 1978 no
			<lb />
			adjournment should be granted for the purpose only of
			<lb />
			enabling the accused person to show cause against
			<lb />
			sentence to be imposed upon him. Under Section 235(2)
			<lb />
			when the accused has been given right to be heard on
			<lb />
			the question of sentence it is a valuable right. To make
			<lb />
			that right meaningful the procedure adopted should be
			<lb />
			suitably moulded and (sic) the accused given an
			<lb />
			opportunity to adduce evidence on the nature of the
			<lb />
			sentence. The hearing may be on the same day if the
			<lb />
			parties are ready or be adjourned to a next date but once
			<lb />
			the court after giving opportunity proposes to impose
			<lb />
			appropriate sentence there is no need to adjourn the case
			<lb />
			any further thereon. No doubt the Sessions Judge
			<lb />
			needed to adjourn the case under Section 235(2) to next
			<lb />
			date but in the High Court the counsel was directed to
			<lb />
			show any additional grounds on the question of
			<lb />
			sentence. The High Court observed that the counsel was
			<lb />
			unable to give any additional ground. It is further
			<lb />
			contended that the appellants are young men. They are
			<lb />
			the breadwinners of their family each consisting of a
			<lb />
			young wife, minor child and aged parents and that,
			<lb />
			therefore, the death sentence may be converted into
			<lb />
			life. We find no force. These compassionate grounds
			<lb />
			would always be present in most cases and are not
			<lb />
			relevant for interference. Thus we find no infirmity in
			<lb />
			the sentence awarded by the Sessions Court and
			<lb />
			confirmed by the High Court warranting interference.
			<lb />
			The appeals are accordingly dismissed.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			778. It is not an inflexible rule that in every case where the
			<lb />
			accused is a young person, death sentence cannot be granted. The
			<lb />
			final adjudication rests on a consideration of all relevant facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances.
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 537
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			779. The discussion by us would show that the defendants in the
			<lb />
			instant case have no respect at all for the law and the judicial
			<lb />
			system. While on bail in the Jessica Lal murder case, Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav has committed the offence in the present case. It has been
			<lb />
			urged by Mr. Sumeet Verma, learned counsel that Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
			was found guilty only for commission of offence under Section
			<lb />
			201 of the IPC in the Jessica Lal murder case and not for any
			<lb />
			serious offence. Learned counsel would urge that this conviction
			<lb />
			is irrelevant for consideration of a sentence for commission of the
			<lb />
			offence of murder.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			780. Let us examine the allegations for which Vikas Yadav was
			<lb />
			tried and found guilty in the Jessica Lal murder case. The
			<lb />
			judgment of the Supreme Court in the case is reported at (2010) 6
			<lb />
			SCC 1, Sidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma v. State (NCT of
			<lb />
			Delhi): We may briefly notice the essential facts and the
			<lb />
			allegations against Vikas Yadav in this case as they point to the
			<lb />
			mindset of the defendant. On the 29th of April, 1999, Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
			had accompanied Sidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma, Amandeep
			<lb />
			Singh Gill and Alok Khanna to the Tamarind Cafe in a black Tata
			<lb />
			Safari bearing no.CH-01-W-6535 where a Thursday night party
			<lb />
			was going on. At about 2:00 am, Manu Sharma asked for some
			<lb />
			drinks of liquor, however, the waiter did not serve the same as the
			<lb />
			party was already over. On this, Manu Sharma took out a .22&quot;
			<lb />
			calibre pistol and fired one shot at the roof while another shot was
			<lb />
			fired at Jessica Lal (working as a waitress) which hit her near the
			<lb />
			left eye as a result of which she was declared dead in the early
			<lb />
			hours of 30 th April, 1999 at the Apollo Hospital. Manu Sharma
			<lb />
			and his associates abandoned the vehicle while making good their
			<lb />
			hasty escape after the shooting.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			781. On receipt of an information about the incident, the police
			<lb />
			reached the Tamarind Cafe at about 2:30/2:45 am on 30th April,
			<lb />
			1999 and directed PW-30 (Shrawan Kumar), a home guard
			<lb />
			constable to keep a vigil at the parking lot so that nobody is
			<lb />
			allowed to take the cars parked there. While on duty, this guard
			<lb />
			saw a while Tata Sierra vehicle, occupied by two persons on the
			<lb />
			front seats, bringing in their vehicle slowly and stopping the same
			<lb />
			near the Tata Safari. Vikas Yadav got out and opened the Tata
			<lb />
			Safari with a key. Despite being told by the guard not to do so, he
			<lb />
			forcibly entered the Tata Safari, started the vehicle and drove away
			<lb />
			with it. The guard gave a lathi blow on the last window pane on
			<lb />
			the driver&apos;s side on the Tata Safari, as a result of which, the
			<lb />
			window pane broke. The witness identified Amardeep Singh Gill
			<lb />
			who had driven the Tata Sierra and Vikas Yadav who accompanied
			<lb />
			him and as the person who forcibly took away the Tata Safari. The
			<lb />
			Tata Safari was subsequently recovered from Noida on the 2nd of
			<lb />
			May 1999 when a live cartridge of a .22&quot; weapon bearing a Mark
			<lb />
			&apos;C&apos; was recovered from the vehicle. Two empty cartridge cases of
			<lb />
			the .22&quot; with &apos;C&apos; Mark were recovered from the spot of the murder
			<lb />
			and the mutilated lead recovered from the skull of the deceased
			<lb />
			was of .22&quot; which could have been fired from the standard .22&quot;
			<lb />
			calibre fire arm. Manu Sharma admitted that he possessed a fire
			<lb />
			arm licence and that he also owned a .22&quot; bore Beretta pistol made
			<lb />
			in Italy. The weapon of offence was not recovered.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			782. On these facts, while Manu Sharma was charged for
			<lb />
			commission of an offence under Sections 302, 201 read with 120B
			<lb />
			IPC as well as the Arms Act, Vikas Yadav and Amardeep Singh
			<lb />
			Gill was charged with commission of offence under Sections 201
			<lb />
			read with 120B IPC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			783. The judgment of acquittal by the trial judge dated 21st
			<lb />
			February, 2006 was reversed on the State appeal by the Division
			<lb />
			Bench of this court inter alia holding that Vikas Yadav with the
			<lb />
			other co-accused had come to the Cafe in the said Tata Safari and
			<lb />
			was present at the time of the incident. The Tata Safari was
			<lb />
			abandoned by Manu Sharma at the time of his escape which was
			<lb />
			subsequently removed from outside the Cafe pursuant to a
			<lb />
			conspiracy between Vikas Yadav, Amardeep Singh Gill and Manu
			<lb />
			Sharma. It was consequently held that they were guilty for
			<lb />
			commission of the offences under Section 201 read with 120B IPC
			<lb />
			by a separate judgment dated 20th December, 2006. This court had
			<lb />
			handed sentences of two to four years of rigorous imprisonment
			<lb />
			each and a fine of Rs.2,000/-each and in default three months of
			<lb />
			imprisonment under Section 201/120B of the IPC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			784. It appears that Vikas Yadav was on bail in this case when he
			<lb />
			committed the offence in the present case on the night intervening
			<lb />
			16th/17th February, 2002. The judgments in Jessica Lal were not
			<lb />
			placed before us during arguments in the appeals against
			<lb />
			conviction and examination thereof would show a striking parallels
			<lb />
			between the present case and what transpired in Jessica Lal&apos;s
			<lb />
			murder trial. The large number of witnesses turning hostile;
			<lb />
			challenge to identification on identical grounds as in the present
			<lb />
			case; objection to the make of the vehicle; the dispute with regard
			<lb />
			to identification; the grounds on which recoveries were assailed
			<lb />
			and; the nature of the expert witness evidence (ballistic expert in
			<lb />
			Jessica Lal&apos;s case and the medical expert in the present case), are to
			<lb />
			name a few parities.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			785. We find that, just as in the present case, in Jessica Lal&apos;s case
			<lb />
			as well [para 47 at pages 176-177 of] (2007) 93 DRJ 145, State v.
			<lb />
			Sidharth Vashisht &amp; Ors., the Division Bench has noted that an
			<lb />
			application dated 16th August, 1999 was &quot;clearly a plant in
			<lb />
			judicial record&quot;. It was noted that there was no reference to any
			<lb />
			such application in any proceedings of Magistrate and that &quot;even if
			<lb />
			it was filed, it was only an eye-wash, not to be pursued and, in fact,
			<lb />
			it was not pursued at all&quot;. In our judgment dated 2nd April, 2014,
			<lb />
			we have also held so with regard to an application which was
			<lb />
			sought to be relied upon by Vikas Yadav before us. It is perhaps a
			<lb />
			sheer coincidence that in both cases, a black Tata Safari was
			<lb />
			involved and that the city of Karnal has prominently figured.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			786. Though Vikas Yadav was not found guilty for commission
			<lb />
			of the offence under Section 302, but his conduct amply illustrate
			<lb />
			the mindset and the arrogance of the defendant that he could
			<lb />
			actually take away the vehicle which was under police guard. It
			<lb />
			reflects complete lack of respect for authority and the law and
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 541
			<lb />
			manifests a confidence that he is above law, that even the long
			<lb />
			arms of law cannot touch him.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			787. While on bail in this case, Nitish Katara was murdered on
			<lb />
			the night of 16 th /17 th February, 2002.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			788. The circumstances in Jessica Lal murder, the manner of
			<lb />
			commission of murder committed in the presence of Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
			and the manner in which he committed the offence of Section 201
			<lb />
			of the IPC in that case are certainly relevant for assessment for his
			<lb />
			propensity to commit offences in the future.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			789. We also note that the conduct of Vikas Yadav clearly
			<lb />
			displays criminality in attitude as, from being a by-stander in the
			<lb />
			commission of the offence of murder in Jessica Lal&apos;s murder, he
			<lb />
			has been actually involved in the murder in the present case, even
			<lb />
			while standing trial in the previous case. This is certainly an
			<lb />
			important circumstance which points towards the propensity
			<lb />
			towards crime.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			790. Mr. Rajesh Mahajan, learned Additional Standing Counsel
			<lb />
			for the State has pointed out the practical reality that education and
			<lb />
			social eminence is unfortunately inversely proportionate to severity
			<lb />
			of the sentencing. He has drawn our attention to the following
			<lb />
			observations in the pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported
			<lb />
			at (2010) 14 SCC 641 (para 169), Mohd. Farooq Abdul Gafur &amp;
			<lb />
			Anr. v. State of Maharashtra:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-Swinging fortunes‖
			<lb />
			169. Swinging fortunes of the accused on the issue of
			<lb />
			determination of guilt and sentence at the hand of
			<lb />
			criminal justice system is something which is perplexing
			<lb />
			for us when we speak of fair trial. The situation is
			<lb />
			accentuated due to the inherent imperfections of the
			<lb />
			system in terms of delays, mounting cost of litigation in
			<lb />
			High Courts and Apex Court, legal aid and access to
			<lb />
			courts and inarticulate information on socio-economic
			<lb />
			and criminological context of crimes. In such a context,
			<lb />
			some of the leading commentators on death penalty
			<lb />
			hold the view that it is invariably the marginalised and
			<lb />
			the destitute who suffer the extreme penalty ultimately.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			791. In para 73 of our judgment dated 2 nd April, 2014, we have
			<lb />
			observed as follows:
			<lb />
			-73. Despite the investigation being conducted under
			<lb />
			judicial scrutiny of not only the Chief Judicial
			<lb />
			Magistrate, Ghaziabad but also this court in Crl.Writ
			<lb />
			No.247/2002, before us police action has been subjected
			<lb />
			to protracted objections. The trials bring to fore the
			<lb />
			manner in which well-placed accused persons are able
			<lb />
			to put pressure on the public witnesses and public
			<lb />
			prosecutors in the very capital of India, in a trial court
			<lb />
			room not even half a kilometer from this court, and
			<lb />
			barely a kilometer from the Supreme Court, as the
			<lb />
			discussion hereafter will amply demonstrate.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			792. Let us briefly advert to the consideration of the very
			<lb />
			circumstances pressed before us, by the Supreme Court in 2014
			<lb />
			SCC OnLine SC 844, Mofil Khan &amp; Anr. v. State of Jharkhand
			<lb />
			which reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;62. In the instant case, the mitigating circumstances
			<lb />
			under which the appellants seek refuge have failed to
			<lb />
			convince us. The age of the appellants is not a relevant
			<lb />
			circumstance in the present case. They were middle
			<lb />
			aged at the time of commission of the offence and their
			<lb />
			faculties were ripe enough to comprehend the
			<lb />
			implications of their actions and therefore, do not
			<lb />
			warrant pardon of this Court. Secondly, the circumstance
			<lb />
			that the appellants have a family and old aged parents
			<lb />
			etc. does not convinces us, especially in light of the fact
			<lb />
			that the parents themselves have testified against the
			<lb />
			appellant&apos;s act of uprooting their brother&apos;s family and
			<lb />
			their utter disregard for blood relations. Thirdly, the mere
			<lb />
			fact that some of the accused persons of young age have
			<lb />
			been awarded a lesser sentence than death sentence can
			<lb />
			not be made a ground for commuting the sentence of
			<lb />
			death to imprisonment for life. The manner in which the
			<lb />
			crime was committed on the helpless members of a
			<lb />
			family including children of tender age and child with
			<lb />
			locomotive disability and design of the accused-
			<lb />
			appellants to eliminate the whole family justifies the
			<lb />
			grant of death sentence. Lastly, the manner of the
			<lb />
			commission of crime, the diabolic murder of the young
			<lb />
			and innocent children of deceased-Haneef Khan for
			<lb />
			property and choice of the day of commission of crime
			<lb />
			by the appellants belittles the argument with respect to
			<lb />
			possibility of reformation of the appellants and their
			<lb />
			possible rehabilitation.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			63. In our considered view, the -rarest of the rare‖ case
			<lb />
			exists when an accused would be a menace, threat and
			<lb />
			anti-thetical to harmony in the society. Especially in
			<lb />
			cases where an accused does not act on provocation,
			<lb />
			acting in spur of the moment but meticulously executes a
			<lb />
			deliberately planned crime inspite of understanding the
			<lb />
			probable consequence of his act, the death sentence may
			<lb />
			be the most appropriate punishment. We are mindful that
			<lb />
			criminal law requires strict adherence to the rule of
			<lb />
			proportionality in providing punishment according to
			<lb />
			the culpability of each kind of criminal conduct keeping
			<lb />
			in mind the effect of not awarding just punishment on
			<lb />
			the society. Keeping in view the said principle of
			<lb />
			proportionality of sentence or what it termed as -just-
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 544
			<lb />
			desert‖ for the vile act of slaughtering eight lives
			<lb />
			including four innocent minors and a physically infirm
			<lb />
			child whereby an entire family is exterminated, we cannot
			<lb />
			resist from concluding that the depravity of the
			<lb />
			appellant&apos;s offence would attract no lesser sentence than
			<lb />
			the death penalty.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			793. It cannot be disputed that the murder in the present case was
			<lb />
			committed with utmost brutality and shook the collective
			<lb />
			conscience of the society to the hilt. The conduct of two of the
			<lb />
			defendants Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav after conviction
			<lb />
			suggests that their education in good institutions and their
			<lb />
			placement in society, instead of inculcating discipline, has led to
			<lb />
			creation of an arrogance that their position in society places them
			<lb />
			above the law and they continue to exhibit lack of respect for the
			<lb />
			discipline of law. Instead of motivating them to abide by the law,
			<lb />
			even after commission of the crime, they have acted in the worst
			<lb />
			possible manner during investigation; before the learned trial court
			<lb />
			as well as in the jail. In the given circumstances, their age,
			<lb />
			qualifications and social status certainly do not mitigate their
			<lb />
			culpability. Despite convictions they show no concern for society
			<lb />
			and persist in aggressively manipulating the systems.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			794. In the present case, it would certainly be a travesty of justice
			<lb />
			if the age, education and economic status of the defendants was
			<lb />
			accepted as a mitigating factor so far as sentencing is concerned.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(xii) Finding that death penalty is not deterrent
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			795. The learned trial judge in the order dated 30 th May, 2008 was
			<lb />
			further of the view that it is not the death penalty which was the
			<lb />
			deterrent inasmuch as the person is hung to death in a few seconds
			<lb />
			and that it is the life imprisonment which is a deterrent wherein a
			<lb />
			convict dies every moment in jail. These observations may be
			<lb />
			correct if life imprisonment meant the remainder of the convict&apos;s
			<lb />
			life. However, in so stating, the learned trial judge has based her
			<lb />
			conclusions on a personal opinion in ignorance of provisions of
			<lb />
			Sections 432 and 433 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a view
			<lb />
			which has to be treated as unreasonable.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(xiii) Murder -not an honour killing
			<lb />
			796. So far as the order on sentence dated 12 th July, 2011 with
			<lb />
			regard to Sukhdev Yadav @ Pehalwan is concerned, the learned
			<lb />
			trial judge has recorded that such a situation may not describe the
			<lb />
			case as a murder committed as -honour killing‖. This finding is
			<lb />
			contrary to the record as well as our judgment dated 2 nd April,
			<lb />
			2014. The circumstances of the criminal have also not been
			<lb />
			considered by the learned trial judge.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(xiv) Possibility of reform and rehabilitation and its impact on
			<lb />
			imposition of death penalty
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			797. The consideration of the entirety of the circumstances
			<lb />
			established by the prosecution which have been detailed in our
			<lb />
			judgment dated 2nd April, 2014 especially with regard to the
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 546
			<lb />
			meticulous planning and execution of the crimes; the brutality with
			<lb />
			which they were executed and our above discussion on the various
			<lb />
			other factors and circumstances pressed before us certainly brings
			<lb />
			the present case in the category of &apos;rarest of rare&apos; cases. However,
			<lb />
			so far as imposition of the death sentence is concerned, it is well
			<lb />
			settled that a case falling in the rarest of rare category would per se
			<lb />
			not invite imposition of the death penalty but the important factor
			<lb />
			with regard to the possibility of reform and rehabilitation of the
			<lb />
			offender has to be examined.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			798. It is contended on behalf of the defendants that the State has
			<lb />
			not led evidence in accordance with Bachan Singh to show that
			<lb />
			the accused persons are beyond possibility of reformation and
			<lb />
			rehabilitation and therefore, death sentence cannot be imposed
			<lb />
			against the defendants. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held
			<lb />
			that it is open to the court to examine the material in this regard on
			<lb />
			the available record.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			799. We have discussed heretofore the nature of hearing and the
			<lb />
			factors which are required to be considered by the court in deciding
			<lb />
			upon the appropriate sentence (Santa Singh). Both the prosecution
			<lb />
			and the defendant are required to be given an opportunity to bring
			<lb />
			relevant material on record. We have noted the principle that in
			<lb />
			case the State fails to produce any material on record, the court
			<lb />
			could ascertain from the available material on record, if there are
			<lb />
			any mitigating factors favouring the accused. In case a proper pre-
			<lb />
			sentence hearing has not been afforded, it is open to the appellate
			<lb />
			court to do so.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			800. It is thus, well settled that material with regard to sentencing
			<lb />
			can be gathered from the earlier stage of the proceedings. In the
			<lb />
			present case, we have extensively noted the post-crime conduct of
			<lb />
			the defendants. The State and the complainant have urged that
			<lb />
			given the nature of the crimes as well as the conduct of the
			<lb />
			defendants, they ought not to go unpunished and that enhanced
			<lb />
			punishment is necessary to ensure the adequacy of the sentence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			801. Mr. P.K. Dey, learned counsel for complainant has
			<lb />
			submitted that while in custody during trial and post conviction, the
			<lb />
			aforenoticed conduct of Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav in fact
			<lb />
			tantamounts to commission of several criminal offences. He has
			<lb />
			enumerated the following:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;The convicts, especially Vikas and Vishal, have
			<lb />
			committed several offences while in custody; (a)
			<lb />
			threatening the prosecution witnesses being an offence
			<lb />
			under Section 503/504; (b) intimidating the Public
			<lb />
			Prosecutor being an offence under Section 503/504 and
			<lb />
			189; (c) not allowing Bharti to come and depose being an
			<lb />
			offence under Section 173 and 187; (d) absconding after
			<lb />
			the commission of the crime being an offence under
			<lb />
			Section 172; (e) making a false statement being an
			<lb />
			offence under Section 177; (f) producing false witnesses
			<lb />
			in defence being an offence under Section 191 read with
			<lb />
			Section 107; (g) moving false applications in the court
			<lb />
			being an offence under Section 192; (h) tampering of the
			<lb />
			court records being an offence under Sections 196, 464
			<lb />
			and 466 read with Section 107 and (i) escape from
			<lb />
			custody being an offence under Section 224.&quot;
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 548
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			802. It is urged that the above acts were committed by the
			<lb />
			defendants after their arrest and continued till 2013; that these acts
			<lb />
			are not just crimes but more gravely they tantamount to obstruction
			<lb />
			or interference in the of justice and strike a blow to
			<lb />
			the rule of law. Learned counsel would contend that these acts
			<lb />
			prove beyond doubt that the defendants have no remorse and are
			<lb />
			beyond reformation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			803. It is contended by Mr. Sumeet Verma, learned cousnel that
			<lb />
			the appellant Vikas Yadav has undergone lengthy incarceration of
			<lb />
			more than 12 years.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			804. As per the nominal roll placed before us, Vikas Yadav has
			<lb />
			been in custody in the present case since 25 th February, 2002. He
			<lb />
			has gone on custody parole by the order dated 23 rd October, 2009
			<lb />
			on 1 st November, 2009 to attend the marriage ceremony of his
			<lb />
			sister from three hours before the &apos;barat&apos; and till the &apos;doli&apos; in the
			<lb />
			morning. Thereafter by the order dated 7 th April, 2011, he was
			<lb />
			permitted to go in custody firstly on 14 th April, 2011 to attend the
			<lb />
			ring ceremony of brother Kunal at Hyatt Regency Hotel for two
			<lb />
			hours and secondly on 29 th April, 2011 to attend his marriage at
			<lb />
			Umrao Hotel and Resort, NH-8 from 6:00 pm to early hours of 30 th
			<lb />
			April, 2011. These were two occasions when he was permitted by
			<lb />
			the court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			805. However, we have discussed hereinabove that Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
			has repeatedly gone out of jail post conviction on the pretext of
			<lb />
			hospital visits. In addition, he has had an unwarranted hospital stay
			<lb />
			w.e.f. 10 th October, 2011 to 4 th November, 2011 which period we
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 549
			<lb />
			have held cannot be treated as a period during which he underwent
			<lb />
			imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			806. Vishal Yadav was arrested in the present case on 25 th
			<lb />
			February, 2002 and admitted to bail on 11 th October, 2005 as an
			<lb />
			undertrial. He came to be lodged in the prison upon his conviction
			<lb />
			of 28 th May, 2002. It is submitted by Mr. Sanjay Jain that both
			<lb />
			while on bail or when he was granted suspension of sentence, there
			<lb />
			has been no complaint against the conduct of Vishal Yadav. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that he does not belong to the family of Vikas Yadav.
			<lb />
			He is a married man with a daughter aged 12 years and deserves
			<lb />
			leniency.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			807. With regard to Vishal Yadav&apos;s argument with regard to
			<lb />
			marriage of his sister in a different caste, Mr. P.K. Dey submits
			<lb />
			that this marriage took place more than 12 years after the murder of
			<lb />
			Nitish Katara. He further submits that so far as his brother&apos;s
			<lb />
			marriage is concerned, the same did not survive for reasons best
			<lb />
			known to Vishal Yadav&apos;s family.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			808. The closeness of Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav and their
			<lb />
			complicity in the crime and the course of events thereafter is
			<lb />
			evident from the fact that in the record of Batra Hospital, in 2004
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav has given his address as that of Mr. D.P. Yadav
			<lb />
			(father of Vikas Yadav) at 15, Balwant Rai Mehta&apos;s Lane, New
			<lb />
			Delhi. After the crime, they also absconded and were arrested
			<lb />
			together.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			809. So far as Sukhdev Yadav is concerned, he got together with
			<lb />
			the other two defendants who are from the same caste and
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 550
			<lb />
			committed the heinous crimes. He remained absconding for over
			<lb />
			three years after crime till he was arrested on 23rd February, 2005.
			<lb />
			All efforts to arrest him including issuance of proclamation and
			<lb />
			attachment of property were of no avail. Even when the police
			<lb />
			party went to arrest him, he opened fire pursuant to which a case
			<lb />
			under Section 307 IPC bearing FIR No.56/05 was registered
			<lb />
			against him by Police Station Dewaria in District Kushi Nagar.
			<lb />
			Another FIR No.57/05 was also registered against him under the
			<lb />
			Arms Act. Sukhdev Yadav&apos;s abscondance for over three years
			<lb />
			appears to be a part of the clear design to pressurize and exhaust
			<lb />
			witnesses. His culpability for the offence is no less than that of the
			<lb />
			other two defendants though his incarceration appears to have
			<lb />
			chastened him over the last two years.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			810. So far as Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav are concerned,
			<lb />
			despite their conviction for such heinous offences, we have
			<lb />
			discussed and concluded above that while in jail, they have
			<lb />
			ruthlessly misused the process of law and have manipulated
			<lb />
			hospital visits and admissions. This conduct of Vikas Yadav and
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav manifests that there is no remorse or regret. The jail
			<lb />
			stay has also had no impact so far as reformation and rehabilitation
			<lb />
			of these two defendants is concerned.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			811. We may note that, before us, it has not been argued on
			<lb />
			behalf of any of the defendants that they have no responsibility for
			<lb />
			the manipulations which have resulted in the hospital visits or the
			<lb />
			unwarranted admissions. This is rightly so. The defendants are the
			<lb />
			ones who have directly benefitted as a result and have been able to
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 551
			<lb />
			stay out of the Tihar jail for different periods which we have noted
			<lb />
			above. Why would the jail or medical authorities permit such visits
			<lb />
			and admissions unless it was persuaded by them, to assist their
			<lb />
			stays out of the jail?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			812. It is necessary to point out an important factor that there is
			<lb />
			no such allegation of feigning sickness and unnecessary hospital
			<lb />
			visits and admission against Sukhdev Yadav, a reflection of the
			<lb />
			reality that he, not as well placed as the other two, does not have
			<lb />
			the influence, to manipulate authority and systems.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			813. So far as the post conviction conduct i.e. the conduct of the
			<lb />
			defendants in jail is concerned, the following jail punishments are
			<lb />
			revealed in the nominal rolls:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			CONDUCT IN JAIL:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			a)
			<lb />
			As per the nominal roll of Vikas Yadav, he was awarded
			<lb />
			punishment dated 28.05.2012 when 10 cigarettes were recovered
			<lb />
			from him. Another punishment dated 10.07.2013 was awarded to
			<lb />
			him for assaulting a ward sahayak. His jail conduct for the last one
			<lb />
			year is stated to be satisfactory.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			b)
			<lb />
			As per the nominal roll of Vishal Yadav, he was awarded
			<lb />
			punishment dated 28.05.2012 when tobacco was recovered from
			<lb />
			him. Another punishment dated 08.07.2013 was awarded to him
			<lb />
			for assaulting a ward sahayak. His jail conduct for the last one
			<lb />
			year is stated to be satisfactory.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			c)
			<lb />
			As per the nominal roll of Sukhdev Yadav, he was awarded
			<lb />
			punishment dated 10.07.2013 for assaulting a ward sahayak. His
			<lb />
			jail conduct for the last one year is stated to be satisfactory.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(xv) Probationary Officer&apos;s report
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			814. Vikas Yadav has filed W.P.(Crl.)No.1644/2014 impugning
			<lb />
			the order of the Lt. Governor rejecting his application for parole.
			<lb />
			In this case, a report by Mr. Yogesh Chandra Mishra, Probationary
			<lb />
			Officer, Department of Social Welfare Government of NCT of
			<lb />
			Delhi dated 26 th August, 2014 has been filed by the jail authorities.
			<lb />
			Mr. Sumeet Verma, learned counsel for the defendant has
			<lb />
			extensively relied on this report contending that the report
			<lb />
			establishes that the possibility of the defendant&apos;s reform and
			<lb />
			rehabilitation cannot be ruled out. Reliance is placed on the
			<lb />
			judgment in Birju by Mr. Verma in this regard.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			815. This report is staunchly challenged by the State as well as
			<lb />
			the complainant. It is pointed out by the complainant that Mr.
			<lb />
			Sunil Babu, an officer, Ward no.5 of the jail recorded her statement
			<lb />
			on the 2nd October, 2014. Mr. Mahajan, learned Additional
			<lb />
			Standing Counsel has also submitted that no such report had been
			<lb />
			requisitioned by him and that the probationary officer has not
			<lb />
			undertaken relevant issues into consideration nor the behaviour
			<lb />
			pattern of the defendant over the entire period since the crime
			<lb />
			before returning a finding on the possibility of his reformation. It
			<lb />
			is submitted that no sociological or psychiatric appraisal by any
			<lb />
			expert or specialised body was undertaken and that the report is
			<lb />
			premised completely on the conduct of the defendant for the period
			<lb />
			immediately preceding the report.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			816. The report of the probationary officer encloses statements of
			<lb />
			what has been termed as &quot;three neighbours&quot;. It is pointed out by
			<lb />
			Mr. P.K. Dey, learned counsel for the complainant (and not
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 553
			<lb />
			disputed by Vikas Yadav) that out of these three persons, Suraj
			<lb />
			Singh (shown resident of 4/32, Raj Nagar) is a servant of Mr. D.P.
			<lb />
			Yadav (father of the defendant) who stays in the same residence
			<lb />
			while Satendra (residing at 4/17, Raj Nagar) is a son of Shri D.P.
			<lb />
			Yadav&apos;s elder brother Shyam Singh. The third person whose
			<lb />
			statement was recorded is also a neighbour, obviously under the
			<lb />
			influence of the family of Vikas Yadav.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			817. It is complained by the Mr. P.K. Dey that the last two lines
			<lb />
			of the probationary officer&apos;s report indicate his malafides. The
			<lb />
			report does not even advert to the pre-conviction and post
			<lb />
			conviction conduct of the defendant including the manipulated
			<lb />
			hospital visits and admissions. The report also does not refer to the
			<lb />
			fact that the c&apos;omplainant as well as a witness in the case are even
			<lb />
			on date granted police protection. The report makes no reference
			<lb />
			to the circumstances in which the parole was rejected.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			818. It needs no elaboration that it is not the conduct of the
			<lb />
			defendant when consideration of his appeal is underway which
			<lb />
			alone is to be considered but his conduct over his entire stay in jail
			<lb />
			has to be considered.
			<lb />
			We have already noted above the report from the
			<lb />
			Superintendant, Jail about the defendants&apos; conduct since 2013.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			819. Something needs to be stated about this report which has
			<lb />
			been filed directly by the jail authorities without being routed
			<lb />
			through even learned Additional Standing Counsel for the State
			<lb />
			who represents the authorities before us. There is certainly weight
			<lb />
			in the submission of Mr. Dey that this defendant continues to wield
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 554
			<lb />
			a deep influence. We are refraining from commenting further on
			<lb />
			this report which we will consider in the writ petition.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(xvi) Conduct since July, 2013
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			820. Mr. Sumeet Verma, learned counsel appearing for Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav has submitted that Vikas Yadav has undergone several
			<lb />
			Vipasana sessions in the jail. In support of his submission with
			<lb />
			regard to jail conduct of Vikas Yadav is concerned, Mr. Verma has
			<lb />
			pointed out that Vikas Yadav&apos;s conduct in jail for the last one year
			<lb />
			has been exemplary. Placing reliance on certificates and rewards
			<lb />
			by jail authorities including a certificate of recognition dated 16th
			<lb />
			April, 2014; for good conduct; 31st May, 2014 issued by the
			<lb />
			Gandhi Smriti Darshan Samiti for participating in the competition
			<lb />
			and his poetry published in by-monthly jail magazine &quot;Asha Ki
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			821. The above activities and courses have been undergone by
			<lb />
			him after the consideration of the appeal against conviction had
			<lb />
			commenced. Reform, remorse and repentance for the offence as
			<lb />
			well as respect for systems has to be manifested from every action
			<lb />
			of the defendant. Only then will the court conclude that reform and
			<lb />
			rehabilitation is possible. Lip service to the rehabilitation
			<lb />
			programmes being conducted in the jail with the object of earning
			<lb />
			sympathy of the court cannot impact the present consideration. It
			<lb />
			is while in custody, the defendant has manipulated many outside
			<lb />
			jail visits.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			822. However, the nominal rolls also do not disclose any jail
			<lb />
			offences by any of the three defendants over the last year. The
			<lb />
			nominal rolls state that the conduct of the defendants in jail is now
			<lb />
			satisfactory. There is also no material that after 2012, the
			<lb />
			defendants are still manipulating the systems to secure &apos;outings&apos;
			<lb />
			from the jail.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			823. Let us also examine the material available in the present case
			<lb />
			on the aspect of possibility of reform and rehabilitation of these
			<lb />
			defendants. The nominal rolls discussed above would show that
			<lb />
			for the last one year only, the conduct of these defendants has been
			<lb />
			satisfactory. No offence is reported from the jail after July, 2013.
			<lb />
			This fact would suggest that the possibility of reformation and
			<lb />
			rehabilitation of the defendants is not &quot;unforseeably foreclosed&quot;
			<lb />
			and therefore, the present case may not invite the imposition of
			<lb />
			death penalty on the defendants.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(xvii) Variations in judicial response to similar fact situations
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			824. So far as imposition of a death sentence is concerned, it is
			<lb />
			argued before us that one guard who rapes and murders a young
			<lb />
			girl residing in the building over which he stands as a guard got a
			<lb />
			death sentence (Dhananjoy Chatterjee) whereas a similarly aged
			<lb />
			guard who commits a similar, if not identical crime, gets life
			<lb />
			imprisonment (Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod).
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			submission is that use of a particular weapon for commission of the
			<lb />
			crime of murder makes it more heinous in one case while the same
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 556
			<lb />
			may be treated as less heinous in another. It leads to variation in
			<lb />
			the sentence imposed from the capital punishment in one case to
			<lb />
			the life imprisonment in another. Learned counsels submit that the
			<lb />
			education or the economic status of one defendant has been
			<lb />
			considered a mitigating circumstance while considering imposition
			<lb />
			of a punishment. It is urged that on the other hand, higher
			<lb />
			education, better economic status should in fact be an aggravating
			<lb />
			circumstance as such persons would be expected to know both the
			<lb />
			correct conduct as well as the consequences of their actions; why
			<lb />
			should the act of cutting up a dead body after murdering a in one
			<lb />
			case lead to imposition of a death sentence whereas for a similar
			<lb />
			offence, in another case, it may not be deemed relevant. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that this dichotomy ought to weigh in favour of the
			<lb />
			defendants.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			825. We may usefully refer to Sangeet, Rameshbhai
			<lb />
			Chandubhai Rathod (2), Swamy Shraddananda (2) and Ashok
			<lb />
			Debbarma @ Achak Debbarma wherein the court has expressed
			<lb />
			distress and discomfort with imposition of death sentences for
			<lb />
			other reasons.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			826. In Swamy Shraddananda (2), the court reviewed the
			<lb />
			application of the sentencing court relating to the death sentence
			<lb />
			through aggravating and mitigating circumstances and concluded
			<lb />
			that there was lack of evenness in the sentencing process. In para
			<lb />
			48 of the judgment, the court held thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;48. That is not the end of the matter. Coupled with the
			<lb />
			deficiency of the criminal justice system is the lack of
			<lb />
			consistency in the sentencing process even by this
			<lb />
			Court. It is noted above that Bachan Singh [(1980) 2
			<lb />
			SCC 684 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 580 : AIR 1980 SC 898] laid
			<lb />
			down the principle of the rarest of rare cases. Machhi
			<lb />
			Singh [(1983) 3 SCC 470 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 681] , for
			<lb />
			practical application crystallised the principle into five
			<lb />
			definite categories of cases of murder and in doing so
			<lb />
			also considerably enlarged the scope for imposing death
			<lb />
			penalty. But the unfortunate reality is that in later
			<lb />
			decisions neither the rarest of rare cases principle nor
			<lb />
			the Machhi Singh [(1983) 3 SCC 470 : 1983 SCC (Cri)
			<lb />
			681] categories were followed uniformly and
			<lb />
			consistently.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			827. The Supreme Court&apos;s discomfort that the working of the
			<lb />
			balance sheet approach had not worked sufficiently well was
			<lb />
			reiterated in (2009) 6 SCC 498, Santosh Kumar Satish Bhushan
			<lb />
			Bariyar v. State of Maharashtra in the following terms:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;109. xxx xxx xxx the balance sheet of aggravating and
			<lb />
			mitigating circumstances approach invoked on a case-
			<lb />
			by-case basis has not worked sufficiently well so as to
			<lb />
			remove the vice of arbitrariness from our capital
			<lb />
			sentencing system. It can be safely said that the Bachan
			<lb />
			Singh [(1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 580]
			<lb />
			threshold of -the rarest of rare cases‖ has been most
			<lb />
			variedly and inconsistently applied by the various High
			<lb />
			Courts as also this Court.

			<lb />
			12 SCC 230 : (2008) 2 SCC (Cri) 264 : (2006) 13
			<lb />
			Scale 467] Sinha, J. gave some very good
			<lb />
			illustrations from a number of recent decisions in
			<lb />
			which on similar facts this Court took contrary
			<lb />
			views on giving death penalty to the convict (see
			<lb />
			SCC pp. 279-87, paras 151-78: Scale pp. 504-10,
			<lb />
			paras 154-82). He finally observed (SCC para 158)
			<lb />
			that ‗courts in the matter of sentencing act
			<lb />
			differently although the fact situation may appear
			<lb />
			to be somewhat similar&apos; and further ‗it is evident
			<lb />
			that different Benches had taken different view in
			<lb />
			the matter&apos; (SCC para 168). Katju, J. in his order
			<lb />
			passed in this appeal said that he did not agree with
			<lb />
			the decision in Aloke Nath Dutta [(2007) 12 SCC
			<lb />
			230 : (2008) 2 SCC (Cri) 264 : (2006) 13 Scale
			<lb />
			467] in that it held that death sentence was not to
			<lb />
			be awarded in a case of circumstantial evidence.
			<lb />
			Katju, J. may be right that there cannot be an
			<lb />
			absolute rule excluding death sentence in all cases
			<lb />
			of circumstantial evidence (though inAloke Nath
			<lb />
			Dutta [(2007) 12 SCC 230 : (2008) 2 SCC (Cri)
			<lb />
			264 : (2006) 13 Scale 467] it is said ‗normally&apos; and
			<lb />
			not as an absolute rule). But there is no denying
			<lb />
			the illustrations cited by Sinha, J. which are a
			<lb />
			matter of fact.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			50. The same point is made in far greater detail in
			<lb />
			a report called, ‗Lethal Lottery, The Death Penalty
			<lb />
			in India&apos; compiled jointly by Amnesty
			<lb />
			International India and People&apos;s Union for Civil
			<lb />
			Liberties, Tamil Nadu &amp; Puducherry. The report is
			<lb />
			based on the study of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			judgments in death penalty cases from 1950 to
			<lb />
			2006. One of the main points made in the report
			<lb />
			(see Chapters 2 to 4) is about the Court&apos;s lack of
			<lb />
			uniformity and consistency in awarding death
			<lb />
			sentence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			51. The truth of the matter is that the question of
			<lb />
			death penalty is not free from the subjective
			<lb />
			element and the confirmation of death sentence or
			<lb />
			its commutation by this Court depends a good deal
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 559
			<lb />
			on the personal predilection of the Judges
			<lb />
			constituting the Bench.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			52. The inability of the criminal justice system to
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			deal with all major crimes equally effectively and
			<lb />
			the want of uniformity in the sentencing process by
			<lb />
			the Court lead to a marked imbalance in the end
			<lb />
			results. On the one hand there appears a small
			<lb />
			band of cases in which the murder convict is sent
			<lb />
			to the gallows on confirmation of his death penalty
			<lb />
			by this Court and on the other hand there is a
			<lb />
			much wider area of cases in which the offender
			<lb />
			committing murder of a similar or a far more
			<lb />
			revolting kind is spared his life due to lack of
			<lb />
			consistency by the Court in giving punishments
			<lb />
			or worse the offender is allowed to slip away
			<lb />
			unpunished on account of the deficiencies in the
			<lb />
			criminal justice system. Thus the overall larger
			<lb />
			picture gets asymmetric and lopsided and presents
			<lb />
			a poor reflection of the system of criminal
			<lb />
			administration of justice. This situation is a matter
			<lb />
			of concern for this Court and needs to be remedied.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			53. These are some of the larger issues that make
			<lb />
			us feel reluctant in confirming the death sentence
			<lb />
			of the appellant.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			130. Equal protection clause ingrained under Article 14
			<lb />
			applies to the judicial process at the sentencing stage. We
			<lb />
			share the Court&apos;s unease and sense of disquiet
			<lb />
			in Swamy Shraddananda (2) case [(2008) 13 SCC 767 :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(2008) 10 Scale 669] and agree that a capital
			<lb />
			sentencing system which results in differential
			<lb />
			treatment of similarly situated capital convicts
			<lb />
			effectively classifies similar convicts differently with
			<lb />
			respect to their right to life under Article 21. Therefore,
			<lb />
			an equal protection analysis of this problem is
			<lb />
			appropriate. In the ultimate analysis, it serves as an alarm
			<lb />
			bell because if capital sentences cannot be rationally
			<lb />
			distinguished from a significant number of cases where
			<lb />
			the result was a life sentence, it is more than an
			<lb />
			acknowledgement of an imperfect sentencing system. In
			<lb />
			a capital sentencing system if this happens with some
			<lb />
			frequency there is a lurking conclusion as regards the
			<lb />
			capital sentencing system becoming constitutionally
			<lb />
			arbitrary. We have to be, thus, mindful that the true
			<lb />
			import of rarest of rare doctrine speaks of an
			<lb />
			extraordinary and exceptional case.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			828. The above discomfort was noted by the two Judge Bench in
			<lb />
			(2013) 2 SCC 452, Sangeet &amp; Anr. v. State of Haryana in the
			<lb />
			following terms:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;32. It does appear that in view of the inherent multitude
			<lb />
			of possibilities, the aggravating and mitigating
			<lb />
			circumstances approach has not been effectively
			<lb />
			implemented.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			33. Therefore, in our respectful opinion, not only does
			<lb />
			the aggravating and mitigating circumstances approach
			<lb />
			need a fresh look but the necessity of adopting this
			<lb />
			approach also needs a fresh look in light of the
			<lb />
			conclusions in Bachan Singh[(1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980
			<lb />
			SCC (Cri) 580] . It appears to us that even thoughBachan
			<lb />
			Singh [(1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 580] intended
			<lb />
			-principled sentencing‖, sentencing has now really
			<lb />
			become Judge-centric as highlighted inSwamy
			<lb />
			Shraddananda [(2008) 13 SCC 767 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri)
			<lb />
			113] and Bariyar[(2009) 6 SCC 498 : (2009) 2 SCC (Cri)
			<lb />
			1150] . This aspect of the sentencing policy in Phase II as
			<lb />
			introduced by the Constitution Bench in Bachan
			<lb />
			Singh [(1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 580] seems to
			<lb />
			have been lost in transition.

			<lb />
			categorisation of crimes inMachhi Singh [(1983) 3 SCC
			<lb />
			470 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 681] has not received further
			<lb />
			importance from this Court, although it is referred to
			<lb />
			from time to time. This only demonstrates that though
			<lb />
			Phase II in the development of a sound sentencing policy
			<lb />
			is still alive, it is a little unsteady in its application,
			<lb />
			despite Bachan Singh [(1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC
			<lb />
			(Cri) 580].&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			829. Given the uncertainty from the judgecentric sentencing, the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in Sangeet also ruled that the imposition of life
			<lb />
			imprisonment instead of death penalty in such cases was not
			<lb />
			-unquestionably foreclosed‖.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			830. In (2011) 2 SCC 764, Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod (2)
			<lb />
			v. State of Gujarat, the case involved rape and murder of a class IV
			<lb />
			girl child by the appellant who was a watchman in the residential
			<lb />
			complex where she was residing. On account of disagreement
			<lb />
			between the judgment of a two Judge Bench on the question of
			<lb />
			sentence, the matter was placed before three Judge Bench. On
			<lb />
			consideration of the reference, in para 8, the Bench observed as
			<lb />
			follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;8. As already mentioned above, both the Hon&apos;ble
			<lb />
			Judges have relied on a number of cases which are on
			<lb />
			almost identical facts in support of their respective
			<lb />
			points of view. We notice that there is a very thin line
			<lb />
			on facts which separates the award of a capital sentence
			<lb />
			from a life sentence in the case of rape and murder of a
			<lb />
			young child by a young man and the subjective opinion
			<lb />
			of individual Judges as to the morality, efficacy or
			<lb />
			otherwise of a death sentence cannot entirely be ruled
			<lb />
			out. It is now well settled that as on today the broad
			<lb />
			principle is that the death sentence is to be awarded only
			<lb />
			in exceptional cases.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			831. It was noted that the learned judge who had differed and
			<lb />
			awarded life sentence was persuaded to do so inter alia on account
			<lb />
			of there being some uncertainty that the nature of circumstantial
			<lb />
			evidence; mitigating circumstances particularly the young age of
			<lb />
			the appellant; the possibility that he could be rehabilitated and
			<lb />
			would not commit any offence later on could not be ruled out and
			<lb />
			the finding that the statutory obligation cast on the court under
			<lb />
			Section 235(2) read with 354(3) Cr.P.C. had been violated.
			<lb />
			Inasmuch as the accused had not been given adequate opportunity
			<lb />
			to plead on the question of sentence. The larger Bench had agreed
			<lb />
			with these observations and had consequently commuted the death
			<lb />
			sentence awarded to the appellant to life but directed that the life
			<lb />
			sentence must extend to the full life of the appellant but subject to
			<lb />
			any remission or commutation at the instance of the government
			<lb />
			for good and sufficient reasons.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			832. While altering the death sentence to imprisonment for life
			<lb />
			and fixing the term of imprisonment as 20 years without remission
			<lb />
			over and above the period of sentence already undergone, in the
			<lb />
			case reported at (2014) 4 SCC 747 : 2014 (3) SCALE 344, Ashok
			<lb />
			Debbarma v. State of Tripura, Radha Krishnan, J. had noted the
			<lb />
			profound right of the accused not to be convicted of an offence
			<lb />
			which is not established by the evidential standard of proof
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

			&quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;. In para 29, the court discussed
			<lb />
			&apos;residual doubt&apos; as a mitigating circumstance which was sometimes
			<lb />
			used and urged in the United States of America dealing with the
			<lb />
			death sentence. Refering to the fact situation of the case, the
			<lb />
			observations of the court in para 31 deserve to be extracted in
			<lb />
			extenso and read as thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;31. In Commonwealth v. Webster [(1850) 5 Cush 295 :
			<lb />
			52 Am Dec 711 (Mass Sup Ct)] at p. 320, Massachusetts
			<lb />
			Court, as early as in 1850, has explained the expression
			<lb />
			-reasonable doubt‖ as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			-Reasonable doubt … is not a mere possible doubt;
			<lb />
			because everything relating to human affairs, and
			<lb />
			depending on moral evidence, is open to some
			<lb />
			possible or imaginary doubt. It is that state of the
			<lb />
			case which, after the entire comparison and
			<lb />
			consideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds
			<lb />
			of the jurors in that condition that they cannot say
			<lb />
			they feel an abiding conviction.‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			In our criminal justice system, for recording guilt of the
			<lb />
			accused, it is not necessary that the prosecution should
			<lb />
			prove the case with absolute or mathematical certainty,
			<lb />
			but only beyond reasonable doubt. Criminal courts, while
			<lb />
			examining whether any doubt is beyond reasonable
			<lb />
			doubt, may carry in their mind, some -residual doubt‖,
			<lb />
			even though the courts are convinced of the accused
			<lb />
			persons&apos; guilt beyond reasonable doubt. For instance, in
			<lb />
			the instant case, it was pointed out that, according to the
			<lb />
			prosecution, 30-35 persons armed with weapons such as
			<lb />
			firearms, dao, lathi, etc., set fire to the houses of the
			<lb />
			villagers and opened fire which resulted in the death of
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			15 persons, but only eleven persons were charge-sheeted
			<lb />
			and, out of which, charges were framed only against five
			<lb />
			accused persons. Even out of those five persons, three
			<lb />
			were acquitted, leaving the appellant and another, who is
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 564
			<lb />
			absconding. The court, in such circumstances, could have
			<lb />
			entertained a -residual doubt‖ as to whether the appellant
			<lb />
			alone had committed the entire crime, which is a
			<lb />
			mitigating circumstance to be taken note of by the court,
			<lb />
			at least when the court is considering the question
			<lb />
			whether the case falls under the rarest of the rare
			<lb />
			category.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			833. The court also considered the counsel&apos;s ineffectiveness
			<lb />
			which may have prejudiced the defence as a mitigating factor in
			<lb />
			para 36 of the judgment which reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;36. Right to get proper and competent assistance is the
			<lb />
			facet of fair trial. This Court in M.H. Hoskot v. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra [(1978) 3 SCC 544 : 1978 SCC (Cri)
			<lb />
			468], State of Haryana v. Darshana Devi [(1979) 2 SCC
			<lb />
			236], Hussainara Khatoon (4) v. State of Bihar [(1980) 1
			<lb />
			SCC 98 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 40] and Ranjan
			<lb />
			Dwivedi v.Union of India [(1983) 3 SCC 307 : 1983 SCC
			<lb />
			(Cri) 581], pointed out that if the accused is unable to
			<lb />
			engage a counsel, owing to poverty or similar
			<lb />
			circumstances, trial would be vitiated unless the State
			<lb />
			offers free legal aid for his defence to engage a counsel,
			<lb />
			to whose engagement, the accused does not object. It is a
			<lb />
			constitutional guarantee conferred on the accused persons
			<lb />
			under Article 22(1) of the Constitution. Section 304
			<lb />
			CrPC provides for legal assistance to the accused on
			<lb />
			State expenditure. Apart from the statutory provisions
			<lb />
			contained in Article 22(1) and Section 304 CrPC,
			<lb />
			in Hussainara Khatoon (4) case [(1980) 1 SCC 98 : 1980
			<lb />
			SCC (Cri) 40] , this Court has held that: (SCC p. 105,
			<lb />
			para 7)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			-7. … This is a constitutional right of every
			<lb />
			accused person who is unable to engage a lawyer
			<lb />
			and secure legal services on account of reasons
			<lb />
			such as poverty, indigence or incommunicado
			<lb />
			situation….‖
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			834. In para 37, the court noted a submission on behalf of the
			<lb />
			appellant that ineffective legal assistance caused prejudiced to him
			<lb />
			and hence the same be treated as a mitigating circumstance while
			<lb />
			awarding sentence. The Supreme Court noted in para 38 that the
			<lb />
			&quot;right to get proper legal assistance plays a crucial role in
			<lb />
			adversarial system, since excess to counsel&apos;s skill and knowledge is
			<lb />
			necessary to accord the accused an ample opportunity to meet the
			<lb />
			case of the prosecution&quot;.

			835. So far as to whether such ineffectiveness of counsel has to be
			<lb />
			treated as a mitigating circumstance, in para 39, the court held as
			<lb />
			follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;39. The court, in determining whether prejudice
			<lb />
			resulted from a criminal defence counsel&apos;s
			<lb />
			ineffectiveness, must consider the totality of the
			<lb />
			evidence. When an accused challenges a death sentence
			<lb />
			on the ground of prejudicially ineffective representation
			<lb />
			of the counsel, the question is whether there is a
			<lb />
			reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the court
			<lb />
			independently reweighing the evidence, would have
			<lb />
			concluded that the balance of aggravating and
			<lb />
			mitigating circumstances did not warrant the death
			<lb />
			sentence.
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Thus the Supreme Court has considered residual doubt
			<lb />
			nurtured by the court and counsel&apos;s ineffectiveness as relevant
			<lb />
			circumstances for not awarding the death sentence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			836. Yet another factor which is unique to the imposition of the
			<lb />
			death penalty is that, once executed, a death sentence is irreversible
			<lb />
			in nature. Once the life of the convict is extinguished, he cannot be
			<lb />
			brought back. The discussion in the preceding paras of this
			<lb />
			judgment would show that even judicially trained minds can apply
			<lb />
			the same circumstance as aggravating or mitigating differently to
			<lb />
			conclude that the circumstances do not warrant a death penalty
			<lb />
			whereas another may feel it to be a fit case justifying the death
			<lb />
			penalty.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			837. The Supreme Court was called upon to consider the question
			<lb />
			as to whether the hearing of review petitions by the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			in death sentence cases should not be by circulation but should be
			<lb />
			in open court only. The anxiety of the Constitution Bench of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court to ensure that no injustice results, was emphasised
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			judgment
			<lb />
			dated
			<lb />
			2 nd
			<lb />
			September,
			<lb />
			2014
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			W.P.(Crl.)No.77/2014, Mohd. Arif @ Ashfaq v. The Registrar,
			<lb />
			Supreme Court of India &amp; Ors., when it was held that -even a
			<lb />
			remote chance of deviating from such a decision while exercising
			<lb />
			the review jurisdiction, would justify oral hearing in a review
			<lb />
			petition&quot;. The Supreme Court emphasised the fact that &quot;when on
			<lb />
			the same set of facts, one judicial mind can come to the conclusion
			<lb />
			that the circumstances do not warrant a death penalty, whereas
			<lb />
			another may feel it to be a fit case fully justifying the death penalty,
			<lb />
			we feel that when a convict who has suffered the sentence of death
			<lb />
			and files a review petition, the necessity of oral hearing in such a
			<lb />
			review petition becomes an integral part of &quot;reasonable
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 567
			<lb />
			procedure&quot;.&quot; It is keeping in view the above two realities which
			<lb />
			impact the fundamental right to life under Article 21 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution of India of a person, it has been held in Mohd. Arif
			<lb />
			that to be just fair and reasonable, any procedure impacting the
			<lb />
			right, has to take into account these two factors.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			838. For this reason, keeping in view the rights of the convict
			<lb />
			under Article 21; irreversibility of the death sentence and the
			<lb />
			possibility of any Judge on the Bench taking a different view,
			<lb />
			persuaded the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court to grant an
			<lb />
			open court hearing in a death sentence review petition in Mohd.
			<lb />
			Arif.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			839. An intercaste marriage of a person of general caste perceived
			<lb />
			to be belonging to a scheduled caste as a husband resulted in the
			<lb />
			murder of five members of the bride by the appellants who
			<lb />
			belonged to his caste in the judgment reported at (1987) 3 SCC 80,
			<lb />
			Mahesh v. State of M.P. The High Court confirmed the sentence
			<lb />
			of death imposed on the two appellants observing that the act of the
			<lb />
			appellant -was extremely brutal, revolting and gruesome which
			<lb />
			shocks the judicial conscience‖. It was further observed that -in
			<lb />
			such shocking nature of crime as the one before us which is so
			<lb />
			cruel, barbaric and revolting, it is necessary to impose such
			<lb />
			maximum punishment under the law as a measure of social
			<lb />
			necessity which work as a deterrent to other potential offenders‖.
			<lb />
			The Supreme Court shared the concern of the High Court
			<lb />
			and observed that it would be a mockery of justice to permit the
			<lb />
			appellants to escape the extreme penalty of law when faced with
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 568
			<lb />
			such offence and such cruel acts. The death sentence was
			<lb />
			accordingly confirmed.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			840. Another precedent in which the motive of murder was the
			<lb />
			intercaste marriage of the sister of one of the appellant despite
			<lb />
			resentment and disapproval by the girl&apos;s family, has been brought
			<lb />
			to our notice. The judgment of the Supreme Court is reported at
			<lb />
			(2010) 1 SCC 775, Dilip Premnarayan Tiwari v. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra. The appellant stood convicted of the offence of
			<lb />
			murder and sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			841. This very factor that on the same, that on very similar facts,
			<lb />
			variable sentences are possible also dissuades us from invoking our
			<lb />
			jurisdiction in imposing the death sentence in the present case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			XX. If not death penalty, what would be an adequate sentence
			<lb />
			in the present case?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			842. In the present case, the manner in which the offence was
			<lb />
			committed; the impunity with which effort was made to remove
			<lb />
			traces of the offence by removing clothes, jewellery, phone, etc.
			<lb />
			and burning the body; the abscondance after the commission of the
			<lb />
			offence and the stage managing of the arrest; the conduct of the
			<lb />
			defendants during investigation and after conviction, especially,
			<lb />
			misuse and abuse of the facility of outside hospital visits and
			<lb />
			hospitalisation despite the passage of a decade after the offence,
			<lb />
			establishes the fact the that the long incarceration has had little
			<lb />
			impact on the defendants who have neither remorse nor repentance
			<lb />
			for their actions. With impunity, Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 569
			<lb />
			even in jail believe that they can manipulate all systems. These
			<lb />
			two defendants have displayed that they have no respect for the
			<lb />
			criminal dispensation system nor any fear of the law.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			843. So far as the present order is concerned, it is not disputed
			<lb />
			before us that substance has been found in the apprehensions
			<lb />
			expressed by Nilam Katara (mother of the deceased) and Ajay
			<lb />
			Katara and they have been afforded police protection which
			<lb />
			continued even on date, more than twelve years after the crime.
			<lb />
			Would this not be a material fact while evaluating a just and
			<lb />
			appropriate sentence to the convict? It is certainly material as well
			<lb />
			as relevant fact. [Ref. : 2009 VIII AD (Delhi) 262, State v. Shree
			<lb />
			Gopal @ Mani Gopal (para 35)]
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			844. From paras 1925 to 1927 in the judgment dated 2nd April,
			<lb />
			2014, we have noted the traumatisation and the pressure put on
			<lb />
			Ajay Katara to prevent him from deposing in the present case.
			<lb />
			Prior to the case in hand, Ajay Katara seems to have been living an
			<lb />
			ordinary existence. The only litigation he seemed to be embroiled
			<lb />
			in was with his wife with regard to their matrimonial ties. Post the
			<lb />
			murder of Nitish Katara and his deposition as a witness in the case,
			<lb />
			he is facing multiple cases at the instance of relatives of the
			<lb />
			defendant, Ajay Katara. It would seem as if deposition in a case
			<lb />
			has suddenly transformed a person from somebody of ordinary
			<lb />
			sensibilities and temperament into a habitual criminal.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			845. The absolute propositions pressed by the defendants,
			<lb />
			emphasising individual circumstance and as held thereon by the
			<lb />
			learned trial judges are clearly untenable. This is to be found from
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 570
			<lb />
			a reading of the principles culled out in Mofil Khan above. Each
			<lb />
			circumstance cannot be treated as by itself enabling the court to
			<lb />
			arrive at a conclusion as to what would be a punishment adequate
			<lb />
			for and befitting the crime. The reference to the balance sheet by
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court was never of the nature of &apos;one plus one would
			<lb />
			necessarily make two&apos; but required a consideration of the varied
			<lb />
			facts and circumstances which lead to and go into a crime
			<lb />
			cumulatively, especially heinous crimes.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			846. In this background, the consideration by the learned trial
			<lb />
			judges of each of the established circumstances individually
			<lb />
			without examining the same cumulatively or in totality is clearly
			<lb />
			contrary to the well settled principles of law on which sentencing is
			<lb />
			to be effected. The learned trial judges have completely failed to
			<lb />
			consider material circumstances including the pre-meditation
			<lb />
			which went into the offence as well as manner of its execution;
			<lb />
			antecedents of the defendants; the impact of the crime on society;
			<lb />
			the conduct of the defendants; amongst others, which have been
			<lb />
			held by the Supreme Court to be an aggravating circumstance and
			<lb />
			an essential consideration for imposing an appropriate sentence.
			<lb />
			The assessment of the mitigating and aggravating circumstances by
			<lb />
			the trial courts was therefore, incomplete and cannot be the basis
			<lb />
			for evaluation of an adequate sentence on the defendants.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			847. Mr. Rajesh Mahajan has pressed that there are several
			<lb />
			precedents wherein, on a consideration of the relevant factors, the
			<lb />
			court held that the possibility of reformation and rehabilitation is
			<lb />
			not ruled out and therefore, death penalty was not imposed.
			<lb />
			However, instead of awarding life sentences simplicitor, term
			<lb />
			sentences or consecutive running sentences were imposed upon the
			<lb />
			convicts. In this regard, reference is made to the pronouncements
			<lb />
			in (2012) 4 SCC 257, Ramnaresh v. State of Chhattisgarh (21
			<lb />
			years sentence); (2002) 2 SCC 35, Prakash Dhawal Khairnar
			<lb />
			(Patil) v. State of Maharashtra (20 years sentence); 2014 (8)
			<lb />
			SCALE 113, Amar Singh Yadav v. State of U.P. (30 years
			<lb />
			sentence) and; (2013) 2 SCC 479, Sandesh @ Sainath Kailash
			<lb />
			Abhang v. State of Maharashtra (consecutive running of
			<lb />
			sentences). It is submitted that if this court is not inclined to
			<lb />
			impose the death penalty, certainly life sentence simplicitor is not
			<lb />
			an adequate sentence and the court must consider this other option.
			<lb />
			We shall examine this submission hereafter.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			848. The learned trial judges have imposed a sentence of life
			<lb />
			imprisonment on the three convicts for commission of the offence
			<lb />
			under Section 302 of the IPC without any more. The defendants
			<lb />
			could therefore, make an application in accordance with the
			<lb />
			provisions of Sections 431 to 433A of the Cr.P.C. for remission of
			<lb />
			the sentence imposed on them upon completion of 14 years of
			<lb />
			imprisonment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			849. The learned trial judges by the order dated 30th May, 2002
			<lb />
			against Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav and by the order dated 12th
			<lb />
			July, 2011 against Sukhdev Yadav, have imposed the following
			<lb />
			sentences upon them:

			<lb />
		</table>
		<p>
			850. A most distressing aspect of the murder of Nitish Katara is
			<lb />
			the fact that the convicts made a conscious choice to opt as to
			<lb />
			which one, out of the two partners in the objected relationship, they
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 573
			<lb />
			would eliminate. They consciously decided to sacrifice Nitish
			<lb />
			Katara while sparing the life of Bharti Yadav perceived as their
			<lb />
			own.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			851. The crimes were perpetrated in an organized and systematic
			<lb />
			manner. The amplitude of the gravity of the offence, its nature and
			<lb />
			its deleterious effect, not only upon the victim or his family but
			<lb />
			upon the entire civilized society at large, cries for the need that the
			<lb />
			defendants be adequately punished. It is sentence of life
			<lb />
			imprisonment simplicitor were to be remitted or commuted on
			<lb />
			expiry of 14 years in terms of the CrPC provisions, the sentence
			<lb />
			would really be inconsequential and completely inadequate so far
			<lb />
			as the crimes in the instant case is concerned.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			852. The abduction of the deceased was integral to the offence of
			<lb />
			murder. The detailed discussion in our judgment dated 2 nd April,
			<lb />
			2014 would show that the abduction was really an aggravating
			<lb />
			feature of the murder, firstly because of the level of planning which
			<lb />
			has gone into it and secondly, its meticulous execution. Thirdly,
			<lb />
			the degree of arrogance displayed by the defendants who took
			<lb />
			away the victim from amidst hundreds of guests. As we have
			<lb />
			considered abduction as integral, to the offence of murder, we are
			<lb />
			of the view that the sentences of imprisonment on these two
			<lb />
			offences can run concurrently.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			853. The offence involving burning of the body in order to cover
			<lb />
			the acts of the defendants was also brutal, cruel and heartless. It
			<lb />
			left an indelible negative impact on the family and horrified the
			<lb />
			society. This act of burning was committed as part of the same
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 574
			<lb />
			premeditation but it was committed after the commission of the
			<lb />
			offence of murder. This therefore, justifies a consecutive sentence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			854. After the brutal crime was committed, the clarity of the
			<lb />
			defendants is evident in the care that they took in removing all
			<lb />
			articles of identification from his body; concealing his clothes,
			<lb />
			mobile, gold chain as well as the hammer which was the weapon of
			<lb />
			the offence. The defendants thereafter with utmost clarity
			<lb />
			proceeded to the next stage when they absconded from the scene of
			<lb />
			the crime and could not be traced by the police. The brutal murder
			<lb />
			of young Nitish Katara had no impact on the emotions of the three
			<lb />
			defendants who executed the crimes with precision and clarity.
			<lb />
			The depravity in the mindset and planning of the crimes, brutality
			<lb />
			in its execution, post crime conduct during investigation and trial
			<lb />
			detailed above point to one essential fact that a life sentence which
			<lb />
			means only 14 years of imprisonment is grossly inadequate in the
			<lb />
			present cases and that these defendants do not deserve to remission
			<lb />
			of the life sentence imposed on them by application of Section
			<lb />
			433A of the CrPC.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			855. Even the conviction for such heinous offences and their
			<lb />
			incarceration had no impact on two of the defendants. We have
			<lb />
			also noted the conduct of the two defendants Vikas Yadav and
			<lb />
			Vishal Yadav in jail in their unwarranted hospital visits and
			<lb />
			admissions clearly manifesting their basic temperament and the
			<lb />
			sense that they are above the law and all institutions which points
			<lb />
			at difficulty in their reformation or rehabilitation, pointing also to
			<lb />
			the imperative need for a longer stay in jail.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			856. The nominal rolls from the jail have shown that only since
			<lb />
			2013, all the defendants have been careful and their conduct in jail
			<lb />
			has been satisfactory. This only suggests that the possibility of
			<lb />
			their reformation and rehabilitation cannot be ruled out. In fact,
			<lb />
			this factor has weighed with us while rejecting the prayer for
			<lb />
			enhancement of the sentence to imposition of the death penalty
			<lb />
			upon the defendants. There is nothing to show that the defendants
			<lb />
			stand reformed. This conduct supports the view that these
			<lb />
			defendants do not deserve to be set at liberty on completion of the
			<lb />
			14 years of imprisonment mandated under Section 433A of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. and that remission of the sentence at that stage would be
			<lb />
			complete travesty of justice.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			857. There is another very important aspect of the present case. It
			<lb />
			has been urged by Mr. P.K. Dey that there is grave and imminent
			<lb />
			threat to the life of the complainant Nilam Katara and also Ajay
			<lb />
			Katara, the witness on behalf of the prosecution at the hands of the
			<lb />
			defendants who are powerful and wielded influence. For this
			<lb />
			reason, they have been granted police protection even on date. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that if not awarded death sentence, the defendants were
			<lb />
			likely to eliminate the remaining family members of the deceased
			<lb />
			Nilam Katara as is evident from their conduct and behaviour. As
			<lb />
			noted in our judgment of 2nd April, 2014, these apprehensions are
			<lb />
			not without substance.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			858. A similar contention was argued on behalf of the prosecution
			<lb />
			witness in the judgment reported at (2001) 4 SCC 458, Subhash
			<lb />
			Chandra v. Krishan Lal. The court had taken on record the
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 576
			<lb />
			statement made by one of the convicts to the effect that
			<lb />
			imprisonment for life shall be the imprisonment in prison for the
			<lb />
			rest of life. Keeping in view the circumstances of the case
			<lb />
			specially the apprehension of the imminent danger expressed by
			<lb />
			the witness, the court ordered that for this appellant, imprisonment
			<lb />
			for life shall be the imprisonment in prison for the rest of his life,
			<lb />
			that he shall not be entitled to any commutation or premature
			<lb />
			release under the Cr.P.C., Prisoners Act, Jail Manual or any other
			<lb />
			statute and rules made for the purposes of grant of commutation
			<lb />
			and remissions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			859. It is therefore, manifest that the concerns, safety and security
			<lb />
			of witnesses remain an abiding concern for imposing a sentence as
			<lb />
			well as at the stage of consideration of a prayer for remission of the
			<lb />
			sentence under Section 432 of the Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			860. These aggravating aspects become relevant when setting the
			<lb />
			period of imprisonment should be required to serve before
			<lb />
			remission should be considered. It would also be permissible and
			<lb />
			fair to impose a consecutive sentence whereupon a sentence for
			<lb />
			commission of one offence would commence on completion of the
			<lb />
			sentence of imprisonment for another offence or upon remission of
			<lb />
			the sentence to these persons was being examined and granted.
			<lb />
			Therefore, looked at from any angle, certainly a prolonged
			<lb />
			stay in a controlled environment as the prison with its discipline
			<lb />
			and community activities, especially those relating to the mind, is
			<lb />
			essential to ensure the reformation of the two defendants, namely,
			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav.
			<lb />

			861. After his arrest, Sukhdev Yadav appears to have been
			<lb />
			chastened. We may note that there is a jail offence attributed to
			<lb />
			him on 10th of July, 2013 with regard to assaulting to a ward
			<lb />
			sahayak for which he was awarded punishment. Interstingly, an
			<lb />
			identical offence dated 10th July, 2013 is attributed to Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
			for which he has also been awarded punishment. We do not know
			<lb />
			whether the two were implicated in the same offence. If the two
			<lb />
			were implicated for the same crime, it has to be borne in mind that
			<lb />
			Sukhdev Yadav was an employee of the father of Vikas Yadav
			<lb />
			which may have been the influence for his involvement in this jail
			<lb />
			offence. However, there is no allegation with regard to violating
			<lb />
			any other jail regulation against Sukhdev Yadav. Another
			<lb />
			important circumstance is the fact that only the State has sought
			<lb />
			enhancement of the sentence imposed on Sukhdev Yadav whereas
			<lb />
			the complainant Nilam Katara in Crl.Rev.No.369/2008, has not
			<lb />
			prayed for enhancement of the sentence against him. In the oral
			<lb />
			submissions, it has been pleaded on behalf of Sukhdev Yadav that
			<lb />
			on account of his incarceration, his family is in dire straits.
			<lb />
			Sukhdev Yadav is a married man with five children. Our inquiry
			<lb />
			has also established that he is not a person of substantial means.
			<lb />
			Keeping only these circumstances in mind, so far as Sukhdev
			<lb />
			Yadav is concerned, we are drawing a distinction between the
			<lb />
			punishments being imposed on Vikas and Vishal Yadav on the one
			<lb />
			hand and Sukhdev Yadav on the other.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			862. We also find that given his lesser paying capacity, the
			<lb />
			default imprisonment which the learned trial judge has ordered for
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 578
			<lb />
			non-payment of fines against Sukhdev Yadav in the judgment
			<lb />
			dated 12 th July, 2011 as unduly harsh. By the present order, we
			<lb />
			propose to modify and reduce the default imprisonments which
			<lb />
			have been imposed on Sukhdev Yadav.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			XXI. Appropriate government for the purposes of Section 432 of
			<lb />
			the Cr.P.C. in the present case
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			863. The instant case arose out of an offence committed in the
			<lb />
			State of U.P. on a complaint which was lodged with the police
			<lb />
			station Kavi Nagar and was registered as FIR No.192/02. The
			<lb />
			chargesheet was originally filed in the district courts at Ghaziabad
			<lb />
			in the State of U.P. A transfer petition being Transfer Petition
			<lb />
			No.449/2002 was filed by Smt. Nilam Katara praying for transfer
			<lb />
			of the case to Delhi. By virtue of orders dated 22 nd May, 2002 and
			<lb />
			22 nd August, 2002 passed by the Supreme Court of India, the trial
			<lb />
			was transferred to the district courts in Delhi and culminated in the
			<lb />
			judgment on conviction dated 28 th May, 2008 so far as Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav and Vishal Yadav are concerned and against Sukhdev
			<lb />
			Yadav on 6 th July, 2011. They were respectively sentenced by the
			<lb />
			judgment dated 30 th May, 2008 and 12 th July, 2011 by the Sessions
			<lb />
			Courts at Delhi.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			864. Section 432 of the Cr.P.C. concerned with the power of
			<lb />
			suspension of the execution of the sentence or remission of the
			<lb />
			whole or any part of the punishment to which he was sentenced,
			<lb />
			envisages an application by a person who has been sentenced to
			<lb />
			punishment for an offence to the &quot;appropriate government&quot;. The
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 579
			<lb />
			expression &quot;appropriate government&quot; is defined under sub-section
			<lb />
			7 of Section 432. For the purposes of the present case, the
			<lb />
			definition of appropriate government in sub-clause (b) of sub-
			<lb />
			section 7 of Section 432 is relevant which defines the &quot;appropriate
			<lb />
			government&quot; as the government of the State within which the
			<lb />
			offender is sentenced.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			865. The Code of Criminal Procedure has conferred the power
			<lb />
			upon the executive to remit the sentence of the defendants in
			<lb />
			Chapter XXXVII of the CrPC. The present case has thrown up a
			<lb />
			unique situation where an offence committed in District Ghaziabad
			<lb />
			in the State of Uttar Pradesh has been tried by the trial court at
			<lb />
			Delhi. The question arises is as to which would be the appropriate
			<lb />
			authority for considering a prayer for remittance of sentence if
			<lb />
			made by the defendants?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			866. In the present case, after their conviction and sentence, it
			<lb />
			appears that Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav filed an appeal
			<lb />
			assailing the same in the High Court of Allahabad which was
			<lb />
			rejected for want of jurisdiction. Though the orders of the
			<lb />
			Allahabad High Court have not been placed before us, but during
			<lb />
			the course of arguments, it was submitted that they assailed the
			<lb />
			order of the Allahabad High Court before the Supreme Court of
			<lb />
			India which rejected the challenge.
			<lb />
			The appeals were thereafter filed before this court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			867. We find that the statute is clear and suggests no ambiguity.
			<lb />
			The defendants have been tried, convicted and sentenced by the
			<lb />
			trial courts at Delhi. The appeals have been heard by the Delhi
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 580
			<lb />
			High Court and the sentences are being considered as well by the
			<lb />
			same court. Therefore, so far as the present defendants are
			<lb />
			concerned, if at any point of time, they were to seek remission of
			<lb />
			the sentence, the only government which is competent to consider
			<lb />
			an application by these defendants under Chapter XXXII (E) of the
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. would be the government of the National Capital Territory
			<lb />
			of Delhi.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			XXII. What ought to be the fines in the present case
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			868. Apart from imprisonment, we note that Section 302 of the
			<lb />
			IPC directs that whoever commits murder shall be punished with
			<lb />
			death or imprisonment for life and shall also be liable for fine.
			<lb />
			Under Section 364, punishment of imprisonment for life or
			<lb />
			rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and fine is prescribed. Under
			<lb />
			Section 201, imprisonment for seven years and fine is prescribed.
			<lb />
			Therefore, while considering an appropriate sentence, apart
			<lb />
			from imprisonment, we also have to consider and direct payment of
			<lb />
			adequate fines.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			869. What would be an appropriate sentence so far as imposition
			<lb />
			of the fine is concerned? Valuable light is thrown on the
			<lb />
			importance of an appropriate sentence befitting the crime in the
			<lb />
			pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (2012) 8 SCC
			<lb />
			450, State v. Sanjeev Nanda. The respondent was involved in a
			<lb />
			motor accident on the night intervening 9 th /10 th January, 1999
			<lb />
			while driving the BMW Car No.M-312-LYP in which he struck
			<lb />
			seven persons standing on the road. The respondent ignored the
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 581
			<lb />
			cries of the injured persons and drove away at a high speed. In this
			<lb />
			accident six persons were killed while PW-2 was injured. Efforts
			<lb />
			were thereafter made to destroy material evidence. The respondent
			<lb />
			was charged under Sections 201, 304 Part I, 308 read with Section
			<lb />
			34 of the IPC. The trial court found the respondent guilty of
			<lb />
			commission of offence under Section 304 Part II IPC and awarded
			<lb />
			him jail sentence of five years while he was acquitted of the other
			<lb />
			charges. His co-accused was found guilty for the commission of
			<lb />
			other offences and also sentenced.
			<lb />
			On appeal to the High Court, the learned Single Judge
			<lb />
			modified the conviction and found the respondent guilty of
			<lb />
			commission of offence under Section 304A IPC and reduced the
			<lb />
			imprisonment sentence to two years.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			870. The Supreme Court was called upon to consider as to
			<lb />
			whether the respondent -convict deserves to be held guilty of
			<lb />
			commission of an offence under Section 304 Part II of the Indian
			<lb />
			Penal Code, 1860 or whether the conviction and sentence awarded
			<lb />
			to him by the High Court of Delhi under Section 304A IPC should
			<lb />
			be held legally tenable. The matter was placed before a two Judge
			<lb />
			Bench of the Supreme Court. The observations of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in the supplementing reasons by Justice K.S.V.
			<lb />
			Radhakrishnan on the consideration of the relevant circumstances
			<lb />
			to arrive at a punishment commensurate with the gravity of the
			<lb />
			offence are illuminating for the present purposes and read thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;115. We may now examine the mitigating and
			<lb />
			aggravating circumstances and decide as to whether the
			<lb />
			punishment awarded by the High Court is commensurate
			<lb />
			with the gravity of the offence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			116. The mitigating circumstances suggested by the
			<lb />
			defence counsel are as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(i) The accused was only 21 years on the date of the
			<lb />
			accident, later married and has a daughter;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) Prolonged trial and judicial unfairness caused
			<lb />
			prejudice;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii) The accused has undergone sentence of two years
			<lb />
			awarded by the High Court and, during that period, his
			<lb />
			conduct and behaviour in the jail was appreciated;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iv) Accident occurred on a foggy day in the early hours
			<lb />
			of morning with poor visibility;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(v) The accused had no previous criminal record nor has
			<lb />
			he been involved in any criminal case subsequently;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(vi) The accused and the family members contributed and
			<lb />
			paid a compensation of Rs 65 lakhs, in total, in the year
			<lb />
			1999 to the families of the victims;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(vii) The accused had neither the intention nor
			<lb />
			knowledge of the ultimate consequences of his action
			<lb />
			and that he was holding a driving licence from the United
			<lb />
			States.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			117. Following are, in our view, the aggravating
			<lb />
			circumstances unfolded in this case:
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(i) Six persons died due to the rash and negligent driving
			<lb />
			of the accused and the car was driven with the knowledge
			<lb />
			that drunken driving without licence is likely to cause
			<lb />
			death.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(ii) Much of the delay in completing the trial could have
			<lb />
			been avoided if wisdom had dawned on the accused
			<lb />
			earlier. Only at the appellate stage the accused had
			<lb />
			admitted that it was he who was driving the vehicle on
			<lb />
			the fateful day which resulted in the death of six
			<lb />
			persons and delay in completion of the trial cannot be
			<lb />
			attributed to the prosecution as the prosecution was
			<lb />
			burdened with the task of establishing the offence
			<lb />
			beyond reasonable doubt by examining sixty-one
			<lb />
			witnesses and producing several documents including
			<lb />
			expert evidence.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iii) The accused did not stop the vehicle in spite of the
			<lb />
			fact that the vehicle had hit six persons and one got
			<lb />
			injured and escaped from the spot without giving any
			<lb />
			helping hand to the victims who were dying and crying
			<lb />
			for help. Human lives could have been saved, if the
			<lb />
			accused had shown some mercy.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(iv) The accused had the knowledge that the car driven
			<lb />
			by him had hit the human beings and human bodies were
			<lb />
			scattered around and they might die, but he thought of
			<lb />
			only his safety and left the place, leaving their fate to
			<lb />
			destiny which, in our view, is not a normal human
			<lb />
			psychology and no court can give a stamp of approval to
			<lb />
			that conduct.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(v) Non-reporting the crime to the police even after
			<lb />
			reaching home and failure to take any steps to provide
			<lb />
			medical help even after escaping from the site.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			118. Payment of compensation to the victims or their
			<lb />
			relatives is not a mitigating circumstance, on the other
			<lb />
			hand, it is a statutory obligation. Age of 21, as such is
			<lb />
			also not a mitigating factor, in the facts of this case,
			<lb />
			since the accused is not an illiterate, poor, rustic
			<lb />
			villager but an educated urban elite, undergoing studies
			<lb />
			abroad. We have to weigh all these mitigating and
			<lb />
			aggravating circumstances while awarding the sentence.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			871. So far as considerations which must weigh with the court
			<lb />
			while passing a sentencing order is concerned, the observations in
			<lb />
			paras 119 to 122 and the directions in para 123 deserve to be
			<lb />
			considered in extenso and read thus:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			-Sentencing
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			119. We have to decide, after having found on facts, that
			<lb />
			this case would fall under Section 304 Part II, what will
			<lb />
			be the appropriate sentence. Generally, the policy which
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 584
			<lb />
			the court adopts while awarding sentence is that the
			<lb />
			punishment must be appropriate and proportional to the
			<lb />
			gravity of the offence committed. Law demands that the
			<lb />
			offender should be adequately punished for the crime, so
			<lb />
			that it can deter the offender and other persons from
			<lb />
			committing similar offences. Nature and circumstances
			<lb />
			of the offence; the need for the sentence imposed to
			<lb />
			reflect the seriousness of the offence; to afford adequate
			<lb />
			deterrence to the conduct and to protect the public from
			<lb />
			such crimes are certain factors to be considered while
			<lb />
			imposing the sentence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			120. The imposition of sentence without considering its
			<lb />
			effect on the social order in many cases is in reality a
			<lb />
			futile exercise. In our view, had the accused extended a
			<lb />
			helping hand to the victims of the accident, caused by
			<lb />
			him by making arrangements to give immediate medical
			<lb />
			attention, perhaps lives of some of the victims could have
			<lb />
			been saved. Even after committing the accident, he only
			<lb />
			thought of his safety, did not care for the victims and
			<lb />
			escaped from the site showing least concern to the human
			<lb />
			beings lying on the road with serious injuries. Conduct of
			<lb />
			the accused is highly reprehensible and cannot be
			<lb />
			countenanced by any court of law.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			121. The High Court, in our view, has committed an error
			<lb />
			in converting the conviction to Section 304-A IPC from
			<lb />
			that of Section 304 Part II IPC and the conviction
			<lb />
			awarded calls for a relook on the basis of the facts
			<lb />
			already discussed, otherwise this Court will be setting a
			<lb />
			bad precedent and sending a wrong message to the
			<lb />
			public. After having found that the offence would fall
			<lb />
			under Section 304 Part II IPC, not under Section 304-A,
			<lb />
			the following sentence awarded would meet the ends of
			<lb />
			justice, in addition to the sentence already awarded by
			<lb />
			the High Court.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Community service for avoiding jail sentence
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			122. Convicts in various countries, now, voluntarily
			<lb />
			come forward to serve the community, especially in
			<lb />
			crimes relating to motor vehicles. Graver the crime,
			<lb />
			greater the sentence. But, serving the society actually is
			<lb />
			not a punishment in the real sense where the convicts pay
			<lb />
			back to the community what they owe. Conduct of the
			<lb />
			convicts will not only be appreciated by the community,
			<lb />
			it will also give a lot of solace to them, especially in a
			<lb />
			case where because of one&apos;s action and inaction, human
			<lb />
			lives have been lost.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			123. In the facts and circumstances of the case, where six
			<lb />
			human lives were lost, we feel, to adopt this method
			<lb />
			would be good for the society rather than incarcerating
			<lb />
			the convict further in jail. Further sentence of fine also
			<lb />
			would compensate at least some of the victims of such
			<lb />
			road accidents who have died, especially in hit-and-run
			<lb />
			cases where the owner or driver cannot be traced. We,
			<lb />
			therefore, order as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(1) The accused has to pay an amount of Rs 50 lakhs
			<lb />
			(Rupees fifty lakhs) to the Union of India within six
			<lb />
			months, which will be utilised for providing
			<lb />
			compensation to the victims of motor accidents, where
			<lb />
			the vehicle owner, driver, etc. could not be traced, like
			<lb />
			victims of hit-and-run cases. On default, he will have to
			<lb />
			undergo simple imprisonment for one year. This amount
			<lb />
			be kept under a different head to be used for the aforesaid
			<lb />
			purpose only.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2) The accused would do community service for two
			<lb />
			years which will be arranged by the Ministry of Social
			<lb />
			Justice and Empowerment within two months. On
			<lb />
			default, he will have to undergo simple imprisonment for
			<lb />
			two years.‖
			<lb />
			(Emphasis by us)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			872. Although, the Supreme Court has not specifically mentioned
			<lb />
			Section 357(1)(a) of the Cr.P.C. while directing the payment of
			<lb />
			Rs.50,00,000/-but it appears that the Supreme Court had exercised
			<lb />
			the jurisdiction under Section 357 while issuing the direction to the
			<lb />
			convict to pay. The relevant para of the judgment is as follows:
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012
			<lb />
			pg. 586
			<lb />
			&quot;127. In addition, the accused is put to the following
			<lb />
			terms:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(1) The accused has to pay an amount of Rs 50 lakhs
			<lb />
			(Rupees fifty lakhs) to the Union of India within six
			<lb />
			months, which will be utilised for providing
			<lb />
			compensation to the victims of motor accidents, where
			<lb />
			the vehicle owner, driver, etc. could not be traced, like
			<lb />
			victims of hit-and-run cases. On default, he will have to
			<lb />
			undergo simple imprisonment for one year. This amount
			<lb />
			be kept under a different head to be used for the aforesaid
			<lb />
			purpose only.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(2) The accused would do community service for two
			<lb />
			years which will be arranged by the Ministry of Social
			<lb />
			Justice and Empowerment within two months. On
			<lb />
			default, he will have to undergo simple imprisonment for
			<lb />
			two years.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			873. In Sanjeev Nanda, the Supreme Court ordered the driver to
			<lb />
			do community service and imposed the sentence of fine payable to
			<lb />
			the Union of India to be utilised for providing compensation to
			<lb />
			victims of motor accidents where vehicle owners, drivers, etc.
			<lb />
			could not be traced, as for instance in hit and run cases in order to
			<lb />
			do complete justice in the case. The High Courts may be able to
			<lb />
			source the power to pass similar order to the inherent powers under
			<lb />
			Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. We are not undertaking an examination
			<lb />
			of the issue as to whether the trial courts have the jurisdiction to so
			<lb />
			mould sentencing orders.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			874. It is well settled that a fine should not be excessive. This
			<lb />
			could obviously relate to the ability to pay the fine by the
			<lb />
			defendant. A fine which cannot be realised would be unduly
			<lb />
			excessive. The quantification has to be effected having regard to
			<lb />
			all the circumstances of the case which include the means of the
			<lb />
			offender [Ref. : AIR 1977 SC 1323, Paliappa Gounder v. State of
			<lb />
			Tamil Nadu (paras 11 and 12)]
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			875. So far as the paying capacity of the defendants is concerned,
			<lb />
			the inquiry has concluded the paying capacity of the defendant
			<lb />
			Vikas Yadav as between Rs.5.50 crores to Rs.5.75 crores and the
			<lb />
			paying capacity of Vishal Yadav at Rs.9.19 crores. So far as
			<lb />
			Sukhdev Yadav is concerned, the inquiry conducted under orders
			<lb />
			of this court has concluded that he does not have financial means to
			<lb />
			pay any substantial compensation to the family of the deceased.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			876. It appears that Vishal Yadav filed an affidavit dated 26th
			<lb />
			May, 2014 before the enquiry officer Shri S.S. Rathi, OSD, Delhi
			<lb />
			Legal Services Authority wherein, so far as immovable properties
			<lb />
			were concerned, Vishal Yadav has stated that he has shares in
			<lb />
			ancestral undivided properties and as per oral understanding, his
			<lb />
			share is 1/3rd of the total value. Based thereon, the learned enquiry
			<lb />
			officer has given the finding with regard to Vishal Yadav&apos;s paying
			<lb />
			capacity. However, in the written submissions dated 17th July,
			<lb />
			2014 filed before us, it is stated on behalf of Vishal Yadav that
			<lb />
			there is a mistake in mentioning the share and that Vishal Yadav
			<lb />
			has 1/4th share because his sister also has a share. Be that as it
			<lb />
			may, even if this statement was accepted, Vishal Yadav&apos;s paying
			<lb />
			capacity would still be over Rs.5 crores.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			877. The quantification of the fine must take into consideration
			<lb />
			the fact that they are being sentenced for conscious acts in
			<lb />
			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

			<lb />
			he does not have the paying capacity to pay an enhanced fine.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			879. We may note that so far as unwarranted hospital visits are
			<lb />
			concerned, the same has been dealt with separately and not as part
			<lb />
			of the compensation discussion in the present discussion. Based on
			<lb />
			the discussion and findings reached, we have opted to separately
			<lb />
			issue directions against the defendants for the same. The directions
			<lb />
			to the defendants to make payments with regard to the hospital
			<lb />
			visits and admissions are not in the nature of an order to pay a fine.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			880. The inquiry undertaken under our orders discloses that Vikas
			<lb />
			Yadav and Vishal Yadav have the capacity to pay an appropriate

			fine.

			<lb />
			considered by us and also made a sharp analysis of the facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances which are on record. These issues are extremely
			<lb />
			relevant for the purposes of sentencing making it necessary for us
			<lb />
			to deal with the various submissions and contentions, some of

			Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

			<lb />
			lost sight of by courts in the criminal justice dispensation system.
