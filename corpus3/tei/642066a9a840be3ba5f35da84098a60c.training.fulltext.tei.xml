			<lb />
			an amount of Rs 7 crores.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3.
			<lb />
			During the course of argument, Mr. V.G. Pradhan, the learned
			<lb />
			Special Public Prosecutor appearing on behalf of the prosecution
			<lb />
			submitted that the prosecution did not wish to press charges in respect
			<lb />
			of the transaction dated 07/02/1992 and 11/02/1992 i.e transaction
			<lb />
			No.4 and 5 since it was essentially a transaction which was in respect
			<lb />
			of the accused Manubhai Maniklal who had expired during the
			<lb />
			pe ndency of the trial.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			It is the case of the prosecution that so far as the first transaction
			<lb />
			is concerned i.e dated 10/10/1991, the funds to the tune of Rs 17.29
			<lb />
			crores were diverted in favour of accused Nos. 9 and 10 and accused
			<lb />
			No.6 through the Bank of India. In respect of the second transaction,
			<lb />
			which was for an amount of Rs 12 crores, the funds were diverted in
			<lb />
			favour of accused Nos.6 and 7 through the Bank of India and in
			<lb />
			respect of the third transaction dated 16/01/1992 the funds to the
			<lb />
			tune of Rs 5 crores were diverted in favour of accused No.5 through
			<lb />
			the Andhra Bank and in respect of the fourth and fifth transaction, the
			<lb />
			funds were diverted in favour of late Manubhai Maniklal.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			The prosecution has examined 19 witnesses in order to establish
			<lb />
			that these funds were diverted from Canfina and eventually these
			<lb />
			funds landed in the hands of accused/brokers, who utilised the same
			<lb />
			and, thereafter, this money came to be refunded to Canfi.na alongwith
			<lb />
			interest.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			It is essential to briefly state the transactions which are involved
			<lb />
			in this particular case. It is alleged by the prosecution that S. Mohan -
			<lb />
			accused No.1 made an entry dated 10/10/1991 in Canfina&apos;s book
			<lb />
			regarding purchase of &quot;RlL&quot; from Canbank Mutual Fund for Rs 17.29
			<lb />

			Narbharam Harakchand, which was a firm in which Ketan V. Parekh
			<lb />

			<lb />
			were associated.
			<lb />
			Thereafter, th.is amount of Rs 17.29 crores was
			<lb />
			illegally passed on to the said brokers who did not have any deal
			<lb />
			either with Canfina or with CBMF in connection with the receipt of the
			<lb />
			said amount.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>

			conspiracy, N. Balasubramaiam -accused No.2 made an entry dated
			<lb />
			22/10/1991 in the Canfina records regarding purchase of &quot;14°/o NCDs&quot;
			<lb />
			for Rs 12 crores from c.anbank Mutual Fund while Canfina did not
			<lb />
			have any such deal with CBMF. It is alleged that even then tq�
			<lb />
			amount of Rs 12 crores was transferred to Canbank Mutual Fund,
			<lb />
			Mumbai by Canfina, Bangalore on 22/10/1991. On receipt of the
			<lb />
			amount in CBMF, a voucher was prepared showing the said receipt of
			<lb />
			Rs 12 crores as &quot;wrongly remitted&quot; from Canfina which was being paid
			<lb />
			to S.K Jhaveri, as per Canfina&apos;s instructions and, accordingly, an
			<lb />
			amount of Rs 12 crores received in CBMF from Canfina without any
			<lb />
			deal was passed on to S.K. Jhaveri -accused No.6 who did not have
			<lb />
			any deal eit her with Canfina or with CBMF in connection with the
			<lb />
			receipt of the said amount.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			It is alleged by the prosecution that N. Balasubramaniam -
			<lb />
			accused No.2 made an entry dated 16/01/1992 in Canfina&apos;s record
			<lb />
			regarding purchase of 14% of NCDs from Canba� Mutual Fund for
			<lb />
			an amount of Rs 5 crores, though Canfina did not have any such deal
			<lb />
			with Canbank Mutual Fund (hereinafter called as &quot;CBMF&quot;). It is
			<lb />
			alleged that after this amount was received, accused No.4 -P.J.
			<lb />
			Subbarao issued directions to Canara Bank, Tamarind Lane Branch,
			<lb />
			Bombay to credit this amount in &quot;Cansigo Scheme&quot;, though CBMF was
			<lb />
			not connected in any way with the said amount. It is alleged that after
			<lb />
			this amount was credited in the Cansigo Scheme, it was transferred to
			<lb />
			the account of Hiten P. Dalal -accused No.5 who did not have any

			<lb />
			no such deal either from Canfina or with CBMF and this amount was
			<lb />
			transferred to CBMF on the basis of the said entry. After this amount
			<lb />
			was received in CBMF, accused No.4 issued a cheque dated
			<lb />
			10/02/1992 in favour of late Manubhai Maniklal though he did not
			<lb />
			have any deal either with Canfina or with CBMF.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			It is the prosecution case that, similarly, accused No.2 -N.
			<lb />
			Balasubramaniam made entry dated 11/02/1992 in Canfina&apos;s record
			<lb />
			showing purchase of 14% NCDs for Rs 7 crores from CBMF though
			<lb />
			Canfina did not have deal with CBMF and this amount was transferred
			<lb />
			to CBMF for the purchase of NCDs. When this amount was credited in
			<lb />
			the account of CBMF, accused No.4 -P.J. Subbarao alongwith another
			<lb />
			Officer signed cheque dated 11/02/1992 in favour of late Manubhai
			<lb />
			Maniklal who, again, did not have any deal with Canfina or with
			<lb />
			CBMF.
			<lb />
			The prosecution case, further, is that an amount of Rs
			<lb />
			53,77,82,500/-was received from Mis V.B. Desai on 31/03/1992 and
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Canfina, Bangalore through an IBA which was signed by Mr. It
			<lb />
			Venugopal who was not made an accused in the trial. It is the
			<lb />
			prosecution case that by virtue of these five transactions, an amount of
			<lb />
			Rs 47,70,68,200/-was utilized by the brokers and again remitted back
			<lb />
			wit h interest. The amount of Rs 53,77,82,500/-was transferred on

			is a Company registered under the Companies Act and clause 20 of the

			<lb />
			Government Units and other securities including shares. Under clause
			<lb />
			21, Canfina was empowered to lend, advance money with or without
			<lb />
			security.
			<lb />
			It, however, prohibited Canfina from doing business of
			<lb />
			banking as defined in the Banking Regulation. Act. The Canbank
			<lb />
			Mutual Fund is a trust and it was authorized to make investments in
			<lb />
			shares as also to lend money and make advances .. Clause lS(iii ) of its
			<lb />
			Trust Deed empowered the Trustees of the CBMF to (a) acquire, hold,
			<lb />
			manage, trade and dispose off shares and debentures &amp; (b) borrow or

			otherwise raise money with or without securities subject to the limits
			<lb />

			<lb />
			General Manager and member of the Board of Trustees of CBMF,
			<lb />
			accused No.4 -P.J. Subbarao was the Assistant General Manager,
			<lb />
			Canbank Mutual Fund, Bombay, accused No.5 -Hiten P. Dalal was
			<lb />
			share/stock &amp; finance broker, accused No.6 -S.I&lt;. Jhaveri was a
			<lb />
			share/stock broker, accused No.7 -Pallav Seth was share/stock broker,
			<lb />
			accused No.8 M.K. Ashok Kumar at the relevant time was the Assistant
			<lb />
			Vice President of Canfina, Bangalore, accused No. 9 -Ketan V. Parekh
			<lb />
			was also share/stock broker, accused No.10 -Navinchandra N. Parekh
			<lb />
			was also a share/stock broker and accused No.11 -B.V. Srinivasan was
			<lb />
			the Funds Manager, Canbonus.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			11. All the accused were charged for the offences punishable under
			<lb />
			section 120-B read with section 403, 409, 467, 471, 477-A of the
			<lb />
			Indian Penal Code and section 13(l)(c) read with section 13(2) of the
			<lb />
			Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			12. Accused No.1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 were alleged to have
			<lb />
			committed substantive offences under section 403, 409 and 477-A of
			<lb />
			the Indian Penal Code.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			13. Accused Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 were alleged to have committed
			<lb />
			substantive offences under section 13(l)(c) read with section 13(2) of
			<lb />
			the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and under sections 403, 477A,
			<lb />
			405, 409, 467, 471 of the Indian Penal Code.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			14. In a nutshell, therefore, it is the prosecution case that the modus
			<lb />
			operandi in these five transactions which was adopted by the accused
			<lb />
			was that the offi cials of the three Institutions viz. Can bank Financial
			<lb />
			Services Limited, Canbank Mutual Fund and &apos;F&apos; &amp; &apos;f Section of Canara
			<lb />
			bank entered into criminal conspiracy in Bombay and other places
			<lb />
			during 1991-92 with Mis Narbheram Harakchand, Hiten P. Dalal, S.K.
			<lb />
			13
			<lb />
			Jhaveri, Pallav Seth and Manubhai Maniklal who were stock brokers
			<lb />
			from Bombay to divert funds from the three Financial Institutions in
			<lb />
			favour of the brokers and to create a record on the basis of
			<lb />
			misrepresentation of facts and falsification of documents so as to
			<lb />
			indicate that the Canfina has placed funds with Canbank Mutual Fund
			<lb />
			for the purchase of non-convertible debentures but, in actual reality,
			<lb />
			no such transaction of purchase of non-convertible debentures had
			<lb />
			actually taken place and, in this manner, funds to the tune of Rs
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			47,70,68,200/-were illegally placed in the hands of brokers. The
			<lb />
			prosecution case is, therefore, that the accused persons during the
			<lb />
			period from October, 1991 to April 1992 in order to defraud the
			<lb />
			Canbank Financial Services Limited at Bangalore of the said amount,
			<lb />
			forged various documents and made fi ve ready forward deals of RIL
			<lb />
			and 14% NCDs securities with CBMF at Mumbai and, thereby,
			<lb />
			diverted funds of Canfina at Bangalore to Mumbai and thereafter
			<lb />
			diverted funds of Canfina at Bangalore to CBMF at MU J? bai so that the
			<lb />
			amount could be diverted for the use of accused Nos. 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10
			<lb />
			and, thereafter, again, false and fictitious entries were made to rnake it
			<lb />
			appear that the said deals were reversed.

		</p>
		<p>
			25. Mr. Kale , the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of accused
			<lb />
			No.5 submitted that the defence taken by the accused No.5 was not
			<lb />
			an afte rthought since he had already given an explanation and no tice
			<lb />
			was issued under section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code. He
			<lb />
			further submitted that the information which was furnished had been
			<lb />
			corroborated by the respective replies by the other persons involved in
			<lb />
			the transaction. He thirdly submitted that no investigation has been
			<lb />
			carried out to find out whether the explanation which was given by
			<lb />
			the accused No.5 was false. He further invited my attention to the
			<lb />
			notice which was given to the Corporation Bank being Exhibit A-5 ( 4)
			<lb />
			and the Credit Voucher dated 16/01/1992.
			<lb />
			He also invited my
			<lb />
			attention to the notice given to the Andhra Bank at Exhi bit A-5 (2) and
			<lb />
			the reply given by the Canfina at Exhibit-A-5 (1) conf irming what was
			<lb />
			said by the accused No.5. He submitted that the Canfina has, in fact,
			<lb />
			paid that amount on 16/01/1992. He submitted that the accused
			<lb />
			No.5 was involved by the prosecution in Charge Nos. 1, 9, 10, 11, 22,
			<lb />
			23, 39 and 40. He invited my attention to the statements of P.W.2,
			<lb />
			P.W.4, P.W.9, P.W. 12 and P.W. 13. He submitted that the statement
			<lb />
			of these witnesses cannot establish the case of the prosecution. He
			<lb />
			invited my attention to the various documents such as Cheque No.
			<lb />
			587664, Exhi bit-106, Exhi bit-51 and Exhibit-52.
			<lb />
			He has also
			<lb />
			commented on the statement of P.W. 12 and submitted that the
			<lb />
			evidence given by this witness does not in any way connect the
			<lb />
			accused No.5 with the commission of the alleged offence. He further
			<lb />
			submitted that the adverse inference was liable to be drawn on
			<lb />
			account of the non-examination of the witnesses particularly in
			<lb />
			respect of the evi dence to establish the agreement. He relied upon
			<lb />
			the following judgments of the Apex Court:-
			<lb />

			<lb />
			He has also tendered written submissions. In a nutshell his arguments
			<lb />
			can be summarized as under:-
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(a) In respect of the charge of conspiracy, he
			<lb />
			submitted that the charge, as framed, does not
			<lb />
			arise out of the charge-sheet filed in the Court
			<lb />
			and, therefore, the charge was unsustainable
			<lb />
			in law.
			<lb />
			He submitted that the charge was
			<lb />
			silent as to which part of the conspiracy was
			<lb />
			invoked by the prosecution in respect of the
			<lb />
			alleged offence. He submitted that the charge,
			<lb />
			even on the basis of the evidence led by the
			<lb />
			prosecution, falls to the ground as no evidence
			<lb />
			has been led in support of the prosecution
			<lb />
			case. He then submitted that so far as charge
			<lb />
			Nos. 9th and 11th are conce rned, accused
			<lb />
			N o.5 was not in any way connected which
			<lb />
			could be seen from the evi dence of witnesses.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			He further submitted that the charge Nos.
			<lb />
			22ndly and 23rdly are based on the allegation
			<lb />
			that the accused No.4 was instrum�ntal in
			<lb />
			making payment to the accused No.5 and th.is
			<lb />
			was fa lsified by the evidence of P.W. 9.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) He su b�itted that the prosecution has not
			<lb />
			examined the witnesses from CBMF who were
			<lb />
			signatories of Exhibit-51 who could have been
			<lb />
			deposed about the payment of 16/01/1992
			<lb />
			which would have established the innocence
			<lb />
			of accused No.5.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(c) He submitted that so far as accused No.5
			<lb />
			is concerned, the only relevant date was
			<lb />
			16/01/1992. He submitted that the defence
			<lb />
			of the accused No.5 is th.at on 15/01/1992, at
			<lb />
			the instance of CBMF, he had issued a cheque
			<lb />
			of Rs 5 crores favo uring Corporation Bank by
			<lb />
			way of aceommodation and that the said
			<lb />
			amount was returne d on 16/01/1992 and that
			<lb />
			he did not receive any amount from Canf ina.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(d) He submitted that none of the documents
			<lb />
			on which reliance has been placed by the
			<lb />
			prosecution establish their case. None of the
			<lb />
			oral evidence which is brought on record
			<lb />
			supports the prosecution case.
			<lb />
			He further
			<lb />
			submitted the reliance has been placed by the
			<lb />
			prosecution on the judgment of the Apex
			<lb />
			Court in Maruti&apos;s case but it can be
			<lb />
			distinguished in the facts and circumstances of
			<lb />
			this case.
			<lb />
			Further detailed submissions of Mr. Kale will be discussed at the
			<lb />
			appropriate stage.

			<lb />
			Narichania, who was the co-accused at the relevant point of time, was

			later on dropped as an accused and he was also not examined by the
			<lb />
			prosecution. He submitted that even if the prosecution case is taken
			<lb />
			-
			<lb />
			as it is, it would establish that the accused No.6 had no way of
			<lb />
			knowing that the amount belonged to Canfina. He submitted that the

			P.W.9 in his statement has categorically admitted that he had never
			<lb />
			informed the accused No.6 -S.K. Jhaveri.

			documents at Exhibit A-6(18) clearly established that a substantial
			<lb />
			payment was made by the accused No.6 to Canbank after 11/10/1991

			and this was not in consonance with the conduct of the person who
			<lb />

			nut shell he submitted as under: -
			<lb />
		</p>

			<lb />
			The documentary evi dence which was

			Seth -accused No.7 was dealing with the
			<lb />

			FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			31. After having perused the oral and documentary evidence on
			<lb />
			record, in my view, prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt
			<lb />
			the charges against accused Nos. 1, 8, 3, S, 6, 7, 9 &amp; 10. However, it
			<lb />
			has fa iled to establish charges levelled against accused Nos. 2, 4 &amp; 11
			<lb />
			for the following reasons set out hereinafter.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			32. Between 01/04/1991 to 06/06/1992, it was noticed by the
			<lb />
			Government that there were large scale irre gularities in banking
			<lb />
			transactions and funds of Public Sector Undertakings whi ch were
			<lb />
			invested in Nationalized and other Banks were siphoned off for the
			<lb />
			purpose of dealing in public securities and these huge amounts whi ch
			<lb />
			were utilized fo r the purchase of public securities were not backed up
			<lb />
			by any physical securities or other collateral securities such a.S BR, SGL
			<lb />
			etc. Soon, thereafter, the scam broke out and the inve stigation was
			<lb />
			made and a report was submitted by a Committee which is popularly
			<lb />
			known as Jankiranian Committee, which disclosed large scale
			<lb />
			irregularities which were committed by Public Sector Undertakings,
			<lb />
			Mutual Funds, Nationalized Banks with the help of brokers. The
			<lb />
			inve stigation was made by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
			<lb />
			and criminal complaints were re.gistered against various persons. ln
			<lb />
			the present case, complaint was lodged on 1/6/1994 at 15.00 hours
			<lb />
			and, in the complaint 11 persons were shown as accused viz (1) Shri
			<lb />
			S. Mohan, Assistant Vi ce President, Canfina Bangalore, (2) Shri N.
			<lb />
			Balasubramaniam, Assistant Vice President, Canfina, Bangalore, (3)

			<lb />
			Officer, Canara Bank, F &amp; I Section, Bombay. In the said complaint, it
			<lb />
			was alleged that all the a. ccused and other stock brokers of Bombay
			<lb />
			had entered into criminal conspiracy and had siphoned off Rs
			<lb />
			47, 70,68,200/-and that the sai d amount was returned back without
			<lb />
			interest illegally. In the complaint, details of these five transactions
			<lb />
			have been mentioned and the refund alongwith interest was also
			<lb />
			indicated. It was alleged that certain amounts were paid to Pallav
			<lb />
			Seth, though, at that time, he owed several crores of rupees to Canfina
			<lb />
			and, in the said process, Canfina suffered a loss of Rs 3,12,58,715.76
			<lb />
			and interest with effect from 2/4/1992 till filing of the complaint.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			33. The charge-sheet was filed on 24/9/1996 and, out of the
			<lb />
			accused mentioned in the FIR, the name of Shri � Ve nugopal was
			<lb />
			dropped.
			<lb />
			Shri Manubhai Maniklal had expired by that time and,
			<lb />
			therefore, his name was also dropped from the charge-sheet.
			<lb />
			Similarly, though the charge-sheet was
			<lb />
			fi led against Shri Anil
			<lb />
			Naricha nia and Shri Vi naychandra N. Parekh, their names were also
			<lb />
			dropped. The . sanction to prosecute was granted by K.N. Karnath,
			<lb />
			Chairman and Managing Director of Canbank Financial Services Ltd

		<p>
			35. During the course of arguments, the Learned Public Prosecutor
			<lb />
			Mr. V.G. Pradhan made a statement that he was not pressing charges
			<lb />
			in respect of transactions dated 7 /2/1992 and 11/2/1992 in respect of
			<lb />
			remittance of Rs 5 crores and Rs 7 crores from Canf ina to late
			<lb />
			Manubhai Maneklal.
			<lb />
			Hence, we are concerned with only three
			<lb />
			transactions of remittances viz dated 10/10/1991, 22/2/1991 and
			<lb />
			16/01/1992 and reversal to the tune of Rs 53,77,82,500/-.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			36. Before 1 deal with the evidence on record and consider the rival
			<lb />
			submissions, it is essential to take into consideration the organizational
			<lb />
			set up of the three financial institutions viz (a) Canbank Financial
			<lb />
			Services, Bangalore (Canfina), (b) Canbank Mutual Fund, Bombay
			<lb />
			(CBMF) and (c) Canban.k (F &amp; 1 Section), Bombay. It is also necessary
			<lb />
			to briefly consider the manner in which Canfina entered into
			<lb />
			transactions of sale and purchase of securities.
			<lb />
			70
			<lb />
			37. Canfina is 100% subsidiary of Canbank. Canf ina was carrying
			<lb />
			on business of leasing, higher purchase and merchant ban.king
			<lb />
			activities. As a part of merchant banking activities, Canfi na made
			<lb />
			investments in stocks and also in the secondary marke t i.e sale and
			<lb />
			purchase of shares. P.W.S in his evidence has stated that he joined
			<lb />
			Canara Bank in December, 1971 and in November, 1992 he was
			<lb />
			deputed to Canfina as an Assistant Vice President and he has brought
			<lb />
			on record Memorandum and Articles of Association and the same are
			<lb />
			marked at Exhibit-57. Canfi.na is registered under the Companies
			<lb />
			Act and
			<lb />
			clause 20 of the Arti cles/Memorandum of Association,
			<lb />
			authorized Canfina to make invesnnents in unit Government and other
			<lb />
			securities, including shares. Under clause 21 Canfina was empowered
			<lb />
			to lend, advance money with or without security. However, by virtue
			<lb />
			of the said clause, it was prohi bited from doing any business of
			<lb />
			banking as defined in the Banking Regulations Act. Canfina has its
			<lb />
			local Office in Mumbai and also has its accounts in Canara Bank,
			<lb />
			Mumbai. (Emphasis supplied) .
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			38. Accused No.1 -S. Mohan was Assistant Vice President and was
			<lb />
			working at the registered Office of Caf ina at Bangalore. Accu sed No.8
			<lb />
			-M.K. Ashok Kumar was Executive Vice President, working in the
			<lb />
			same Office and accused No.2 -N. Balasubramaniam was Assistant
			<lb />
			Vice President working in the back-up department of the same Office.
			<lb />
			P.W.2 -Mr. B.N. Srikantha has said so in his evidence in para 6. He
			<lb />
			has also stated that accused No.8 -M.K. Ashok Kumar and accused
			<lb />
			No.1 -S. Mohan were authorized to buy and sale securities on behalf
			<lb />
			of Canfina.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			39. Canbank Mutual Fund (CBMF) is a trust and it was authorized
			<lb />
			to make investments in shares and also lend money and make
			<lb />
			advances and it had accounts in Tam arind Lane Branch of Canara
			<lb />
			Bank, Bombay. Clause 15 (iii) of the Trust Deed empowered the
			<lb />
			trustees (a) to acquire, hold, manage, trade and dispose off shares and
			<lb />
			debentures &amp; (b) borrow or othe IWise ra ise money with or without
			<lb />
			securities subject to the limits as may be decided by the Trustees.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			at.hara Bank is a nationalized Bank and it is a main trustee of CBMF
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			40.
			<lb />
			All the scheduled banks which are nationalized or otherwise

			<lb />
			time and these directions were issued under section 21 and 35A of the

			<lb />
			he was handling institutions business.
			<lb />

		<p>

			<lb />
			Prosecution, in order to establish its case has not been in a
			<lb />
			position to bring on record any direct evidence in respect of the
			<lb />
			alleged criminal conspiracy hatched between the accused. It has,
			<lb />
			however, attempted to prove the charge of criminal conspiracy by
			<lb />
			trying to bring on record move ment of funds from Canfina to Canbanl&lt;
			<lb />
			Mutual Fund (CBMF) and from there to the respective brokers and
			<lb />
			again return of funds from the brokers to Canbank Mutual Fund
			<lb />
			(CBMF) and, ultimately, to Canfina. Through the evidence of Canfi.na
			<lb />
			employees, the prosecution has stated the manne r in which the
			<lb />
			purchase and sale of securities were made and the procedure that was
			<lb />
			fo llowed in respect of keeping of record.
			<lb />
			The prosecution has
			<lb />
			examined CBMF employees to show that they had received funds and
			<lb />
			the documents to establish conspiracy have been brought on record .
			<lb />
			Thereafter, the accounts of the individual brokers in various banks,
			<lb />
			such as Bank of India, Bank of America, Andhra Bank etc. have been
			<lb />
			brought on record to show that these amounts were credited in the
			<lb />
			said accounts. Correspondingly, the prosecution case is that though
			<lb />
			the purchase or sale of securities is reflected in Sauda Book, purchase
			<lb />
			of these securities viz &quot;RIL&quot; &amp; 1114% NCDs&quot; on the relevant date on
			<lb />
			which purchase was made has not figured in Sauda Book and,
			<lb />
			therefore, it has sought to argue that these transactions of purchase of
			<lb />
			securities were fictitious and bogus transactions and the money, in
			<lb />
			fact, was siphoned off through brokers. Further, it is argued that
			<lb />
			entries were made to show that there was a wrong remittance of that
			<lb />
			particular amount, as reflected in the transaction of each of the three
			<lb />
			dates (because in respect of two transactions i.e of Rs 5 crores and Rs
			<lb />
			7 crores, charge s have not been pressed by the prosecution) and these
			<lb />
			documents were later on altered to show that the wrong remittance
			<lb />
			was repai d.
			<lb />
			It is argued that, initially, it was shown in these
			<lb />
			documents that wrong remittance was made to CBMF and, later on,
			<lb />
			word &quot;CBMF&quot; was scored off. It is argued that this was done to
			<lb />
			suppress transfer of funds from CBMF to the brokers and when the
			<lb />
			amo.unt was repaid, it was not shown that it was repaid by CBMF to
			<lb />
			Canfi na.
			<lb />
			Prosecution has laboriously brought on record all these
			<lb />
			documents to establish the link of travelling of funds from Point-A i.e.
			<lb />
			from Canfina to Point-8 i.e. CBMF to Point-C i.e. broke rs and Point-D
			<lb />
			i.e. again re-flow of money to Canfina. It is argued, the.refore, that
			<lb />
			without ensuring rec�ipt in physical form of securities when purchases
			<lb />
			were made, huge amounts in crores of rupees were diverted. It is
			<lb />
			argued by the prosecution that accused No.1 -S.Mohan and accused
			<lb />
			No.8 -M.K. Ashok Kumar were not authorized to deal in purchase and
			<lb />
			sale of securities beyond the particular limit and yet, without
			<lb />
			authority, they had allegedly entered into the said transaction and,
			<lb />
			therefore, they had committed an offence of criminal breach of trust
			<lb />
			punishable under section 409 of I.P.C. and had misappropriated the
			<lb />
			amo.unt and committed an offence punishable under section 403 of
			<lb />
			1.P .C. and section 13 (1) (c) read with section 13 (2) of the Prevention
			<lb />
			of Corruption Act and, for that purpose, had created fabricate d
			<lb />
			documents and, therefore, had committed an offence punishable under
			<lb />
			section 477-A of I.P.C.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			44. In the present case, submission made by the leamed counsel for
			<lb />
			the accused that th.ere is no direct or indirect evidence to show that
			<lb />
			there was conspiracy to divert funds from Canfina to the broke rs,
			<lb />
			cannot be accepted. It is well settled law that it is difficult to get
			<lb />
			direct evidence in re spect of conspiracy to commit an offe nce and in
			<lb />
			case of circumstantial evidence the chain of circumstances has to be
			<lb />
			•
			<lb />
			established which points out to the guilt of the accused. In the
			<lb />
			present case, the prosecution, inter alia, has successfully brought on
			<lb />
			record all the documentary evidence to establish that Can.fin.a is a
			<lb />
			Company registered under Co�panies Act but it is 100% subsidiary
			<lb />
			Company of a Canara Bank which is a nationalized bank. Though
			<lb />
			article 21 of the Articles of Association permits Canfina to buy and sell
			<lb />
			securities and or to lend money with or without security, by virtue of
			<lb />
			77
			<lb />
			the provisions of section 21 of the Banking Regulations Act and the
			<lb />
			guide-lines lai d down by the RBI from time to time �hich have
			<lb />
			statutory force, it did not have the authority to lend money since this
			<lb />
			could be done only by the bank within the meaning of the provisions
			<lb />
			of section 21 of the Banking Regulations Act and, admittedly, Canfi.na
			<lb />
			was not a bank within the meaning of the said section. It has come in
			<lb />
			evidence that CBMF was not purchasing or selling securities on behalf
			<lb />
			of Canfina.
			<lb />
			P.W. 9
			<lb />
			has stated in his evidence that CBMF was not
			<lb />
			purchasing or selling securities on behalf of Canfina. This evidence
			<lb />
			has not been cha llenged by any of the accused.
			<lb />
			That being the
			<lb />
			position,, there was no question of remitting the various amounts
			<lb />
			which were remitted in different transactions to CBMF. CBMF, on the
			<lb />
			other hand, after having received money from Canfina which,
			<lb />
			according to the vouchers which were prepared by their officials viz.
			<lb />
			accused No.3 and 11 clearly indicated that the amount was wrongly
			<lb />
			remitted from Canfina to CBMF and, in such cases, where there were
			<lb />
			wrong remittances received, the
			<lb />
			money had to be sent back to
			<lb />
			Canfina. The accused No.3, on the contrary, remitted the amount to
			<lb />
			the brokers viz. accused Nos.S,, 6,, 7, 9 and 10. It has been brought on
			<lb />
			record that on the very same day when the payment was made
			<lb />
			from
			<lb />
			Canfina to CBMF, either on the same day or one day before that,
			<lb />
			cheques were prepared for the same amount for being remitted in
			<lb />
			fav our of brokers viz. accused Nos. 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 and the brokers,
			<lb />
			in tum, on the same day, had made remittances to various parties
			<lb />
			though the balance in their account was not sufficient. This clearly
			<lb />
			indicates that there was complete chain and all the accused had
			<lb />
			knowledge that the amount would be remitted from Canfina and on
			<lb />
			the same day the amount would be remitted from CBMF to the
			<lb />
			brokers. The chain, th.erefore, is established from the various entries
			<lb />
			which are made in the account of the respective brokers and the
			<lb />
			vouchers were pre pared by CBMF.
			<lb />
			On the other hand, fictitious
			<lb />
			entries in the Deal Pad were made and though physical securities and
			<lb />
			Bank Receipts were not obtained, the amount was remitted. No entry
			<lb />
			was made in the Sauda Book. The vouchers which were prepared viz
			<lb />
			Exhi bit-178 etc. indicate that the amount was shown to have been
			<lb />
			wrongly remitted to �BMF and instead of immediately remitting the
			<lb />
			amount back to Canfina, this amount was sent to the brokers who
			<lb />
			utilized the money and, thereafter, remitted the . amount back after it
			<lb />
			was used for their own purposes. The theory of the accused that there
			<lb />
			were regular transactions in respect of purchase and sale of securities,
			<lb />
			therefore, falls to the ground and the case of the prosecution that
			<lb />
			fictitious entries were made for the purpose of remitting the amount
			<lb />
			with this fact, there is evi dence on record to show that CBMF was not
			<lb />
			dealing in purchase or sale of securities on behalf of Canf ina. If
			<lb />
			Canfina wanted to purchase and sale securities it could have done so
			<lb />
			by showing that there were ostensible purchase and sale transactions
			<lb />
			stands established from the evidence which has been brought on
			<lb />
			record. This evidence dearly establishes that accused Nos. 1 and 8
			<lb />
			had no authority to enter into transactions beyond the particular limit
			<lb />
			yet, without obtaining sanction from the higher officers, they created
			<lb />
			record showing the Deal Pad entries and remitted the amount to
			<lb />
			CBMF. At that end i.e. at CBMF&apos;s end, accused Nos. 3 and 11 received
			<lb />
			money, created vouchers to show that the amount is wrongly received
			<lb />
			from Canfina and yet paid that amount to the brokers.
			<lb />
			This
			<lb />
			establishes that there was no actual transaction! It has been argued
			<lb />
			on behalf of the accused that there is no basis for the prosecution ca � e
			<lb />
			th.at all transactions of purchase and sale of securities were entered in
			<lb />
			the Sauda Book. Even assuming for the sake of arguments that this is
			<lb />
			true, yet the vouchers which were prepared by the officials of CBMF
			<lb />
			sho� that there was no such transaction, otherwise they would have
			<lb />
			created a record to indicate that the amount was received for the
			<lb />
			purchase of R1L and NCO securities. On the contrary, the vouchers
			<lb />
			indica te that the amount was wrongly remitted to CBMF. Coupled
			<lb />
			with this fact, there is evidence on record to show that CBMF was not
			<lb />
			dealing in purchase or sale of securities on behalf of Canfina. If
			<lb />
			Canfina wanted to purchase and sale securities it could have done so
			<lb />
			111 its own right by contacting the brokers directly. This further
			<lb />
			establishes that there was a conspiracy, therefore, to use the officials
			<lb />
			of the CBMF as conduit to siphon off the money from Canfina. The
			<lb />
			offence of conspiracy, therefore, in my view has been dearly
			<lb />
			established. The ratio of the judgment of the Apex Court in Bfiln
			<lb />
			Narayan Popli Vs. CBI reported in (2003) 3 SCC 641,. therefore, is
			<lb />
			clearly applicable to the facts of the present case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			45.
			<lb />
			Considering the evidence which is brought on record, in my
			<lb />
			view, the prosecution has established flow of funds in the aforesaid
			<lb />
			transactions viz dated 10/10/1991, 22/10/1991 and 16/01/1992 and
			<lb />
			reversal of funds back to Canfin.a.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			46. First, however, I would like to discuss the evidence which is on
			<lb />
			record in respect of three transactions and the reversal transaction. I
			<lb />
			will do so transaction• wise.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			47. However, before that, very briefly, I would like to discuss the
			<lb />
			evidence which is brought on record, regarding the purchase of shares
			<lb />
			by Chief Dealer and dealer of Canfina at Bangalore.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			48.
			<lb />
			P.W. 6 has in his evidence stated the procedure which is
			<lb />
			followed in respect of purchase transaction and sale transaction.
			<lb />
			P.W. 6 was promoted as Executive Vice President in 1991. He has
			<lb />
			stated in his evidence that accused No.8 -M.K. Ashok Kumar was
			<lb />
			authorized to undertake sale and purchase transactions in shares on
			<lb />
			behalf of Canfina and that accused No.1 -S. Mohan was working
			<lb />
			unde r accused No. 8 -M.K. Ashok Kumar. He has stated that the
			<lb />
			Board had delegated powers to M .. K. Ashok Ku mar -accused No.8.
			<lb />
			Accused No. 1 -S. Mohan, however, was given limited powers under
			<lb />
			the Portfolio Management Scheme of buying and selling securities and,
			<lb />
			the refore, he had no powers to undertake sale and purchase
			<lb />
			transactions in shares and securities on behalf of Canfina. He has
			<lb />
			brought on record Exhi bit-17-
			<lb />
			sanction note No. 726, Exhibit-18
			<lb />
			which is minutes of the Board Meeting and Exhibit-19 which is the
			<lb />
			office note dated 23.9.1991. In the Board Note -Exhibit 17, the Board
			<lb />
			was asked to authorize accused No.8 -M.K Ashok Kumar to accept the
			<lb />
			funds for investments upto the limit of 100 crores per client and under
			<lb />
			clause 2, he was empowered to buy and sell securities on outright
			<lb />
			basis upto Rs 50 crores per transaction, the total not exceeding Rs 300
			<lb />
			crores per day for sale and purchase separately. Under Exhi bit-18
			<lb />
			which are minutes of the Board Meeting dated 30/11/1991, powers
			<lb />
			were delegated as recommended under Exhibit-17. By Exhi bit-19
			<lb />
			which is a office note dated 23. 9.1991, the Managing Director
			<lb />
			recommended delegation of powers to M. K. Ashok Kumar -accused
			<lb />
			No.8.
			<lb />
			The recommendations were made by accused No.2 -N.
			<lb />
			Balasubramaniam and K. B. Shenoy with further recommendations by

			Mr. P.N. Narayanrao who was the Executive Vice President. The office
			<lb />
			note was also signed by the Managing Director Mr. A.P. Rao.

			<lb />
			In his evi dence P.W.6 Mr.K.Ashok Kumari Kini(hereinafter
			<lb />
			referred to as &quot;A.K. Kini&quot; in order to avoid confusion as accused No.8 is
			<lb />
			M.K.Ashok Kumar) has given details regarding the manner in which
			<lb />
			the purchase and sale transactions were made. In the transactions, dt.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			10.1.91, 22.10.91 &amp; 16.1.92 since we are concerned with purchase of
			<lb />
			shares, I shall give details regarding the manner of purchase of shares
			<lb />
			as stated by P.W. 6-A.K. Kini. In para 13,14 and 15 of his evidence
			<lb />
			P.W. 6-A.K. Kini has deposed to the effect that &quot;In case of purchase of
			<lb />
			shares, the transactions were concluded by the chief dealer of Canfina
			<lb />
			at Bangalore on telephone with the brokers. On conclusion of the deal,
			<lb />
			he would note it down in Sauda Book and the payment for those
			<lb />
			purchases as and when it is to be made it is decided upon by the Chie f
			<lb />
			dealer and he would give instructions on telephone to the Canara Bank
			<lb />
			Branch in Bombay to make the payment on behalf of Canfina. While
			<lb />
			instructing, he would also convey on telephone the IBA number. The
			<lb />
			Chief dealer himself would write down the JBA number which is given
			<lb />
			to the Canara Bank Bombay, in the IBA Issue . Register. The IBA is
			<lb />
			prepared by the Back office as per. instructions; IBA register would
			<lb />
			contain IBA number, date, and the Canara Bank Branch name and the
			<lb />
			amount. On the bas�s of these details the back office would prepare
			<lb />
			the �eque favouring the Canara Bank Branch in Bangalore. On the
			<lb />
			basis of that cheque, the C�ra Bank Branch would prepare IBA
			<lb />
			which is generally taken delivery of by Funds Dept. of Canfina,
			<lb />
			Bangalore and sent over to the Canara Branch in Bombay. The Canara
			<lb />
			Bank at Bangalore would de bit the account of Canf ina by the amount
			<lb />
			of the cheuqe.
			<lb />
			In so far as Canfina&apos;s own transaction of sale and
			<lb />
			purchase, the ave rment.s are that the vouchers are prepared for sale
			<lb />
			and purchase on the basis of Sauda book.
			<lb />
			These vouchers are
			<lb />
			prepared at intervals and not on daily basis. In case of purchases and
			<lb />
			sales on behalf of Portfolio clients are concerned, similar vouchers are
			<lb />
			prepared by the Bank Department of the Funds Department� The
			<lb />
			Vouchers would contain the nature of the security, quantum, purchase
			<lb />
			or sale rate, the brokers name and the aggregate amount receivable or

			60. P.W. 9 has then stated
			<lb />
			that, normally, if the amount was
			<lb />
			wrongly received, it would be sent back to the sender. He has stat�d
			<lb />
			that in this transaction there was deviation from this normal practice.
			<lb />
			He has stated that accused No.11 -B.V. Srinivasan who was working
			<lb />
			as Pund Manager, CBMF, instructed his Secretary P.W. 1 Ms Virakt:Hl
			<lb />
			Hegcde to prepare voucher. Accordingly, she prepared a voucher in her

			<lb />
			This voucher has been produced at Exhibit-178 by P.W.19. In the
			<lb />
			upper part of the document, there is a mention of &quot;Can bonus&quot; and the
			<lb />
			debit entry amount is Rs 17.29 crores. This amount was debited to

			<lb />
			Srinivasan -accused No. 11. The lower part of the document -Exhibit-

			<lb />
			In this endorsement the words &quot;remitted to Canfina
			<lb />
			Bangalore&quot; were scored off and the word &quot;repai d11 was written. P.W.1
			<lb />
			has stated that she has done this as per the instructions of Mr. B.V.
			<lb />
			Srittivgsan -accused No. 11. (Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			61.
			<lb />
			Accu sed No. 11 -B.V. Srinivasan, after giving instructions and
			<lb />
			after preparation of voucher at Exhibit-178, prepared two cheques in
			<lb />
			his bWn. handwriting whicH are signed by himself and another accused
			<lb />
			No.3 -B.R. Acharya, Officer of CBMF. One cheque is dated
			<lb />
			10/10/1 991 fo r a sum of Rs 8,99,00,000/-bearing No.488905 issued
			<lb />
			Srinivasan and accu sed No.3 -B.R.. Ac.b.arya and another cheque dated

			10/10/1 991 fo r a sum of Rs 8,30,00,000/-bearing No.488906 issued
			<lb />
			in favour of Mis Narbheram Harakchand and signed by accused No.11
			<lb />
			and accused No.3. Both these cheques are on record at Exhibits 14
			<lb />
			and 15 respectively. The prosecution•s case there fore, is that on the
			<lb />
			one hand accused No.11 had created fa lse record to show that the
			<lb />
			amount was wrongly received from Canfina and credited to the
			<lb />
			account of CBMF and, on the other hand, instead of remitting the
			<lb />
			amount back to Canf ina, the amount was given in two cheques to
			<lb />
			accused Nos.6 and accused Nos. 9 &amp; 10.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			62. Accused No.11 -B.V. Srinivasan in his argument has submitted
			<lb />
			that he had written those cheuqes on the instructions of accused No.3-
			<lb />
			B.R. Acharya who was his superior officer .and he was merely
			<lb />
			implementing the directions given by accused No.3. Accused No.3, on
			<lb />
			the other hand, has taken different defence, which will be considered
			<lb />
			at the appropriate stage.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			63. The prosecution has exhibited a common attendance register
			<lb />
			which was kept by CBMF at Exhibit-105 and entries regarding
			<lb />
			attendance of accused No.3 -B.R. Acharya on 10th, 11th and 12th
			<lb />
			October, 1991 were brought on record at Exhi bit-105(2) collectively.
			<lb />
			This was shown to establish that &apos; accused No.3 -B.R.. Acharya was not
			<lb />
			in Mumbai but he was at Bangalore for official duty. This document
			<lb />
			has been brought on record by P.W.9. The entries in respect of
			<lb />
			attendance of accused No.11 -B.V. Srinivasan would show that he was
			<lb />
			present on 10th, lltlt and 12th October, 1991 and these entries are
			<lb />
			marked at Exhibit 105(3) collectively. This was shown to establish
			<lb />
			that accused No.11 was present on the said dates.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			64. ln order to establish that this amount was, in fact, deposited in
			<lb />
			the account of M/s Narbheram Harakchand, the prosecution examined
			<lb />
			P.W. 18 Mr. Mukesh Jo shi (Exhi bit-144). P.W. 18 has stated that Mis
			<lb />
			Narbheram Harakchand was having account with the Bank of India,
			<lb />
			Stock Exchange Branch and, at th.at ti.me, accused No.9 -Ketan Parekh
			<lb />
			and accused No. 10 -Navinchandra Parekh were the partners. He has
			<lb />
			stated that he used to prepare cheques as per instructions of accused
			<lb />
			No. 9 -Ke tan Parekh.
			<lb />
			The details were also given by him fo r
			<lb />
			preparation of the cheques and he also used to give narration of the
			<lb />
			transactions. In respect of cheques received from other parties, they
			<lb />
			used to be deposited in the firm account in the Bank of India, Stock
			<lb />
			Exchange Branch by P.W. 18 or other staff members. He has stated
			<lb />
			that cheque No.488906 dated 10/10/1991 for Rs 8,30,00,000/-issued
			<lb />
			in fa vour of Mis Narbheram Harakchand is signed by the accused
			<lb />
			No. 11 -B.V. Srinivasan and accused No.3 -B.R. Acharya of CBMF and
			<lb />
			this . cheque which is at Exhi bi t-15 was deposited in the account of the
			<lb />
			firm being account No. 14010. This was deposited by way of credit
			<lb />
			slip for a sum of Rs 8,56,06,450/-and, on the reverse side of the

			<lb />
			26,06,450. The credit slip has been exhi bited at Exhi bit-111. The
			<lb />
			prosecution has, therefore, established that the cheque which was to
			<lb />
			be remitted back to Canfina was , in fact, remitted to accused Nos. 9
			<lb />
			and 10, the partners of Mis Narbheram Harakchand by the cheque
			<lb />
			which is at Exhi bit-�5 which was signed by accused No.11 -B.V.
			<lb />
			Srinivasan and accused No.3 -B.R. Acharya. This cre�it slip has been
			<lb />
			brought on record by P.W. 10 -Diiip Jagmohandas Ummergaonwak.

			<lb />
			of M/s Narbheram Harakchand bearing account No.14010 from
			<lb />
			03/10/1991 to 311io;1991 with Bank of India, Stock Exchange
			<lb />
			Branch.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			65.
			<lb />
			After the sai d amount was received, accused No. 10 •
			<lb />
			Navinchandra
			<lb />
			Parekh issued cheque of Bank of India bearing
			<lb />
			No.577597 dated 10/10/1991 for Rs 8,25,00,000/• in fa vour of S.K.
			<lb />
			Jhaveri • accused No.6. This che que was signed by accused No.10 •
			<lb />
			Navinchandra Parekh. This cheque is at Exhibit• 112. The prosecution,
			<lb />
			therefore has established that on the same day, after having received
			<lb />
			Rs 8,30,00,000/-, accused No.10 remitte d an amount of Rs
			<lb />
			8,25,00,000/-to accused No.6 -S.K. Jhaveri. Again, the state ment of
			<lb />
			account at Exhibit 113 and 113 (2) shows that accordingly debit entry
			<lb />
			was made after the payment of Rs 8,25,00,000/• in the account of Mis
			<lb />
			Narbheram Harakchand.
			<lb />
			Prosecution case, therefore, is that the
			<lb />
			accused No.10 -Navinchandra Parekh utilized the amount of Rs
			<lb />
			8,30,00,000/-which was illegally received from Canara Bank though
			<lb />
			there was no deal or transaction in respect of any security, much less
			<lb />
			purchase or sale of 140/o NCD. In the acco unt of Mis Narbheram
			<lb />
			Harakchand which is at Exhi bit-113, opening balance as on
			<lb />
			10/10/1991 was Rs 45,46,482.86 and dosing balance on that date
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			66.
			<lb />
			Out of the other cheue for Rs 17.29 crores which was received by
			<lb />
			CBMF, again accused No.3 -B.R. Acharya and accused No.11 -B.V.
			<lb />
			Srinivasan issued cheque bearing No.488905 dated 10/10/1991 for a
			<lb />
			sum of Rs 8,99,00,000/-in favour of Mis S.K. Jhaveri which was
			<lb />
			signed by both the accused and which is at Exhibit-14. This cheque
			<lb />
			was deposited by accused No.6 -S.K. Jhaveri in his account No.19186
			<lb />
			with Bank of India, Stock Exchange Branch, Mumbai by pay-in-slip of
			<lb />
			Bank of India on the _same date. The pay-in-slip has been brought on
			<lb />
			record by P. W. 11 -Mr. Kishore Mahadeo Aj gaonkar and is at Exhi bit-
			<lb />
			117 and the name and date of the cheque at Exhibit-14 t.ally with the
			<lb />
			pay-in-slip at Exhibit-117.
			<lb />
			Pros ecution has brought on record the
			<lb />
			statement of account of accused No.6 -S.K. Jhaveri bearing account
			<lb />
			No. 19186 with Bank of India, Stock Exchange Branch, Mumbai and
			<lb />
			this statement is at Exhibit-115 and the relevant entry in respect of
			<lb />
			sum: of Rs 8,99,00,000/-dated 10/10/1991 is marked at Exhi bit-
			<lb />
			115 (1). Further, the prosecution has brought on record a cheque
			<lb />
			bearing No.370306 issued by accused No.6 � S.I&lt;. Jhaveri dated

			09/10/1991
			<lb />
			for Rs 24,75,65,324/-in favour of Stock Exchange
			<lb />
			Clearing House which is at Exhibit-116. Pro secution case is that the
			<lb />
			opening balance of the said account was Rs 9,31,86,600.97 which is at
			<lb />
			Exhi bit-115 and the cheque in fa vour of Stock Exchange Clearing
			<lb />
			House could be issued by accused No. 6 -S.l{. Jhaveri only because
			<lb />
			these two amounts viz Rs 8.25 crores and 8.99 crores were credited
			<lb />
			into his account. The case of the prosecution is that, therefore, though
			<lb />
			accused No. 6 -S.K. Jhaveri had no transaction with canfina or with
			<lb />
			CBMF, these amounts were deposited in his account without any deal
			<lb />
			or security transaction and these amounts were utilized by him for
			<lb />
			other purposes.
			<lb />
			Accused No.6 -S.K. Jhaveri in his defence has
			<lb />
			submitted that he had sufficient amount in the Bank and that he had
			<lb />
			several transactions with CBMF and Canfina. This argument will be
			<lb />
			considered at length c:it the later stage
			<lb />
			The prosecution has, therefore, established the illegal move ment
			<lb />
			of funds in respect of the first transaction at the instance of accused
			<lb />
			Nos. 1 and 8 from Canfina to the account of CBMF and, thereafter, to
			<lb />

			<lb />
			record.

			<lb />

		<p>
			68. The payment for these purchases would be made by giving
			<lb />
			instructions on telephone to Canara Bank Branch, Mumbai who are
			<lb />
			instructed to make payment on behalf of Canfina.

			Similarly, Canbank Mutual Fund also has addressed a letter to the
			<lb />
			Manager, Canara Bank, Fort Market dated 25/10/1991 enclosing IBA
			<lb />
			No.32151 dated 22/10/1991 for a sum or Rs 12,00,00,000/-. The
			<lb />
			said letter is at Exhibit-103. Prosecution has. therefore. established
			<lb />
			that the amount of Rs 12.Q0.00.0 00/-which wa s remitted (rom
			<lb />
			Canfina was re ceiv ed by CBMF. He has further stated that the voucher
			<lb />
			dated 22/10/1991 was prepared in the handwriting of one Mr. Rajesh
			<lb />
			Pawar and it contained two portions; the upper portion was debit
			<lb />
			portion and the lower portion was credit portion and below the
			<lb />
			signature of Mr. Rajesh Pawar, P.W. 9 had signed since he had
			<lb />
			checked it. He has stated that accused No.4 -P J. Subbarao also had
			<lb />
			signed the voucher for giving his approval. This debit voucher is at
			<lb />
			Exhibit-102. P.W.9 has further stated that in the debit portion of the
			<lb />
			voucher, it is mentioned th.at the amount of Rs 12 crores was wrongly
			<lb />
			received from Canfina&apos;s Account. He has fu rther stated that credit
			<lb />
			portion of the document, however, showed that an amount of Rs 12
			<lb />
			crores was paid to S.K. Jhave ri vi de cheque No.587347 as per the
			<lb />
			instructions of Canfina, Bangalore. He has further stated that, in
			<lb />
			normal course if the amount was wrongly received by CBMF on
			<lb />
			account of Candgo&apos;s Current Account, it would have been remitted
			<lb />
			back to Canfina. However, in the present case, instead of remitting the
			<lb />
			amount to Canf ina, the amount was paid to S.K. Jhave ri by cheque
			<lb />
			No.�87347. He further stated that he did not personally know S.I&lt;.
			<lb />
			Jhaveri though, he was one of the brokers dealing with CBMF. The
			<lb />
			evidence of this witness establishes that though in the record of CBMF,
			<lb />
			the amount was wrongly received by CBMF, instead of remitting back
			<lb />
			the said amount, the money was paid to S.K. Jhaveri. This voucher at
			<lb />
			Exhi bit 102 was signed by accused No.4 -PJ. Subbarao.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			74. P.W. 9 -Mr Ravi Tirumali has further stated that one day before
			<lb />
			the transaction i.e. on 21/10/1991 Mr. B.R.. Acharya -accused No.3
			<lb />
			had asked him to prepare a cheque for Rs 12 crores favouring S.K.
			<lb />
			Jhaveri. He has stated that before the cheque was prepared, he has
			<lb />
			asked B.R. Acharya the reason why the cheque was to be prepared in
			<lb />
			favour of Jhaveri. He has stated that B.R. Acharya told him that he
			<lb />
			should prepare the cheque and bring it to him and, thereafter, he
			<lb />
			would inform him about the nature of transaction. He has stated that
			<lb />
			the cheque was prepared by him and he signed it and since the cheque
			<lb />
			had to be signed by one more signatory, he took the cheque to Anil
			<lb />
			105
			<lb />
			Narichan ia and when he did so he was asked by him about the nature
			<lb />
			of transaction involved. P.W. 9 has then stated that he informed him
			<lb />
			what was told to him by Mr. Acharya and, thereafter, Anil Narichania
			<lb />
			also signed the cheque. He then took the cheque to B.R. Acharya. The
			<lb />
			cheque was in the handwriting of Rajesh Pawar. P.W. 9 has furth er
			<lb />

			<lb />
			cheque was put as 22/10/1991. The cheque is at Exhibit-78. P.W.9
			<lb />
			has, therefore, established that the cheque was prepared at the
			<lb />
			instance of accused No.3 -B.R. Ach arya.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			75. P.W.9 has further stated that on 22/10/1991 accused No.4 -PJ.
			<lb />
			Subbarao informed P.W.9 that an amount of Rs 12 crores had been

			<lb />
			Cancigo Scheme.
			<lb />
			P.W. 9 has furthe r stated that the common

		<p>
			77. P.W.8 has further stated in his evidence that the opening balance
			<lb />
			in the said Account as on 22.10.1991 was Rs 1,57,89,472.23 and
			<lb />
			afte r the cheque was credited in the account, the amount was utilized
			<lb />
			for making payment to Mr. R.. R.. Bohra vide cheque dated 22/10/1991
			<lb />
			for Rs 59,37,000/-. The said cheque is also on record at Exhibit-80.
			<lb />
			He has stated that the another cheque of the same date for Rs
			<lb />
			1,11,78,600/-was issued by accused No.6 -S.K. Jhaveri in favour of
			<lb />
			Bank of India Ne. BOI Mutual Fund. The said cheque is also at
			<lb />
			Exhi bit-81. Another cheque dated 22/10/1991 for Rs 2,42,95,000/
			<lb />
			was issued by accused No.6 • S.I{. Jhaveri in favour of Bank of India
			<lb />
			Ne. BOI Mutual Fund drawn on Bank of America. This cheque is also

			<lb />
			same date for Rs 40,63,000/-issued by Shrenik Jhaveri -accused No.6
			<lb />
			in favour of Vikram Kedia is also brought on record. P.W. 8 has also

			<lb />
			on Bank of America and another cheque for Rs 50,40,000/-issued in
			<lb />
			favour of G.N. Hegde drawn on BOA.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			78. From this evidence, in my view, prosecution has established that
			<lb />
			the amount of Rs 12 crores was deposited in the Joint Account of
			<lb />
			accused No. 6 -Shrenik Jhaveri and accused No. 7 -Pallav Seth and
			<lb />
			this cheque was issued on the instructions of accused No.3 -B.R.
			<lb />
			Acharya. It has been urged by Mr. Pradhan, the learned Special Public
			<lb />
			Pro secutor on behalf of CBI that, because this amount was deposited in
			<lb />
			108
			<lb />
			the Joint Account, the accused No.6 and accused No.7 were in a
			<lb />
			position to make several payments to various parties.
			<lb />
			From the
			<lb />
			evi dence of P.W.8 and P.W. 9, the prosecution has tried to establish
			<lb />
			that B.R. Acharya -accused No.3 got the cheque of Rs 12 crores issued
			<lb />
			in the name of accused No.6 -S.K Jhaveri, though the debit voucher
			<lb />
			clearly indicated that an amount of Rs 12 crores was wrongly remitted
			<lb />
			from Canfina, Bangalore to CBMF and though B.R. Acharya -accused
			<lb />
			No.3 was aware of it, yet, he directed that the amount should be paid
			<lb />
			in the account of S.K Jhaveri. The accu sed No.6 and accused No.7
			<lb />
			had misutilised the funds which were not meant for them and have
			<lb />
			thereby misappropriated the said amount for the ir own use and
			<lb />
			accused Nos.1, 8, 3, 6, 7 have committed the offences punishable
			<lb />
			under sections 120-B read with sections 403, 409, 109 of the Indian
			<lb />
			Penal Code read with
			<lb />
			13(l)(c) &amp; 13(2) of the Prevention of
			<lb />
			Corruption Act with which they are charged.
			<lb />
			{Ill) PURCHASE. OF 14% NCDs FOR . RS. 5 CRQ RF.S
			<lb />
			FROM CBMF ON 16/01/1992
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			79.
			<lb />
			In this transaction, accused Nos. 2, 4, 5, 1 and 8 are alleged to
			<lb />
			have been involved. The beneficiary of the transaction is Hiten P.
			<lb />
			Dalal. The relevant charges in respect of this transaction are 9, 10, 11,
			<lb />
			22 and 23. To establish the charge s pertaining to this transaction,
			<lb />
			prosecution has examined P.W.1, P.W.2, P.W.6, P.W.4, P.W. 19, P.W.9
			<lb />
			and P. W. 12. The documents which are brought on record by the
			<lb />
			prosecution to establish these charges against the said accused are at
			<lb />
			Exhi bits 62,
			<lb />
			63 colly., 64 colly., 42, 27, 162, 28, 107, 106,
			<lb />
			51,
			<lb />
			X-18(2), 52, 121, 120(1), 120(5) colly. and Exhi bit 122.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			80.
			<lb />
			In this case also, the prosecution has alleged that the accu sed
			<lb />
			Nos. 1 and 8 created the record to show that there was purchase of
			<lb />
			14% NCDs at Rs 100/-from CBMF of Rs 5 crores on 16/01/1 992. A
			<lb />
			debit voucher was prepared, showing the sai d amount being debited in
			<lb />
			the account of Canfina and the CBMF, instead of remitting this amount
			<lb />
			to Canf ina, paid the sai d amount to Hiten P. Dalal -accused No.5 who
			<lb />
			utilised the said amount for his own purposes. The amount was
			<lb />
			remitted by informing CBMF IBA number. A deal pad entry was
			<lb />
			prepared by accused No.2 -N. Balasubramaniam. Thereafter, the
			<lb />
			cheque was issued in favour of CBMF.
			<lb />
			Though the amount was
			<lb />
			remitted, no entry was made in the Sauda Book. The IBA Issue Book
			<lb />
			shown the entry with regard to IBA which, in this case, was No.32686
			<lb />
			issued on Canara Bank, Tamarind Lane Branch, Bombay for Rs 5
			<lb />
			crores. P.W.1, P.W.2 and P.W. 6 have deposed about the manner in
			<lb />
			which the amount was remitted from Canfi na to CBMF, how the
			<lb />
			entries were made in the Deal Pad and how the amount which was
			<lb />
			received by CBMF was transmitted to accused No.S -Hiten P. Dalal.
			<lb />
			This amount was deposited in the account of accused No.5 -Hiten P.
			<lb />
			Dalal who issued a cheque in favour of Corporation Bank.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			opening balance of the Bank Account of accused No.S with Andhra
			<lb />
			Bank showed that after this amount was deposited in his Account, he
			<lb />
			returned it for issuing RBI cheue dated 16/01/1992 in favour of CBMF
			<lb />
			and, therefore, on account of receipt of said cheque of Rs 5 crores from
			<lb />
			CBMF, sufficient balance was made available to him to enable him to
			<lb />
			issue a cheque dated 15/01/1 992 in favour of Corporation Bank. The
			<lb />
			deal pad entry is at Exhibit-62.
			<lb />
			The IBA No.32686 is in the
			<lb />
			handwriting of accused No.2 -N. Balasubramaniam and it is at
			<lb />
			Exhibit-42. The Sauda Book which is at Exhibit 63 colly. and 64 colly.
			<lb />
			discloses that no entry has been made in the Sauda Book in respect of
			<lb />
			this transaction. The cheque bearing No. 999551 dated 16/1/1992
			<lb />
			which was issued in favour of CBMF is at Exhibit-27. The Statement of
			<lb />
			Account of Current Account No. 26645 maintained by Canfina with
			<lb />
			Canara Bank, Cunningham Road Branch, Bangalore is at Ex.hi bit-162.
			<lb />
			The telegraphic transfer application is at Exhibit-28 whi ch mentioned
			<lb />
			IBA No.32686. The Canbank Mutual Fund rubber stamp indicates that
			<lb />
			the amount was transferred to CBMF. The telex confirmation about
			<lb />
			receipt of this amount is at Exhibit-50(1) wherein IBA No.32656 is
			<lb />
			mentioned. Exlu&apos;bit-107 is a letter which shows that the remittance of
			<lb />
			Rs 5 crores had come from Canara Bank, Cunningham Road Branch,
			<lb />
			Bangalore to CBMF. The Statement of Account is at X-18(2). The
			<lb />
			debit voucher which was prepared is at Exhibit-106 and wh ich is
			<lb />
			signed by P.W.9. The cheque bearing No.587664 dated 16/01/1992
			<lb />
			of Canara Bank for a sum of Rs 5 crores is at Exhibit-51.
			<lb />
			On
			<lb />
			16/0 1/1992, requisition fo rm of Canara Bank fo r issuing bankers
			<lb />
			cheque along with cheque dated 16/01/1992 bearing No.587664 for a
			<lb />
			sum of Rs 5 crores was received by P.W. 4 -A jay Kumar N. Kar, Officer
			<lb />
			working in Tamarind. Lane Branch. The requisition form is at Exhibit-
			<lb />
			52.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			81. P.W.4 has stated that on the basis of cheque at Exhibit-51 and
			<lb />
			requisition form at Exhibit-52, he issued banker cheque under his
			<lb />
			signature dated 16/01/1992 for Rs 5 crores in favour of Andhra Bank
			<lb />
			credit to H.P. Dalal for Rs 5 crores. He also made an entry in the
			<lb />
			Cheque Issue Register at serial No. 11/92 and made an endorsement
			<lb />
			&quot;BC/11/92&quot; on the requisition fo rm at Exhi bit-52. P.W. 12 -Vasanth
			<lb />
			Kumar Damaraj u has stated that during the course of investigation,
			<lb />
			Andhra Bank, vide its letter No.755/1/238 dated 26/08/ 1994
			<lb />
			informed that they received Pay Order No.992040 dated 16/01/1992
			<lb />
			from Canara bank with covering letter to credit the amount to H.P.
			<lb />
			Dalal&apos;s Account. The letter dated 26/08/1994 is at Exhibit-119.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			82.
			<lb />
			After the Pay Order No.992040 dated 16/01/1992 was received
			<lb />
			by Andhra Bank, the credit voucher was prepared for a sum of Rs
			<lb />
			6,52,25,290/-coveting two cheques; one for Rs 5 crores for pay Ord�r
			<lb />
			No.992040 and another for Rs 1,52,25,290/-. This voucher showe d
			<lb />
			that an amount of Rs 6,52,25,290/-was to be credited to the Account
			<lb />
			of H.P. Dalal. P.W. 12 has brought on record the said voucher and it i5
			<lb />
			exhibited at Exhibit-121.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			83. In my view, from the evidence which is brought on record it has
			<lb />
			been established by the prosecution that accused Nos. 1 and 8
			<lb />
			remitted an amount of Rs 5 crores by creating false and fictitious
			<lb />
			documents in respect of purchase of 14% NCDs for Rs 5 crores from
			<lb />
			CBMF on 16/01/1992 and it is further established that CBMF in its
			<lb />
			own record prepared a voucher showing that the amount was wrongly
			<lb />
			received from Canfina and instead of remitting the amount back, this
			<lb />
			amount was remitted by accused No.3 by giv ing directions and
			<lb />
			instructions to accused No.11. The accused No.11, being a junior
			<lb />
			Offi cer, was duty bound to follow the instructions and the amount was
			<lb />
			remitted from CBMF to the account of Hiten P. Dalal in Andh.ra Bank.
			<lb />
			Further, the evidence of P.W. 12 clearly indicates that this amount was
			<lb />
			utilized by Hiten P. Dalal for making payment to the Corporation
			<lb />
			Bank.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			84. P.W. 12 -Vasanth Ku mar Damaraju was working with Andhra
			<lb />
			Bank between May 1994 and July 1998. He has brought on record
			<lb />
			entries in the Statement of Account of H.P. Dalal and they are marked
			<lb />
			as Exhibit 120(5) colly. He has further stated that before credit of the
			<lb />
			said cheque of Rs 5 crores as of 16/01/1992 in H.P. Dalal&apos;s Acco1,.1nt
			<lb />
			No.4819 with Andhra Bank, the balance was Rs 48,50,5 10.15. He has
			<lb />
			stated that, thereafter, there was a credit of Rs 25,96,95,205.48 in his
			<lb />
			account on receipt of cheque from CBMF and the account was
			<lb />
			simultaneously debited for issue of RBI cheque dated 16/01/1992
			<lb />
			favouring CBMF for Rs 25,42,70,230.48 and after the credit and debit
			<lb />
			entries the balance of Rs 54,24, 755/-remained in H.P. Dalal&apos;s
			<lb />
			Account. The Statement of Account is exhibited at Exhi bit-120.
			<lb />
			114
			<lb />
			Prosecution case is that on receipt of the said cheque for Rs 5 crores,
			<lb />
			sufficient balance was made available to H.P. Dalal, as a result of
			<lb />
			which he could issue cheque No.985279 dated 15/01/1992 in favour
			<lb />
			of Corporation Bank and the rubber stamp on the reverse of the
			<lb />
			cheque indicates that the cheque was sent to Corporation Bank. This
			<lb />
			cheque is brought on record at Exhibit-122. The entry showing the
			<lb />
			amount which was debited in the account of H.P. Dalal is marked as
			<lb />
			Exhi bit-120(2).
			<lb />
			In th.is evi dence it has been • established that the
			<lb />
			accused No. 5 -H.P. Dalal pai d an amount of Rs 5 crores to
			<lb />
			Corporation Bank by sending cheque dated 15/01/1992.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			85.
			<lb />
			The prosecution has, therefore, established that the amount of
			<lb />
			Rs 5 crores was siphoned off from Canfina via CBMF and it was paid to
			<lb />
			Hiten P. Dalal when there was no actual transaction of purchase of
			<lb />
			14% NCD securities and bogus vouchers were prepared to create the
			<lb />
			impression that there was actual purchase of these securities and, as a
			<lb />
			result of the money which was made available, H.P. Dalal could pay Rs
			<lb />
			5 crores to Corporation Bank and, •therefore, he utilized the money
			<lb />
			which did not belong to him and misappropriated the sai d amount.
			<lb />
			H.P. Dalal -accused No.S, on the other hand, has .submitted that the
			<lb />
			amount of Rs 5 crores was paid by him by cheque dated 15/01/1992
			<lb />
			which is one day before the said amount was deposited in his Account.
			<lb />
			It is his case that this amount was paid as and by way of adjustment as
			<lb />
			was directed by citiban.k. This defence would be considered at a
			<lb />
			subse quent stage.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			86.
			<lb />
			In respect of remaining two transactions, out of fi ve transactions
			<lb />
			dated 07 /02/1992 and 11/02/1992 in respect of Rs 5 crores and Rs 7
			<lb />
			crores respectively, Mr. V.G. Pradhan, the learned Special Public
			<lb />
			Prosecutor appearin� on behalf of the prosecution has made a
			<lb />
			statement across the bar that since the concerned broker had died
			<lb />
			during the pendency of the case, the prosecution did not wish to press
			<lb />
			these two transactions and, therefore, he did not make any
			<lb />
			submissions regarding these two transactions. It will, therefore, be not
			<lb />
			necessary to refe r to the evidence which is brought on record by the
			<lb />
			prosecution and in defence by the accused in respect of these two
			<lb />
			transactions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			FURTIIE R DIVERSION AND REVERSAL:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			87. Pro secution case is that the amount which was siphoned off in
			<lb />
			an illegal manner from Canfina to the tune of Rs 47 crores
			<lb />
			app roximately was again brought back, illegally, to the tune of Rs
			<lb />
			116
			<lb />
			5 3, 77 ,82,500/-and, therefore, there is a difference between what was
			<lb />
			remitted from Canfina and what was brought back which difference
			<lb />
			works out to Rs 6,07,14,300/-. Out of this amount, further amounts
			<lb />
			were paid to the brokers and balance of about rupees one crore and
			<lb />
			odd remained with Canfina. Prosecution case is that, therefore, there
			<lb />
			was a temporary misappropriation and, later on, these funds which
			<lb />
			were ostensibly paid for purchase transactions were again brought
			<lb />
			back ostensibly for sale transactions. It would be relevant to see what
			<lb />
			is the evidence regarding sale transactions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			88.
			<lb />
			P.W.6 in his evidence has mentioned how the sale transaction by
			<lb />
			Canfina used to normally take place . He has stated in his evi dence
			<lb />
			that the sale transaction normally originates because of two reasons
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(1) to generate funds and (2) to take advantage of the price movement
			<lb />
			in the market and as and when the situation arises in this manner,
			<lb />
			brokers were contacted over telephone by the Chief Dealer Mr. M.K.
			<lb />
			Ashok Kumar -accuse d No.8 and sometimes by S. Mohan -accused
			<lb />
			No.1 and, thereafter, the transactions were concluded with the broker.
			<lb />
			The sale transaction involved quantity of the shares and the price and,
			<lb />
			thereafter, contract notes would come from the broker and wo uld be
			<lb />
			monitored by the Back-up Department or by the dealers themselves.
			<lb />
			Thereafter, the deliveries and realisation of the sale proceeds also were
			<lb />
			monitored by the dealers. He has furt1ler st ated that in case of shares.
			<lb />
			delivery always used to be in physicals. In respec t of other securities.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			however. sometimes delivery used to be in phys ical or by BR or b_y
			<lb />
			SGL. In case of sale transaction, payment used to be received at the
			<lb />
			point where the brokers were situated and the payments were received
			<lb />
			at the Canara Bank, Bombay and transmitted to Canfina&apos;s account in
			<lb />
			Bangalore by way of telephonic instructions followed by IBAs. In case
			<lb />
			of sale transactions the broker would deposit the cheque with Canara
			<lb />
			bank with instructions to make onward remittances to Canfina,
			<lb />
			Bangalore.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, the Canara Bank, on realisation of the
			<lb />
			cheque, would send onward remittance to Canfina Bank Bangalore by
			<lb />
			telephonic instructions to Canfina first then followed by IBA in favo ur
			<lb />
			of Canara Bank Branch, Bangalore.
			<lb />
			These instructions would be
			<lb />
			received in the Funds Department, Canfina Bank, Bangalore and the
			<lb />
			information would come to the Chief Dealer or the dealer and
			<lb />
			sometimes in the Back-up Department. The IBAs would be received in
			<lb />
			the Funds Department of Canfina at Bangalore and, thereafter, the
			<lb />
			IBAs would be forwarded to the Canara Bank Branch in Bangalore .
			<lb />
			Actual receipt of IBAs would take two to thre e days. However, the
			<lb />
			cred.it would be given by the Bank ui Canf ina&apos;s account on the basis of
			<lb />
			telephonic instructions received by the Funds Department. On receipt
			<lb />
			of telephonic instructions, the concerned Officer would transmit those
			<lb />
			instructions to the Bank in writing on the basis of which the credit
			<lb />
			would be given by the Bank. On getting the written instructions by the
			<lb />
			Bank, it would prepare dummy IBA and give credit to the Canfina&apos;s
			<lb />
			account. On receipt of the original IBA in the Funds Department of
			<lb />
			Canfi.na, the same would be sent to the Bank and the Bank would
			<lb />
			replace the dummy IBA by the original IBA. He has stated further that
			<lb />
			in this manner, nothing would remain in the Funds Department of
			<lb />
			Canfina and the said Funds Department would . not keep any record
			<lb />
			with regard to the receipt of telephonic instructions. After the
			<lb />
			conclusion of the sale transaction, it would be entered in the Sauda
			<lb />
			Book maintained by the Chief Dealer.
			<lb />
			In case of sale of other
			<lb />
			securities, the Chief Dealer would first note the fact of conclusion of
			<lb />
			the deal on a rough sheet and at the end of working hours, the rough
			<lb />
			sheet would be handed over to the Back-up Department. The Back-up
			<lb />
			Department would note all these deals in the Deal Pad. (Emphasis
			<lb />
			supplied)

		<p>
			89. Prosecution case is that the Canara Bank&apos;s Funds Management
			<lb />
			Department was managing the funds on behalf of Canfina and on
			<lb />
			31/03/1 992, total sum of Rs 70, 77,82,500/-was received on behalf of
			<lb />
			Canfina through different remittances.
			<lb />
			One of the remittances
			<lb />
			included cheque dated 31/03/1992 for Rs 30 crores from. Standard
			<lb />
			Chartered Bank. In the records of Canfina, the cheque was treated as
			<lb />
			consolidated receipt for Canfina&apos;s two sale deals viz (i) for sale of
			<lb />
			securities of Rs 15 crores to Ml s. Growmore Research and Asset.s
			<lb />
			Manage ment Ltd. and (ii ) sale of securities for Rs 13 crores to M/s.
			<lb />
			V.B. Desai. In view of this, an amount of Rs 2 crores was found 11an
			<lb />
			excess&apos;1 receipt of Rs 2 crores and, therefore, this amount of Rs 2 crores
			<lb />
			was paid by banker&apos;s cheque No.822329 dated 31/03/1992 favo uring
			<lb />
			Harshad S. Mehta and it was credited to his account in the State Bank
			<lb />
			of Saurashtra. This cheque was issued by R. Venugopal and it was
			<lb />
			countersigned by K.D. Prabhu.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			90.
			<lb />
			P.W.13 has stated in his evi dence th.at after the amount was
			<lb />
			appropriated on account of transaction with Harshad S. Mehta, the
			<lb />
			balance of Rs 53,77,82,500/-was treated as receipt from Mis V.B.
			<lb />
			Desai and entries were accordingly made into Canfina books . M/s.
			<lb />
			V.B . Desai had remitted the said amount to Canfina as per unwritten
			<lb />
			instructions of Pallav Seth -accused No. 7.
			<lb />
			Against the said
			<lb />
			remittances dated 31/03/1992, M/s V.B. Desai had received shares of
			<lb />
			equal value from Pallav Seth -accused No.7. P.W. 13 in his evi dence
			<lb />
			has stated that the entry in respect of amount of Rs 53,77,82,500/-is
			<lb />
			in his handwriting and there is mention of IBA No.F/214/92 dated
			<lb />
			31/03/1992. He has stated that, in this entry, there is no mention
			<lb />
			regarding either any purchase or sale transaction. The particulars of
			<lb />
			the transaction also are not mentioned. The said entry is marke d at
			<lb />
			Exhi bit-124. Prosecution case is that, therefore, though there was no
			<lb />
			transaction, the said entry has been made and, therefore, the amounts
			<lb />
			were received by Canfina, Bangalore by IBA dated 31/03/1992 being
			<lb />
			No.F/2 14. The said IBA is at Exhib it-70.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			91. It is alleged by the prosecution that, therefore, there was no
			<lb />
			transaction of purchase or sale and after the amount was received, it
			<lb />
			was appropriated towards
			<lb />
			(i) sale of 17.29 crores RIL @ 100, (ii)
			<lb />
			12 crores 14% NCD @ 108.04 and (iii ) 17 crores 140/o NCD @ 102.66
			<lb />
			and it was shown th.at against the transaction of purchase of securities
			<lb />
			which were at Rs 47,70,68,200/-an amount of Rs 53,77,82,500/-was
			<lb />
			received and, as such, there was an excess amount received by Canfina
			<lb />
			to the tune of Rs 6,07,14,300/-
			<lb />
			92. Again P.W.2 in his deposition has stated that there was a deal
			<lb />
			pad dated 31/3/1992 in which the above mentioned three
			<lb />
			transactions have been mentioned and the said excess amount was
			<lb />
			shown to be paid on 02/04/1992. Similarly P.W. 6 -A.I&lt;. Kini has
			<lb />
			stated that in the afore said three transactions of sale of securities there
			<lb />
			was a mention of &quot;RFR&quot; in Deal Pad at Exhi bit-48 which means ready
			<lb />
			forward reversal transaction. He has stated that this showed that the
			<lb />
			sale was by way of reversal of earlier ready fo rward transaction. P.W.
			<lb />
			6 has referred to Exhi bits 48, 59 and 61.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			93. P.W. 2 has again stated in his evidence that on 02/04/1992,
			<lb />
			accused No.2 -N. Bal.c:tsubramaniam made an entry in the dealers pad
			<lb />
			of Canfina regarding transfer of Rs 20,92,14,300/-to accused No. 7 -
			<lb />
			Pallav Seth by IBA No.33242 and the following details were
			<lb />
			mentioned in Canfina&apos;s deal pad viz (i) Amount excess received on
			<lb />
			31/03/1 992 payable Rs 6,07,14,300/-, (ii) Payment towards 85,000
			<lb />
			shares of Nahar Spinning @ 1500 i.e. Rs 12,75,00,000/-and (iii )
			<lb />
			15,000 shares of Castrol @ 1400 which comes to Rs 12,10,00,000/-,
			<lb />
			t h us total Rs 20,92,14,300/-. The said entries were brought on record
			<lb />
			at Exhi bits 4 6 and 47. He has further stated that accused No.8 caused
			<lb />
			to be issued IBA No.33262 dated 02/04/1992 fo r consolidated amount
			<lb />
			of Rs 20,92,14,300/-which was inclusive of Rs 6,07,14,3 00/-plus an
			<lb />
			122
			<lb />
			amount of Rs 12,75,00,000/-being payment towards purchase shares
			<lb />
			of Nahar Spinning and also an amount of Rs 2,10,00,000/-being
			<lb />
			payment towards purchase of shares of Castrol without receipt of any_
			<lb />
			cost memo, contract note or security in physical or in the form of Bank
			<lb />
			Receipt. He has stated that, accordingly, deal pad entry was made and
			<lb />
			it was used to prepare cheque for a sum of Rs 20,92,14,300/-which
			<lb />
			was signed by accused No.2 -N. Balasubramaniam and, accordingly,
			<lb />
			rubber stamp of Canara bank indicated that the amount had been
			<lb />
			transferred to Tamarind Lane Branch of Canara Bank, Bombay vide
			<lb />
			cheque at Exhi bit-33. This cheque at Exhibit-33 was deposited with
			<lb />
			Canara Bank, Cunningham Road Branch, Bangalore which is refl ected
			<lb />
			in the Statement of Account No.26645 maintained by Canfina, which
			<lb />
			is at Exhi bit-162. Accordingly, a credit slip was prepared in the Back
			<lb />
			up Department of Canfina, Bangalore and the credit was given for the
			<lb />
			said sum in respect of che que at Exhibit-33 and the credit slip is
			<lb />
			brought on record at Exhibit-34.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, cheque bearing
			<lb />
			No.082331 dated 02/04/1992 for Rs 20,92,14,300/-came to be issued
			<lb />
			at CBMF end. P.W. 8 has brought it on record at Exhi bit-76. This
			<lb />
			cheque was give n to Pallav Seth, who deposited the cheque bearing
			<lb />
			No.82331 in Bank of America by pay-in-slip dated 02/04/1992 in to
			<lb />
			account No.4941 -011 of Pallav Seth -accused No.7. The pay-in-slip is
			<lb />
			at Exhibit-77.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			94. Accused No. 7 -Pallav Seth and accused No. 6 -S.K. Jhaveri had
			<lb />
			joint account in their name in the Bank of America. The cheque and
			<lb />
			pay-in-slip at Exhibits-76 and 77 were deposited in the sai d account
			<lb />
			and the credit entry is reflected in the Statement of Account E:xhibit-38
			<lb />
			and the entry is at Exhi bit-38(1).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			95. Now in re spect of purchase of 85000 shares of Mis Nahar
			<lb />
			Spinning Mill , it is the case of prosecution that shares were purchased
			<lb />
			@ 1500/-per share though the rate of share at the relevant point of
			<lb />
			time was Rs 800/-to Rs 900/-per share and, therefore, accused No.8 -
			<lb />
			M.K. Ashok Kumar caused Canfina to pay Rs 600/-per share and, as
			<lb />
			such, total loss of Rs 5.10 crores was caused to Canfina and
			<lb />
			corresponding gain to sai d accused No. 7 -Pallav Seth. To prove this
			<lb />
			fact, prosecution has examined P.W.17 -Yogesh Bhambardekar
			<lb />
			working with Bombay Stock Exchange, who has stated about the
			<lb />
			original quotation sheets for that particular period which were brought
			<lb />
			on record at Exhibits-137 to 143 and relevant entries were brought on
			<lb />
			record at Exhibits 137A(l) to 143A(l). Prosecution has examined
			<lb />
			P.W.7 who has stated that Mis Nahar Spinning Mills had informed
			<lb />
			124
			<lb />
			Bombay Stock Exchange vide their letter dated 12/02/1 992 ab out
			<lb />
			record date for their right issue as 25/03/1992 and, therefore, under
			<lb />
			BSE rules, transactions upto 20/02/1992 were on cum rights basis and
			<lb />
			from 21/02/1992 onwards were on ex-rights basis . He has stated
			<lb />
			that accused No.8 -M.K. Ashok Kumar did not take any contract note
			<lb />
			from Pallav Seth -accused No.7 in connection with the said purchase
			<lb />
			of 85000 shares of M/s. Nahar Spinning Mills and there by caused
			<lb />
			payment of Rs 12,75,00,000/-to be made to Pallav Seth -accused
			<lb />
			No. 7 without adequate safeguards and th.at the Canfina was able to
			<lb />
			receive shares only after gap of one year. P.W. 7 has further stated in
			<lb />
			his cross-examination that he was aware of the terms &quot;cum rights&quot; and
			<lb />
			&quot;ex-rights&quot;.
			<lb />
			He has explained that the meaning of the term &quot;cum
			<lb />
			rights&quot; was share purchased before the record date I no delivery
			<lb />
			period fixed for issue of the right shares and the meaning of the term
			<lb />
			&quot;ex-rights&quot; was that the transposition was concluded after the record
			<lb />
			date or no delivery period. He has further state d that he does not
			<lb />
			remember whether in 1992 any right shares were issued by Nahar
			<lb />
			Spinning Mills Ltd. The case of the prosecution is that, against the
			<lb />
			payment of Rs 12,75,00,000/-made to Pallav Seth -accused No.7 for
			<lb />
			purchase of 85000 shares of Mis Nahar Spinning Mills, no steps were
			<lb />
			taken by Canfina for effecting delivery from Pallav Seth -accused No. 7
			<lb />
			till mid July 1992 and after the scam was known to the public at large,
			<lb />
			fax message from Canfina bearing No. 725/92 dated 18/07 /1992 was
			<lb />
			addressed to accused No.4 -P .J. Su bbarao which read as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;As of 25.03.1992, we bought Rs 85,000
			<lb />
			shares of Ml s. Nahar Spinning Mills through
			<lb />
			Pallav Sheth -accused No. 7, we understand
			<lb />
			that Pallav Sheth Accused No.7 inadvertently
			<lb />
			delivered the shares to you and you had
			<lb />
			lodged the shares for transfer in your name
			<lb />
			and also applied fo r the rights issue
			<lb />
			thereunder&apos;&apos;.
			<lb />
			The shares &quot;inadvertently&quot; delivered to CBMF could be restored to
			<lb />
			Canfina sometimes in April 1993. P.W. 7 -Mr. M. Pappa Rao, Officer
			<lb />
			of CBMF has stated about the procedure with respect to registration of
			<lb />
			Nahar Spinning Ltd. He has explained the procedure in his evi dence
			<lb />
			through documents whi ch are at Exhi bits 73/1 to 73/2 6.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			96. The details of another transaction have been given by P.W. 8 -
			<lb />
			Mr. Pronab Ray wherein he has mentioned that accused No.2 -N.
			<lb />
			Balasubramaniam made an entry in the dealers pad dated
			<lb />
			08/ 04/1992 regarding purchase of 40000 shares of Ace @ Rs 6,250/-
			<lb />
			per share from Pallav Seth -accused No.7. The deal was finalised by
			<lb />
			accused No. 8 -M.K. Ashok Kumar and on the basis of the said entry,
			<lb />
			the amount of Rs 25 crores was transferred on 08/04/1992 to Canfina
			<lb />
			Mumbai for credit of the same in the account of Pallav Seth -accused
			<lb />
			No.7. A cheque bearing No.082334 dated 08/04/1992 for Rs 25
			<lb />
			crores was issued and the same was deposited in the joint account of
			<lb />
			accused Nos. 6 -Shrenik Jhaveri and accused No.7 -Pallav Seth in
			<lb />
			the Bank of America.
			<lb />
			The said cheque for Rs 25 crores dated
			<lb />
			08/04/1992 is brought on record at Exhibit-99.
			<lb />
			The pay-in-slip
			<lb />
			through which the cheque was deposited is at Exhi bit-100 an.d the
			<lb />
			Statement of Account is at Bxhi bit-38. The relevant entry is at Exhibit-
			<lb />
			38(2).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			97. P. W. 8 has further stated that after receipt of Rs 25 crores on
			<lb />
			08/04/1 992 from Canfina, Pallav Seth -P.W.7 utilized the said
			<lb />
			amount by issuing cheques to various parties The said cheques are
			<lb />
			on record at Exhi bit-87 to Exhi bit-98.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			98. Thus, the prosecution has established that various amounts were
			<lb />
			deposited in the joint account of accused No. 6 -S.I&lt;. Jhaveri and
			<lb />
			accused No. 7 -Pallav Seth and that after the said amounts were
			<lb />
			deposited, various cheques were issued by accused No. 7 -Pallav Seth
			<lb />
			to various parties. The counse l appearing on behalf of accused No. 7,
			<lb />
			inter alia, has argued that price of Rs 1500/ � per share included in
			<lb />
			share of right issue and, therefore, no loss was caused to Canfina and,
			<lb />
			therefore, no offence is committed by accused Nos 6 to 8.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			99. Having seen the evidence which is brought on record by the
			<lb />
			prosecution in respect of three transactions regarding purchase of
			<lb />
			NCD securities and the reversal of the transactions by alleged sale of
			<lb />
			securities, it will have to be seen what is the defence of the accused in
			<lb />
			the context of each of those transactions and cross-examination of the
			<lb />
			relevant witnesses examined by the prosecution in support of each
			<lb />
			transaction. I have already stated in brief the defence of each of the
			<lb />
			accused.
			<lb />
			However, now submissions in detail with reference to
			<lb />
			defence for each of the transactions will have to be examined.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			100. In respect of the first transaction, the fo llowing accused have.
			<lb />
			been alleged to be directly involved viz. accused Nos. 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9,
			<lb />
			10 and 11. In respect of the second transaction the accused who have
			<lb />
			been alleged to be involved directly are viz. accused Nos. 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
			<lb />
			and 8 and in respect of third transaction accused Nos.2, 4, 5, 1 and 8
			<lb />
			have been alleged to be directly involved.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			101. In respect of the first transaction, prosecution has examined
			<lb />
			P.W.2, P.W. 6, P.W. 19, P.W. 4, P.W. 9, P.W.1, P.W. 10, P.W. 18 and
			<lb />
			P.W.11.
			<lb />
			In respect of the second transaction prosecution has
			<lb />
			examined P.W.2, P.W.6, P.W.19, P.W.8, P.W.9 and P.W.4. Jn respect
			<lb />
			of the third transaction the prosecution has examined P.W. 1, P.W.6,
			<lb />
			P.W.2, P.W. 19, P.W.4 &amp; P.W.12. In respect of reversal &amp; further
			<lb />
			transaction prosecution has examined P.W.13, P.W.6, P.W.2, P.W.19,
			<lb />
			P.W.8, P.W.6, P.W.17 &amp; P.W.7•
			<lb />
			102. P.W.2 has not been cross-examined by the Counsel for accused
			<lb />
			Nos. 3, 4, 6, 9, 10 and 11. P.W.2, in his cross examination by
			<lb />
			Counsel for accused No.1 has admitted that the entries in the Deal Pad
			<lb />
			are made on the basis of rough sheets and they are made by the dealer
			<lb />
			or by any one to whom the work is assigned by the dealer. He has
			<lb />
			further admitted that during the relevant period, continuous audit of
			<lb />
			funds department was going on and that a note was to be put up to
			<lb />
			the Managing Director through Mr. Narayan Rao, who was the
			<lb />
			Executive Vice President at the relevant time and that the deals
			<lb />
			finalized in the Funds Department were executed at different places at
			<lb />
			Bombay, Delhi and Calcutta. He has further stated that he was not
			<lb />
			aware whether in a purchase transaction, the delivery of the purchase
			<lb />
			was taken by the executing branch. It was further suggested to him
			<lb />
			that the entire amount was recovered by Canfina which suggestion
			<lb />
			was denied by him.
			<lb />
			He has further admitted that the physicals
			<lb />
			register I ledger was meant for showing the actual delivery.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			103. In his cross examination by the Counsel for accused No.2, P.W.2
			<lb />
			has stated that he did not get rough sheet but only Deal Pad was given
			<lb />
			to him and the IBA number was given by the dealer on the Deal Pad
			<lb />
			and, accordingly, entry was made in the IBA Register and that entry at
			<lb />
			Exhi bit-43 in IBA No.2 was in the handwriting of Balasubramaniam ..
			<lb />
			He further admitted that physical register was for showing the holding
			<lb />
			of security and not for the movement of security. He was shown offi ce
			<lb />
			note at Exhi bit-20. He, ho wever, denied having knowledge about the
			<lb />
			contents of office note.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			104. The counse l for accused No.5 cross-examined the P.W.2 and in
			<lb />
			the cross-examination, he has stated that it was his duty to prepare
			<lb />
			cheques on the basis of Deal Pad and he has stated that IBA used to be
			<lb />
			issued only in respect of Canara Bank. The Counsel for accused No.7
			<lb />
			adopted the cross-examination made on behalf of accused No.5. In the
			<lb />
			cross-examination taken by the Counsel for accused No.8, P. W .2 has
			<lb />
			stated that whenever he used to take the cheques to P. Narayan Rao
			<lb />
			and Ashok Kini, they used to check and sign the cheque. He has
			<lb />
			further admitted that the amount of Rs 47,70,68,200/-as shown in
			<lb />
			the document at Exhibit-48 was received by Canfina and that in this
			<lb />
			document there is mention of words &quot;rfr&quot; in the margin, meaning that
			<lb />
			the earlier transaction was reversed. He has stated that the word .. (p)&quot;
			<lb />
			refers to purchase and the word •1(m)11 refers to mutual fund. He has
			<lb />
			also admitted th.at by the Deal Pad Exh.i. b it-48, the earlier five
			<lb />
			transactions of purchase as per Exhibits 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, and 31
			<lb />
			were reversed by receiving the amount of Rs 47,70,68,200/• and that
			<lb />
			a profit of Rs 1,41,68,200/-was earned by Canfina.
			<lb />
			Cross
			<lb />
			examination of P.W.2 was declined by the Counsel appearing on
			<lb />
			behalf of accused Nos. 9, 10 and 11.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			105. From the cross examination of P.W.2, it can be seen that none of
			<lb />
			his testimony has been challenged by the accused and, therefore,
			<lb />
			whatever has been stated by him in his evi dence has practically been
			<lb />
			accepted by the accused. From the cross-examination of P.W.2 it can
			<lb />
			be seen that accused No.1 has tried to put a suggestion that emphasis
			<lb />
			could not be led on deal pad entry in the absence of rough sheets
			<lb />
			being brought on record. In my view, merely because rough sheets
			<lb />
			are not brought on record that does not establish that deal pad entry
			<lb />
			which was made by accused Nos. 1 &amp; 8 was genuine. The fact that
			<lb />
			the deal pad entry is fictitious has been established from the vouchers
			<lb />
			which are prepared by accused Nos. 3 and 11 at the CBMF end. These
			<lb />
			vouchers clearly establish that, according to CBMF, the amount
			<lb />
			amount remitted from Canfina was wrongly received and had to be
			<lb />
			repaid back to Canfina. The amount was credited to the account of
			<lb />
			sundry creditors in CBMF. lf the deal pad entries were genuine, such
			<lb />
			an entry would not have been made in the voucher which was
			<lb />
			prepared by the employees of CBMF. Similarly, cross-examination by
			<lb />
			learned Counsel for accused No.5 and 8 does not help the accused in
			<lb />
			any manner. Even admission of P.W.2 that whenever he used to take
			<lb />
			the cheques to P. Narayan Rao and Ashok Kini, they used to check and
			<lb />
			sign the cheques also does not establish the innocence of accused
			<lb />
			No.8. Reference to the word &quot;rfr&quot; which is found in Exhibit-48 also
			<lb />
			does not make the transaction genuine. As stated hereinabove, the
			<lb />
			vouchers which are prepared by CBMF Officials clearly falsify the
			<lb />
			suggestions made by the Counsel for the accused. The evi dence of
			<lb />
			P.W.2 has not been shaken in the cross-examination.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			106.
			<lb />
			P.W.6 has been cross-examined by accused Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, S
			<lb />
			and 8. Rest of the accused declined to cross-examine him. He has
			<lb />
			been extensively cross-examined by the Counsel for accused No. 1. He
			<lb />
			has admitted that there were number of Officers higher in rank than
			<lb />
			accused No.1 • S. Mohan in Cafina at the relevant time. He, however,
			<lb />
			denied the suggestion that these Officers were responsible for day-to-
			<lb />
			day affairs and management of Canfina. He has stated that each one
			<lb />
			had their own role to play. He has further admitted that office note
			<lb />
			with regard to each and every transaction was used to be put before
			<lb />
			the Managing Director. He has further admitted that there used to be
			<lb />
			concurrent audit in Canfina. He has further admitted that he was not
			<lb />
			shown rough sheets which were written by the dealer when his
			<lb />
			statement was recorded by CBI. �e has denied the suggestion that the
			<lb />
			rough sheets and deal pads used to be put up before him, before he
			<lb />
			signed the cheque. In his cross-examination, he has stated that the
			<lb />
			Sauda Book pertains only to share transactions and other listed NCDs
			<lb />
			purchased through the broker and that he had not stated in his
			<lb />
			statement before CBI that the NCO transactions were also being
			<lb />
			recorded in the Sauda Book. He has further admitted that NCO
			<lb />
			transactions were never written in the Sanda Book and, therefore, did
			<lb />
			not state that before the CBI. He has further admitted that he was
			<lb />
			aware that there was arbitration between Canfina and CBMF. It was
			<lb />
			suggested to him that separate register for ready fo rward transaction
			<lb />
			was maintained in the Dealing Department. He, however, stated that
			<lb />
			he was not aware about it. He has further stated that he was not
			<lb />
			aware whether separate diary was maintained for ready forward
			<lb />
			transactions. No suggestion has been made in respect of statement
			<lb />
			made by him in his examination-in-chief regarding the funds which
			<lb />
			were transferred from Canfina to• CBMF. lt was only suggested that
			<lb />
			rough sheets were initially prepared and then Deal Pad has been
			<lb />
			prepared and that there were higher offi cers than accused No. l who
			<lb />
			were responsible for maintaining day-to-day affairs of Canfina. This
			<lb />
			suggestion was also denied by him. Furth.er, it was suggested that
			<lb />
			other securities were not mentioned in the Sauda Book and he has
			<lb />
			accepted this suggestion that NCO securities were not mentioned in
			<lb />
			the Sauda Book and, therefore, he did not info� the CBI about it.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			107. In the cross examination by the Counsel fo r accused No.2, P.W.6
			<lb />
			has stated that he was the co-signatory alongwith accused No.2 of
			<lb />
			cheques at Exhi bits 27, 29, 31, and 33. He has further admitted that
			<lb />
			for every transaction, there used to be rough sheet and that the
			<lb />
			endorsement &quot;P.E.P&quot; indicated only the entry in the physical register.
			<lb />
			It did not indicate actual receipt of the physicals. No other suggestion
			<lb />
			has been put by the Counsel for accused No.2 to this witne ss.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			108. P.W.6 in his cross-examination by the Counsel for accused No.3
			<lb />
			was asked questions in respect of Exhi bit-41 which was an entry made
			<lb />
			in the IBA issue register. He has stated that this entry was made in
			<lb />
			the IBA Register by accused No.1 -S. Mohan and that he used to
			<lb />
			receive this register alongwi th the cheque for his second signature on
			<lb />
			the cheque.
			<lb />
			He has stated that Exhibit-41 was in respect of
			<lb />
			transaction on account of port fo lio clients and that he was making
			<lb />
			this statement on the basis of Deal Pad at Exhi bit-61 and that the
			<lb />
			dealers working in Funds Department of Canfin.a used to take
			<lb />
			decisions with regard to investments even on behalf of the clients.
			<lb />
			This witness was asked regarding Port Folio Management Scheme and
			<lb />
			he has stated that there were two types of Schemes viz (1) where the
			<lb />
			clients issue instructions in respect of each transaction and (2) where
			<lb />
			the discretion is given to Funds Manager to deal with the funds of the
			<lb />
			clients as the dealer thinks fit. He has stated that the entry at Exhibit-
			<lb />
			41 was in respect of the transaction of the second category. He has
			<lb />
			also admitted that, normally, IBA should contain the details as to
			<lb />
			whom the payment is to be made.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			109. P.W.6 in his cross-examination by Counsel for accused No.4 has
			<lb />
			admitted that there was• arbitration proceedings between Canfina and
			<lb />
			CBMF. He has, however, stated in his cross•examination that he could
			<lb />
			not recall the point of reference to the Arbitration with regard to these
			<lb />
			transactions and whether in respect of the five transactions Canfin.a
			<lb />
			received back money and whether that was the admitte d position.
			<lb />
			before the Arbitrator. He denied the suggestion that he was deposing
			<lb />
			falsely and he could not recollect that Canfina had admitted before
			<lb />
			the Arbitrators th.at they had received the funds in all the five
			<lb />
			transactions.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			110. P. W.6 in his cross-examination by the Counsel for accused No.5
			<lb />
			has admitted that he did not sign any other cheque of Rs 5 crores on
			<lb />
			16/01/1992 and that he was saying so on the basis of JBA Issue
			<lb />
			Register No.II of 16/01/1992. He has further stated that the letter at
			<lb />
			Exhi bitM69 dated 15/04/1993 could not relate to any of the five
			<lb />
			transactions involved in the case. He, however, admitted that the
			<lb />
			Deal Pad at Exhibit-48 covers the transaction. indicated at Exhibit-62.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			111. P. W.6 in his cross examination by Counsel for accused No.8 has
			<lb />
			admitted that entries in IBA Issue Register No. I &amp; II were not in the
			<lb />
			handwriting of accused No.8 -M.K. Ashok Kumar. He has further
			<lb />
			stated that there were three Executive Vice Presidents. He was one of
			<lb />
			them and the other was P.N. Narayanrao . and above them were
			<lb />
			Executive Director and Managing Director and above them was the
			<lb />
			Board of Directors of Canfina and that the Chief Dealer had no power
			<lb />
			to sign the cheques after 1991 and that the notes in respect of all the
			<lb />
			transactions used to be put up to the Managing Director through the
			<lb />
			Back-up Department. He has further admitted that th.ere used to be
			<lb />
			th.re� audits of Canfina viz (1) continuous audit, (2) statutory audit
			<lb />
			and (3) the audit by inspection branch of the Canara Bank. This
			<lb />
			witness was further shown office note dated 08/0 1/1992 addressed
			<lb />
			by the Chief Dealer to Funds Department. He admitted that he had
			<lb />
			signed this document on the right hand side and other signature was
			<lb />
			that of P.N. Narayanrao which is on the left hand side at Exhibit
			<lb />
			A-8(1). After this witness was cross-examined, he was re-examined
			<lb />
			by the prosecution for see.king clarification of the statement wherein
			<lb />
			he has stated that NCD securities were ri.ot mentioned in the Sauda
			<lb />
			Book and in his re-examination he has stated that it was not possible
			<lb />
			to co-relate by mere reference to NCD in. the docume nts as to which
			<lb />
			company they belong. He has further stated that NCD means non-
			<lb />
			convertible debentures and listed NCD means those which are listed
			<lb />
			on the Stock Exchange. After he was shown Deal Pad at Exhibits 62,
			<lb />
			65 and 67, he has stated that there is reference to NCDs but the name
			<lb />
			of the company was not mentioned and, thereafter) he has stated that
			<lb />
			he was not in a position to explain why the NCO transactions were not
			<lb />
			entered in Sauda Book.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			112. In my view, considering the cross-examination of P.W.6 , the
			<lb />
			statement made by him in his examination-in-chief has not been
			<lb />
			shaken by the defence. In the cross-examination by learne d Counsel
			<lb />
			for accused No.1, number of suggestions have been put to P.W.6. The
			<lb />
			first suggestion being there were number of Officers higher in rank
			<lb />
			than accused No.1. The suggestion, therefore , was that the decisions
			<lb />
			were taken by higher-ups and accused No.1 was merely fol lowing
			<lb />
			instructions.
			<lb />
			This suggestion has been denied by the witness by
			<lb />
			saying that they were not responsible for day-to•day affairs and
			<lb />
			management of Canfina. A further suggestion was put that the office
			<lb />
			note regarding these transactions was put up before the Managing
			<lb />
			Director and that the rough sheets wh ich were written by the dealer
			<lb />
			were not shown to him. In his cross-examination by the learned
			<lb />
			Counsel for accused No.l, ini tially he stated that NCD transactions
			<lb />
			were never written in. the Sauda Book. He was, however, re-examined
			<lb />
			by the prosecution and, in the re-examination, he clarified that it was
			<lb />
			not possible to co-relate by mere reference to NCD in the documents
			<lb />
			as to which company they belonged to. He further clarified that in
			<lb />
			deal pad at Exhi bits 62, 65, and 67 there was no reference to the
			<lb />
			name of the Company, though th.ere was reference to NCDs. The
			<lb />
			emphasis by the learned Counsel for the accused was that the theory
			<lb />
			of prosecution that the transactions of purchase and sale of securities
			<lb />
			were entered in Sauda Book was not established. In my view, the
			<lb />
			solitary admission made by this witness that NCDs were not
			<lb />
			mentioned in the Sauda Book does not falsify his earlier evidence that
			<lb />
			all transactions of purchase and sale were entered in the Sauda Book.
			<lb />
			This stray admission given by him in the cross examination stands
			<lb />
			nullified by clarifica tion which has been obtained by the prosecution
			<lb />
			in his re-examination. This suggestion also does not help the case of
			<lb />
			the accused No.1 in any manner. The learned Counsel for accused
			<lb />
			No.3 had made a suggestion to th.is witness which was admitted by
			<lb />
			him stating that normally IBA should contain the detajl.s as to whbm
			<lb />
			the payment is to be made and that the dealers working in the Funds
			<lb />
			Department of Canfina used to take decisions with regard to
			<lb />
			investments even on behalf of the clients. This cross-examination
			<lb />
			does not help the case of accused No.3. It is neither the case of
			<lb />
			prosecution nor it has been suggested by the accused that the alleged
			<lb />
			purchase or sale of securities was pertaining to any particular client
			<lb />
			because, normally, in the case of Portfolio Management Schemes�
			<lb />
			transactions can be entered into by dealers on behalf of such clients.
			<lb />
			It is. nobody&apos;s case that in respect of these transactions, purchase or
			<lb />
			sale was made on behalf of any of the clients. Similarly, a suggestion
			<lb />
			was put by the learned Counsel for accused No.4 that there were
			<lb />
			arbitration proceedings between Canfina and CBMF and that Canfina
			<lb />
			had not made any claim against CBMF in respect of five transactions.
			<lb />
			This suggestion does not help the case of any of the accused. The
			<lb />
			witness, however, has denied this suggestion. The learned Counsel for
			<lb />
			accused No.5 has made a suggestion that this witness had not signe d
			<lb />
			any other cheque of Rs 5 crores on 16/01/1992 but that does not
			<lb />
			establish the case of accused No.5. Prosecution has established that
			<lb />
			the amount was remitted from Canfina to CBMF by creating false and
			<lb />
			fictitious deal pad entries which is further established by the voucher
			<lb />
			which was signed by accused No.4 whe rein he has stated that the
			<lb />
			amount was wrongly remitted by Canfina to CBMF and from CBMF it
			<lb />
			was credited in the account of Hiten P. Dalal in Andhra Bank.
			<lb />
			Similarly, cross•examination by the learned Counsel for accus ed No.8
			<lb />
			also does not establish the innocence of accused No.8, as the
			<lb />
			admission that the en.tries in IBA Issue Re gister 1 and 2 were not in
			<lb />
			the handwriting of accused No.8 does not absolve the said accused
			<lb />
			since he was the Chief Dealer and he had been entrusted with certain
			<lb />
			funds by the Board of Directors and he, alongwith. accused No.1, had
			<lb />
			remitted these amounts to CBMF.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			113. P.W. 1 -Virak thi Hegde has been cross-exam ined by the Counsel
			<lb />
			for accused Nos. 9 and 10, 4 and 11 only. The other accused have
			<lb />
			declined to cross examine this witness.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			114. In her cross examination by Counsel for accused Nos. 9 and 10�
			<lb />
			P.W. 1 has stated about the vouchers being kept in the file serially and
			<lb />
			that it was a box file with.out any specific name and whatever was
			<lb />
			written in the document was under instructions an.d she had no
			<lb />
			personal knowledge about the contents and that apart from
			<lb />
			handwritten documents, entries in these documents were keyed in
			<lb />
			the computer.
			<lb />
			P.W.l in her cross-examination by the Counsel for
			<lb />
			accused No.4 has further state .cl that scoring part on the voucher
			<lb />
			instructions of accused
			<lb />
			141
			<lb />
			No.11 and that the amount which was not pertaining to the scheme,
			<lb />
			would be shown in the account of Sundry Creditors -others and if the
			<lb />
			, amount was wrongly remitted then the amount would be paid back.
			<lb />
			She has stated that the cheques at Exhi. b its-14 and 15 were not signed
			<lb />
			by accused No.4.
			<lb />
			She has further stated in her cross-examination by
			<lb />
			the Counsel for accused No.11 that she did not remember if she had
			<lb />
			atte nded the office on 09/10/1 991 and she never came to know that
			<lb />
			cheques at Exhibits -14 and 15 were written on 09/10/1991. The
			<lb />
			Counsel for accused No.4 further cross-examined this witness and she
			<lb />
			stated that, in the normal course, in the case of wrong remittances
			<lb />
			when a corrective action is taken, signature of Subbarao is not
			<lb />
			necessary but in that particular case his initials were taken on the
			<lb />
			vouchers for approval of the corrective measure. This witness has
			<lb />
			been cross-examined by the Counsel for ac.cused Nos.9, 10, 4 and 11
			<lb />
			only.
			<lb />
			Most of her testimony has not been challenged in cross
			<lb />
			e:xamination.
			<lb />
			In my view, the cross-examination by these accused
			<lb />
			does not in any manner shake her testimony which has been given by
			<lb />
			her in her examination-in-chief.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			115. So far as P.W. 5 -Jarugumilli R. Nath is concerned, accused
			<lb />
			Nos. 1 and 2 and 4 to 11 declined to cross-examine him and only one
			<lb />
			question was asked by the Counsel for accused No.3 to this witness to
			<lb />
			which this witness has replied th.at as far as he knows, prior to his
			<lb />
			joining Canfina, the Managing Director of Canfi.na was sitting in
			<lb />
			Bombay.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			116.
			<lb />
			So far as P.W. 9 -Ravi Tirumalai is concerned, his cross
			<lb />
			examination on behalf of accused Nos. 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 was
			<lb />
			declined. Counsel for accused No.3 asked this witness about hierarchy
			<lb />
			of CBMF and the accounts maintained by each Fund. P.W. 9 has
			<lb />
			fur ther stated that CBMF did not have Articles of Association since it
			<lb />
			was not ind ependently registered Company. He has also stated that
			<lb />
			he was not aware as to what were the powers delegated to the
			<lb />
			General Manager.
			<lb />
			He has further stated th.at except his bare words,
			<lb />
			there was no evidence to show that the cheque of Rs 12 crores was
			<lb />
			issued on the instructions of accused No. 3 • Mr. Acharya, the General
			<lb />
			Manager and he has stated that there were no guidelines regarding
			<lb />
			the manner in which wrong credits were to be dealt with.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			117. In his cross examination by the Counsel for accused No.4, P.W.9
			<lb />
			has stated that accused No.4 was also over seeing the accounts and
			<lb />
			looking after the administrative work of CBMF and he was not
			<lb />
			concerned with any deals I transactions with the broke rs. He has also
			<lb />
			admitted th.at the accused No.4 was not concerned with call money
			<lb />
			transactions of purchase and sale of securities and equities. He was
			<lb />
			asked a specific question in respect of voucher dated 22/1 0/1991 at
			<lb />
			Exhibit-102 and whether he had any discussion with regard to this
			<lb />
			voucher with accused No.4 to which he has replied that the cheque
			<lb />
			came into their bankers in High Value Clearing and, at that time, their
			<lb />
			account did not have sufficient amount to honour the cheque.
			<lb />
			However, accused No. 3 -B.R. Acharya was not in Office and,
			<lb />
			therefore, he discussed with accused No.4 -Subbarao as to what
			<lb />
			should be done and he has stated that accused No.4 was not aware of
			<lb />
			the transaction and, therefore, accused No.4 told him that he should
			<lb />
			inquire about it and let him know and after a lapse of one hour,
			<lb />
			accused No.4 gave him IBA number and that he told him that this IBA
			<lb />
			number was given to him by Mr. Acharya -accused No.3.
			<lb />
			This
			<lb />
			witness was cross-examined by the Counsel for accused No.S and in
			<lb />
			his cross-examination he was shown voucher at Exhibit-106 and he
			<lb />
			has admitted that in the credit portion of this voucher, earlier, Canfina
			<lb />
			Bangalore was writte n. However, it was scored and Banke rs Account -
			<lb />
			T;L. was written. &quot;IBA No.11 was also written and scored. Earlier
			<lb />
			writing,, however, was not visible and it was also scored out. He was
			<lb />
			also shown the cheque at Exhibit-51 for Rs 5 crores . He has admitted
			<lb />
			that it was signed by Mr. Anil Narachinia and Mr. Satish and it was in
			<lb />
			favour of Canara Bank and not in favour of Hiten Dalal as indicated in
			<lb />
			credit portion of voucher at Exhi bit-106. He also admitted that while
			<lb />
			signing the voucher, he did not ask any details regarding this
			<lb />
			transaction.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			118. P.W. 18 -Mukesh K. Joshi has not been cross-examined by
			<lb />
			accused No.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 11.
			<lb />
			P.W. 18 in his cross-
			<lb />
			examination by the Counsel for accused No.6 has stated th.at their
			<lb />
			Firm had transaction with S. K. Jhaveri -accused No.6. and they were
			<lb />
			maintaining his account in their Firm. When he was shown cheque at
			<lb />
			Exhibit• 112, he was unable to say with which transaction it was
			<lb />
			concemed. No other suggestion has been put to him by the Counsel
			<lb />
			for accused No.6. P.W. 18 in his cross examination by Counsel for
			<lb />
			accused Nos. 9 and 10 has stated that he used to maintain the carbon
			<lb />
			copy of cheque issued on behalf of the Firm. His attention was drawn
			<lb />
			to the carbon copy No. 5 77597. He has stated that the handwriting
			<lb />
			on the carbon copy was of Nitin Patel and that there was narr ation as
			<lb />
			115,00,000 REL 2,00,000 NH and 3,00,000 AS.KNP&quot; and, after this
			<lb />
			endorsement, there are initials of Navinchandra Parekh -accused
			<lb />
			No.10. He has stated that this endorsement means that the cheque
			<lb />
			was issued for purchase of 5,00,000 shares of Reliance and the letters
			<lb />
			&apos;&apos;NH11 means Narbehram Harakchand. He was unable to state the long
			<lb />
			form of 11KNP11 • However, he was aware of one person by name
			<lb />
			Kirtikumar Narbheram Parekh. On being shown Exhi bit-111 -pay-in
			<lb />
			slip,. he has stated that he used to write the narration of transaction on
			<lb />
			the reverse of the counter-foil. The writing on front and reverse of
			<lb />
			this was in his handwriting and on the reverse of the counter-foil
			<lb />
			there was narration of &quot;500000 Reliance&quot; besides the figures of two
			<lb />
			cheques and also there was writing as &quot;CB-42&quot;. He has stated that it
			<lb />
			was a ledger folio number and &quot;CB&quot; stands for Canara Bank. The cross
			<lb />
			examination of this witne ss does not in any manner affect the
			<lb />
			testimony which he has given in his examination-in-chief. Though in
			<lb />
			his cross-examination he has stated that accused Nos. 9 and 10
			<lb />
			maintained a carbon copy of the cheque issued on behalf of the firm
			<lb />
			and that there was a narr ation of &quot;500,000 REL, 2,00,000 NH and
			<lb />
			3,00,000 AS.KNP11 this statement of P.W.18 in his cross-examination
			<lb />
			does not establish or even create a doubt that the transaction dated
			<lb />
			10/10/1991 was a genuine transaction.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			119.
			<lb />
			So far as P.W. 10 is concerned, the learned Counsel appearing
			<lb />
			on behalf of accused Nos. 1 to 8 and 11 have not cross-examined him.
			<lb />
			The only cross-examination was by the learned Counsel appearing on
			<lb />
			behalf of accused Nos. 9 and 10. In the cross-examination, he has
			<lb />
			stated that before 1990, he was not aware whe ther the account of
			<lb />
			Narbheram Harakchand was in existence. He has stated that it was
			<lb />
			part of his duty to verify the signatures appearing on the cheque
			<lb />
			received by their bank for clearance and he could identify the
			<lb />
			signature of accused No.10 on Cheque • Exhibit 112. He has stated
			<lb />
			that he was not aware whether he was shown statement of account
			<lb />
			when his statement was recorded by CBI. The cross examination,
			<lb />
			therefore, does not in., any way, further the case of the accused Nos. 9
			<lb />
			and 10.
			<lb />
			120. P.W. 11 • Kishore Ajgaonkar was working in Stock Exchange
			<lb />
			Branch of Bank of India. The cross-examination of this witness is
			<lb />
			declined by accused Nos.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 &amp; 10 and 11. He was
			<lb />
			cross-examined only by the Counsel for accused No.6. In his cross
			<lb />
			examination, he has stated after perusing the Statement of Account at
			<lb />
			Exhi bit-115 of S.K. Jhaveri that the entry dated 10/10/1991 for Rs_
			<lb />
			3,30,000,00/-was the credit entry showing that the amount was.
			<lb />
			credited to his account on that day. He has admitted that on the same
			<lb />
			day the amount of Rs 4.19 crores was credited to S.I&lt;. Jhaveri&apos;s
			<lb />
			account. He has also admitted that on 11/10/1991, there were two
			<lb />
			entries; one for Rs 30,35,00,900/• and another for Rs S crores.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			121. P.W. 19 has been cross-examined by the Counsel for all the
			<lb />
			accused.
			<lb />

			122. Apart from this evidence the accused No.6 has examined one
			<lb />
			witness Nishit Rasiklal Joshi • DW A-6(1). He was working as an
			<lb />
			Accountant with Shrenikbhai Jhaveri • accused No.6. Accused No.7
			<lb />
			has examined one witness Surendran Nair -DW A-7(1) who was
			<lb />
			work ing
			<lb />
			in the Administrative Department of Nahar Group of
			<lb />
			Companies. Accused No. 9 also has examined one witness Manish
			<lb />
			Mahendra Thakkar -DW A-9(1).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			123. Thus, this is the entire evidence which is brought on record in
			<lb />
			respect of the first transaction, both, by the prosecution and by the
			<lb />
			accused. Perusal of this evidence discloses that the prosecution has
			<lb />
			established beyond the reasonable doubt by producing necessary
			<lb />
			documents that the amount of Rs 17.29 crores was remitted from
			<lb />
			Canfina to CBMF and from CBMF to the Account of accused Nos. 9 -
			<lb />
			Ke tan V. Parekh and accused No.10 -Navinchandra N. Parekh and in
			<lb />
			respect of amounts of Rs 8.30 crores and Rs 8.99 crores in favo ur of
			<lb />
			accused No.6 -S.K Jh.ave ri and accused No.7 -Pallav Seth in their
			<lb />
			Joint Account in the Bank of America. There is no cross-examination
			<lb />
			on the point of documents which show the remittance of the said
			<lb />
			amount from Canfina to CBMF and from CBMF to the brokers viz
			<lb />
			accused No.6, accused No.7 and accused Nos. 9 and 10. Prosecution
			<lb />
			has also established that Canf ina did not receive physical securities at
			<lb />
			the time when the said amount of Rs 17.29 crores was remitted to
			<lb />
			CBMF and fa lse entries were created in order to show that the
			<lb />
			transaction was entered into with Canfina for purchase of securities,
			<lb />
			though, in fact, no transaction was taken place. Though an attempt
			<lb />
			has been made on behalf of the accused to show that, in fact, the said
			<lb />
			transaction had taken place, there is no evidence to show that on the
			<lb />
			date on which the amount was remitted, security in physical form or
			<lb />
			Bank Receipt was obtained as security by the Officers of Canfina.
			<lb />
			Merely because the amount which was remitted in the five
			<lb />
			transactions was received back at subsequent stage, does not absolve
			<lb />
			the accused who have ta.ken part in the remittance of the amount. A
			<lb />
			refund of this amount, therefore, does not absolve the Officials of the
			<lb />
			Canfina or brokers who received the said amount and utilized the
			<lb />
			same for their own purpose.
			<lb />
			It has been established from the
			<lb />
			State ment of Account of accused Nos. 6 and 7 and accused Nos. 9 &amp;
			<lb />
			10 that the amount which was received by them was utilized for their
			<lb />
			own purposes, which has been established by number of cheques
			<lb />
			which have been issued by th.em from their Account.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			documentary evidence which is brought on record clearly establishes
			<lb />
			the commission of the said offence by the accused. There is virtually
			<lb />
			no cross-examination in respect of the actual remittance of the
			<lb />
			amount and in respect of correctness of the entries which have • been
			<lb />
			made as also documents in respect of cheques, pay-in-slips,
			<lb />
			Statements of Account of Canfina and CBMF and individual Accounts
			<lb />
			of accused Nos. 6 and 7 and accused Nos. 9 and 10. This evidence
			<lb />
			establishes involvement of accused Nos. 1 and 8 from Canfina,
			<lb />
			accused No.3 from CBMF, accused Nos. 6 and 7 and accused Nos. 9
			<lb />
			and 10 who were stock brokers.
			<lb />
			In my view, prosecution has
			<lb />
			established charge of criminal misappropriation under section 403,
			<lb />
			criminal breach of trust under section 409 and criminal conspiracy
			<lb />
			under section 120-B against the accused Nos. 1 and 8, 3 and 11 and
			<lb />
			accused Nos. 6, 7, 9 and 1 O. Though an attempt has been made to
			<lb />
			show that, in fact, there
			<lb />
			was
			<lb />
			actual
			<lb />
			transaction of purchase
			<lb />
			and sale of securities by showing certain endorsements, the defence of
			<lb />
			accused Nos. 6 and 7 and 9 and 10 cannot be accepted. lt is no doubt
			<lb />
			true that witness of Canfina has stated that Canfina earned profit of
			<lb />
			about Rs 1 crores but the fact remains that a huge amount of Rs 17.29
			<lb />
			crores was debited without there being any physical security or
			<lb />
			collateral security and thus the offence of temporary misappropriation
			<lb />
			has been committed by accused Nos. 1 and 8, 3 and accused Nos. 6,
			<lb />
			7, 9 and 10. So far as accused No.2 is conce rned, in my view, the
			<lb />
			prosecution has not been in a position to establish that he was a part
			<lb />
			of the criminal conspiracy or that he had committed an overt act in
			<lb />
			respect of the actual remittance of the said amount from Canfina.
			<lb />
			Accused No.2 was working in the Back-up Department and, as such,
			<lb />
			accused Nos. 1 and 8 were dealers who were authorized to enter into
			<lb />
			deals in respect of purchase and sale of securities and on the basis of
			<lb />
			instructions given by these two accused, the accused No.2 was asked
			<lb />
			to make entries.
			<lb />
			DEFENCE OF INDIVIDUAL ACC USED
			<lb />
			AND THEIR SUBMISSONS :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			124. Now the defence of individual accused and their submissions
			<lb />
			will be taken into consideration.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			First transaction date d 10.10. 1991 in resoect
			<lb />
			of pmchase of Rn. for Rs. lZ.29. gore s
			<lb />
			from CBMF:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			125.
			<lb />
			The learned Counsel for accused No.1 -S. Mohan has
			<lb />
			submitted that there was no conclusive proof to show that accused
			<lb />
			No.1 had entered into such transaction. In my view, evidence of
			<lb />
			P.W.2, P.W.6, P.W.1, P.W. 9 and P.W.10 clearly establishes the role
			<lb />
			played by accused No.1. The allegation of prosecution again.st
			<lb />
			accused No.1 is that he did not have any authority, yet, he and
			<lb />
			accused No.8 were responsible for remitting the amount of Rs 17 .29
			<lb />
			crores in this transaction. The submission of the learned Counsel for
			<lb />
			accused No.1 that the entries made in the Deal Pad and IBA Register
			<lb />
			are to be treated as ministerial acts, cannot be accepted. It was the
			<lb />
			duty of accused No.1 to have ascertained whe ther the amount which
			<lb />
			was being remitted was authorized by higher Officials of Canfina and
			<lb />
			or there was proper security obtained before remitting the said
			<lb />
			&apos;
			<lb />
			amount and, therefore, merely stating th.at he had done the ministerial
			<lb />
			act will not absolve him from the commission of this offence, though
			<lb />
			there may not be any evidence to show that, in fact, accused No.1 had
			<lb />
			entered into any of the subject transactions of this case. Prosecution,
			<lb />
			having established the overt act committed by accused No.1, has
			<lb />
			proved th.at there was enough material to show that accused No.1 is a
			<lb />
			-:&quot;, &quot;!!&amp; :;
			<lb />
			152
			<lb />
			part of the conspiracy of siphoning of the funds from Canfina by
			<lb />
			creating fictitious record. The accused No.1 was responsible for
			<lb />
			cre ating this record.
			<lb />
			The involvement of accused No.1 is more
			<lb />
			serious, particularly because he, admittedly, had no power to enter
			<lb />
			into these transactions. That being the position, it was always open
			<lb />
			for the accused No.1 to have asked for the proper security before
			<lb />
			entering into transaction or he should have obtained sanction from
			<lb />
			the higher authorities for the said transaction. This, admittedly, was
			<lb />
			not done by accused No .1. Merely because acc used No.1 was working
			<lb />
			under accused No.8, does not absolve him from the commission of
			<lb />
			offe nce. The evidence which is brought on record by the prosecution
			<lb />
			clearly discloses that this amount of Rs. 17.29 crores could not have
			<lb />
			been remitted by accused No.8 alone without the actual help and
			<lb />
			connivance of accused No.1. The first submission, therefore, of the
			<lb />
			learned Counsel appearing on behalf of accused no.1 cannot be
			<lb />
			accepted. There is virtually no cross-examination of th.is witness by
			<lb />
			the Counsel appearing on behalf of accused No. l. The only attempt
			<lb />
			has been made to establish that highe r-ups were aware of the
			<lb />
			transaction as the notes were being put up before the Board of
			<lb />
			Directors and Vice President. An attempt has been made by the
			<lb />
			accused No.1 to show that higher-up were not made accused and that
			<lb />
			the accused No. l was comparatively a lower ranking Officer. Merely
			<lb />
			because the prosecution has not filed any charges against the other
			<lb />
			high ranking officers, that by itself does not take the acts committed
			<lb />
			by accused No.1 out of the purview of the offe nce punishable under
			<lb />
			the provisions of the Indian Penal Code. The second submission made
			<lb />
			by the learned Counsel for accu sed No.1 is that the rough sheet is the
			<lb />
			foremost and primary record of deals and that this evidence not
			<lb />
			having. been brought on record, the prosecution has not established
			<lb />
			the case in respect of remittance of Rs 17.29 c:rores. This submission
			<lb />
			also cannot be accepted. Though P.W. 2 in his evidence has stated
			<lb />
			that entries in the Deal Pad were made on the basis of rough sheets
			<lb />
			and that the rough sheets are not brought on record by the
			<lb />
			prosecution does not further the case of accused No.1. The Deal Pad
			<lb />
			entries have been proved by the prosecution. The remittance of R.s
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			17.29 crores also has been proved by the prosecution and, therefore,
			<lb />
			merely because rough sheets are not brought on record, it cannot be
			<lb />
			said that the case of the prosecution has not been established. The
			<lb />
			third submission of the learned Counsel for accused No.1 is that the
			<lb />
			entries in the Deal Pad and IBA Register are not relevant for deciding
			<lb />
			the person who concluded the deal.
			<lb />
			The learned Counsel has
			<lb />
			submitted that no witness has stated that the person who made entries
			<lb />
			in the records/registers is the person who concluded the deal. He has
			<lb />
			submitted that the witnesses have only identified the person who
			<lb />
			made entries in the Deal Pad/JBA Registe r and nothing beyond that.
			<lb />
			He submitted that P.W.2 has merely identified the handwriting of
			<lb />
			accused No.1 in the Deal Pad dated 10/10/1991 at Exhibit-59 and
			<lb />
			also IBA Register at Exhi bit-39 and Exhibit-40 and th.at P.W. 6 also has
			<lb />
			identified the handwriting of accused No.1 at Exhibit-59 and in the
			<lb />
			IBA register, at Exhibit-41. He submitted that P.W.2 had also some
			<lb />
			times prepared the Deal Pad based on rough sheet. P.W. 6 has also
			<lb />
			stated that the Back-up Department would note all these deals in the
			<lb />
			Deal Pad.
			<lb />
			He fu rther submitted that P.W. 2 has stated that he was
			<lb />
			maintaining the IBA Register and the stock of the security register and
			<lb />
			he was also making entry in the IBA Register on the bas� of Deal Pad.
			<lb />
			These submissions made by the learned Counsel for accused No.l
			<lb />
			cannot be accepted. The fact remains th.at the relevant entry in the
			<lb />
			Deal Pad concerned with the remittance of Rs 17.29 crores was made
			<lb />
			by accused No.l and his handwriting has been recognized by P.W.2
			<lb />
			and P.W.6. This fact has not been denied by accused No.1 either by
			<lb />
			putting a suggestion in the cross-examination or otherwise
			<lb />
			establishing that the entry was not made by accused No.1. It is
			<lb />
			further submitted by the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of
			<lb />
			accused No.l that the deals in question were reversed with profit and
			<lb />
			that Canfina had earned profit of Rs 1,41,68,200/-. This also, by itself,
			<lb />
			as stated hereinabove, does not make the transaction clear. Canfina
			<lb />
			is 1000/o subsidiary of Canara Bank which is a nationalized bank and,
			<lb />
			as such, money which was remitte d from Canfina was public money
			<lb />
			and, therefore, the amount could not have been paid without there
			<lb />
			being proper security in the form of physical security or atleast in the
			<lb />
			form of Bank Receipt (BR). There is nothing on record to show that
			<lb />
			any such security was obtained before re mitting the said amount. The
			<lb />
			fact that the amount was returned back may be one of the mi tigating
			<lb />
			factors which will have to be taken into consideration while
			<lb />
			considering the seriousness of the offence and while awarding the
			<lb />
			sentence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			126.
			<lb />
			The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of accused No.1
			<lb />
			also submitted that the investigation carried out by the Officer of CBI
			<lb />
			i.e. P.W. 19 was perfunctory and not proper. He submitted that rough
			<lb />
			sheets were not seized.
			<lb />
			He further submitted that P.W. 19 has
			<lb />
			admitted that he did not recollect whether he had seized the office
			<lb />
			note put. up to the Managing Director or whether he had seized RF
			<lb />
			diary from the Back-up Department, the ready fo rward note book
			<lb />
			from dealing department, the vouchers in respect of these transactions
			<lb />
			from the Back-up Department of Canfina and that though the
			<lb />
			prosecution own witnesses have stated about these documents, the
			<lb />
			Investigating Officer did not recollect having seized these documents.
			<lb />
			He submitted that the Investigating Officer did not record the
			<lb />
			statement of Mr. K.B. Shenoi and Mr. Satish Shetty of Canfina. In
			<lb />
			support of this submission, he invited my attention to the evidence of
			<lb />
			P.W.19 in para 18. He further submitted that the prosecution did not
			<lb />
			examine the relevant witnesses whose statements were already
			<lb />
			recorded by CBI viz. Mr. Praveen Bhat, Mr. P.N. Narayan Rao and Mr.
			<lb />
			A.P. Rao . He submitted that, therefore, adverse inference was liable
			<lb />
			to be drawn against the prosecution.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the
			<lb />
			prosecution has produced the evidence which has suited to it and has
			<lb />
			not taken charge of I produced best evidence available so that the true
			<lb />
			picture about the transactions in question could have been brought
			<lb />
			before this Court. Jt is lastly submitted that there was no direct or
			<lb />
			circumstantial evidence to establish the criminal conspiracy.
			<lb />
			In
			<lb />
			support of this submission, he relied upon number of judgments of the
			<lb />
			High Courts and Apex Court.
			<lb />
			None of these submissions can be
			<lb />
			accepted. Merely because rough sheets have not been produced, does
			<lb />
			not establish that the entries made in the Deal Pad were not correct.
			<lb />
			Prosecution has established the chain of circumstances right from the
			<lb />
			Deal Pad entry till the remittance of the amount through IBA, which
			<lb />
			was conveyed on telephone and the remittance of the amount on the
			<lb />
			same day to CBMF and from CBMF to brokers viz. accused Nos. 6, 7, 9
			<lb />
			and 10. Prosecution has established this pattern which clearly
			<lb />
			establishes that accused Nos. 1 and 8, 3 and accused Nos. 6, 7, 9 and
			<lb />
			10 were aware th.at the said amount was likely to be received on the
			<lb />
			same day i.e. 10/10/1991 and, the refore, though there was no
			<lb />
			amount in the CBMF, remittances were made in fa vour of accused
			<lb />
			Nos. 6, 7, 9 and 10. The chain of circumstances, therefore, has been
			<lb />
			completely established by the prosecution, clearly po�ting out
			<lb />
			towards the guilt of the accused viz. accused Nos. 1 and 8, 3 and 6
			<lb />
			and 7 and 9 and 10 so far as this particular transaction is conce rned.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			127.
			<lb />
			So far as accused No.2 -N. Balasubramaniam is concerned,
			<lb />
			submissions made by his Counsel will have to be accepted and, in my
			<lb />
			view, it cannot be held that the accused No.2 is involved in any of the
			<lb />
			offences with which he is charge d in the instant case. The admitted
			<lb />
			position is that he was working in the Back-up Department to record
			<lb />
			the transactions put through by the dealers. He was reporting to the
			<lb />
			Vi ce Pre sident Mr. K.B. Shenoi who is not made an accused in this case
			<lb />
			by the prosecution. The prosecution witness has stated that his job
			<lb />
			was to write down the transaction put through by the Dealing
			<lb />
			Department in the Deal Pad based on the instructions give n by the
			<lb />
			dealers in the rough sheets. He did not have any power to buy or sell
			<lb />
			or deal in shares or securities. It has come on record in evidence that
			<lb />
			he has not concluded or entered into any deal at any time. The
			<lb />
			evidence which has come on record indicates th.at the accused No.2
			<lb />
			merely was given a job of recording the transactions, procedure of
			<lb />
			purchase and sale transaction which is undertaken and it has come on
			<lb />
			record through evid ence of P.W.2 and P.W. 6 which indicates that the
			<lb />
			decision is taken by the dealers and the instructions are given to the
			<lb />
			execution centers which are noted down by the dealers in rough
			<lb />
			sheets. Funds are transferred by conveying IBAs. Then, the IBAs are
			<lb />
			mentioned in IBA Register. Thereafter, cheques are issued to the Bank
			<lb />
			for debiting the account and actual IBAs. The rough sheets are the n
			<lb />
			given to Back-up Department for noting the transactions in the Deal
			<lb />
			Pad, copy of the Deal Pad is taken by the Back-up Department for
			<lb />
			further accounting and Deal Pad is given back to the dealers. Thus, in
			<lb />
			no way, the accused No.2 who was working in the Back-up
			<lb />
			Department was concerned with the actual decisions regarding
			<lb />
			purchase or sale of shares.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			128.
			<lb />
			So far as the cheques are concerned, initially, the cheques
			<lb />
			were signed by one official. Latter on, the cheques were signed jointly
			<lb />
			by any two officials viz. Ashok Kumar Kini, K.B. Shenoi, P.N. Narayan
			<lb />
			Rao and accused N o.2. It has to be noted here that the cheques in this
			<lb />
			transaction appear to have been signed as a mere formality since the
			<lb />
			transactions had already been carried out and the funds were
			<lb />
			transferred by the dealers by conveying IBA numbers. In view of this
			<lb />
			evidence which is on record, accused No.2 cannot be said to be a
			<lb />
			member of the criminal conspiracy as he was acting under the Vice
			<lb />
			President Mr. K.B. Shenoi who also has not been made as an accused.
			<lb />
			Similarly, other persons, who have signed the cheques also are not
			<lb />
			made as accused. On the same analogy, therefore, it cannot be said
			<lb />
			that accused No.2 was a co-conspirator who had taken part in
			<lb />
			remitting the money illegally from Canfina. The accused No.2 is,
			<lb />
			therefore acquitted of all the allegations and charges which are
			<lb />
			levelled against him.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			129.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that accused No.3 -B.R. Acharya was not
			<lb />
			having mens rea and was not involved in conspiracy with any of the
			<lb />
			accused as alleged by the CBI. Secondly, it is submitted that the
			<lb />
			160
			<lb />
			ingredient &quot;dishonestly misappropriates&quot; as is fo und in section 403
			<lb />
			and 405, has not been established by the prosecution particularly in
			<lb />
			view of the def initions under section 23, 24 and 25 of the lndian Penal
			<lb />
			Code .
			<lb />
			He has submitted that the amount which was allegedly
			<lb />
			remitted from CBMF to the brokers was returned to Canfina with a
			<lb />
			profit of more than Rs 1 crore. It is submitted that the contents of the
			<lb />
			vouchers and other documents have not been proved and, therefore,
			<lb />
			no case was made out by CBI since only signatures have been proved
			<lb />
			and not the contents. lt is submitted that the offence under section
			<lb />
			403 has not been proved since the evidence on record shows that
			<lb />
			there was no dishonest intention and the alleged property had not
			<lb />
			been used for his own wrongful gain or his institution i.e. CBMF and,
			<lb />
			therefore, it is submitted that the ingre dient of section 403 regarding
			<lb />
			&quot;dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use any movable
			<lb />
			property&quot; is not satisfied.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that after the amount was
			<lb />
			received by CBMF, it was immediately transferre d to Mr. S.I&lt;. Jhaveri
			<lb />
			and M/s Narbheram Harakhcha nd and it was not retained by th�
			<lb />
			accused No.3 in the account of CBMF and, therefore, there was no
			<lb />
			intention or Mens rea in respect of offence under section 403 and,
			<lb />
			therefore, there was no question of abetment as contemplated under
			<lb />
			section 109. It is then submitted that the money was transferred to
			<lb />
			161
			<lb />
			another person and, thus, the nature of transaction was between two
			<lb />
			persons and, therefore, CBI had no Locus standi to fi le a complaint. It
			<lb />
			is then submitted that the offence under section 405 also is not made
			<lb />
			out. It is also submitted that the offence under the provisions of
			<lb />
			sections 409, 467, 463, 471, 477-A have also not been established.
			<lb />
			All these submissions cannot be accepted. The accus ed No.3 was the
			<lb />
			co-conspirator and without his connivance and assistance, money
			<lb />
			could not have been siphoned off to the brokers.
			<lb />
			He instructed
			<lb />
			accused No.11 to transfer the money in favour of the brokers which
			<lb />
			was done by accused No.11 at his instance. Merely because the said
			<lb />
			amount was returned back to Canfin� does not absolve the accused
			<lb />
			No.3 of his responsibility and liability on account of temporary
			<lb />
			misappropriation. In my view, it is very much established by the
			<lb />
			prosecution that the accused No.3 was a co-conspirator and, therefore,
			<lb />
			once that is established for the actions of his other co-conspirators he
			<lb />
			is also equally liable. The offence with which he is charged, therefore,
			<lb />
			has been clearly established beyond the reasonable doubt.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			130.
			<lb />
			So far as accused No.4 -P.J. Subbarao is concerned, the
			<lb />
			submissions made by the learned Counsel appearing on his behalf will
			<lb />
			have to be accepted. From the evidence of P.W.16 and P.W.9 it is
			<lb />
			evident that accused No.4 was handling administration as well as
			<lb />
			accounts and, therefore, he had powers to pass the accounting
			<lb />
			vouchers, credit &amp; debit vouchers and the accused No.4, as can be
			<lb />
			seen from the evidence of P.W.9, was overs eeing the accoun�s and
			<lb />
			looking after admi.n.istrative work of CBMF and he was not concerned
			<lb />
			with the deals/transactions with the brokers and he was al.so not
			<lb />
			concerned with call money transactions or transactions of sale and
			<lb />
			purchase of securities and equities. Further, from the evidence of
			<lb />
			P.W.1 also, it can be seen that his initials were taken on the vouchers
			<lb />
			for approval of corrective measures. In respect of transaction dated
			<lb />
			16/1/1992, voucher at Exhibit-106 has not been signed by accused
			<lb />
			No.4. Then, the cheque at Exhib it-51 is also not signed by accused
			<lb />
			No.4. Thus, from the entire evidence, the prosecution has not been
			<lb />
			able to establish that the accused No.4 was connected in any way with
			<lb />
			the criminal conspiracy of siphoning off funds from Canfina to CBMF
			<lb />
			and from CBMF to the brokers -accused. It has been established from
			<lb />
			the statements of witnesses that he was not concerned with the actual
			<lb />
			deals/transactions and he was only looking after the administrative
			<lb />
			work. Prosecution, therefore, has not established the case against
			<lb />
			accused No.4 in respect of any other transactions.
			<lb />
		</p>

			So far as accused No.6 -S.K. Jhaveri is concerned, the
			<lb />
			learned Counsel appearing on his behalf has submitted that there is no
			<lb />
			evidence regarding conspiracy and that the statements of witnesses
			<lb />
			prove innoce nce of accused No.6. He has relied on the statement of
			<lb />
			P.W.9 -Ravi Tirumalai, who has stated that he personally did not
			<lb />
			know the accused No.6 and the said witness had prepared a cheque
			<lb />
			for Rs 12 crores in favour of accused No.6. It is submitted that the
			<lb />
			offence of conspiracy and criminal breach of trust cannot be sustained
			<lb />
			against accused No.6. He has further submitted that the said witness
			<lb />
			had stated that CBMF was dealing with Pallav Seth, the representative
			<lb />
			of accused No.6 and that this supported the case of accused No.6 that
			<lb />
			all dealings with Canara Bank and its Associates like CBMF, Canfina
			<lb />
			etc were done only by Pallav Seth -accused No. 7 and that the accused
			<lb />
			No.6 has no personal knowledge and is not involved in the same. The
			<lb />
			learned Counsel further relied on the statements of the witness
			<lb />
			wherein he has stated that he has never informed the accused No.6
			<lb />
			that the cheque for a sum of Rs 12 crores was issued as per the
			<lb />
			instructions of Canfina, Bangalore .
			<lb />
			Further, he relied on the
			<lb />
			statements of P.W. 19 -Investigating Officer, who confirmed that the
			<lb />
			cheque dated 10/10/1991 for Rs 8.99 crores was handed over to
			<lb />
			Pallav Seth -accused No.7 being the representative of S.K. Jhaveri -
			<lb />
			accused No.6. It is then submitted th.at the accused No.6 had already
			<lb />
			informed the Investigating Officer by reply dated 18/07 /1994 that the
			<lb />
			accused No.6 had regular transactions with Canara bank and the
			<lb />
			cheque in question was part of such regular transactions in normal
			<lb />
			course of business. He further invited my attention to the cross
			<lb />
			examination of P.W.19 wherein he has admitted that he did not make
			<lb />
			any inquiry with Canara Bank as to whether accused No.6 had any
			<lb />
			trans action other than the transaction which was the subject matter
			<lb />
			of the special case. He invited my attention to the further evidence of
			<lb />
			P.W.19, which, accord ing to the learned Counsel, established that
			<lb />
			none of the documents relied upon by the prosecution showed that
			<lb />
			the accused No.6 was involved either in criminal conspiracy or in
			<lb />
			dive rsion.
			<lb />
			It is then submitted that the motive attri buted by the
			<lb />
			prosecution to accused No.6 was that the amount was siphoned off in
			<lb />
			order to utilize the sai d money. ln support of the said submission, the
			<lb />
			learned Counsel appearing on behalf of accused No.6 relied on the
			<lb />
			statement of account of Bank of India of accused No.6 for the relevant
			<lb />
			period. He • submitted on the basis of the said opening and closing
			<lb />
			balance of the said account that though pay-in-day of Stock Exchange
			<lb />
			was 10th October, 1991, Stock Exchange never used to deposit
			<lb />
			cheques of brokers on the same day and they would be deposited
			<lb />
			after about two days of pay-in-day to enable the brokers to get
			<lb />
			sufficient balance in their account by depositing the cheques collected
			<lb />
			from clients in respect of settlement cheques. It is, therefore, argued
			<lb />
			that, in the present case, the Stock Exchange deposited accused No.6&apos;s
			<lb />
			cheque only on 11/10/1991. Further, the learned Counsel pointed
			<lb />
			out that the amount allegedly received by accused No.6 was not
			<lb />
			utilized for the purpose of making payment to the creditors of accused
			<lb />
			No.6. It is further submitted that there was no evidence to show that
			<lb />
			the cheque which was issued by accused No.6 was without
			<lb />
			consideration. Jt was therefore submitted in short that there was no
			<lb />
			oral and documentary evidence adduced by the prosecution to prove
			<lb />
			that : (a) the accused No.6 had any role to play in the alleged
			<lb />
			conspiracy; (b) the accused No.6 had any knowledge that the moneys
			<lb />
			received from Canara Bank/CBMF were not against any consideration;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(c) the accused No.6 induced Canara Bank/Canfina to issue the said
			<lb />
			cheques; (d) the cheques were without consideration; (e) there was
			<lb />
			any deficiency in accused No.6&apos;s account on 11/10/1 991 when the
			<lb />
			cheque was deposited by Stock Exchange (f) the accused No.6 was in
			<lb />
			any way involved in diversion of moneys from Canfina to CBMF, (g)
			<lb />
			the accuse d No.6 had misappropriated the amount.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			132. The said submissions made by the learned Counsel appearing on
			<lb />
			behalf of accused No.6 cannot be accepted. It has already been held
			<lb />
			that the charge of criminal conspiracy has been proved against
			<lb />
			accused Nos. 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. The alleged charge of criminal
			<lb />
			conspiracy having been proved,
			<lb />
			the accused No. 6 not having any
			<lb />
			knowledge in respect of other transactions is immaterial. Prosecution
			<lb />
			having established that the accused No.6 was a part of the general
			<lb />
			conspiracy and the prosecution having established the flow of money
			<lb />
			from Canfina to CBMF and from CBMF to Bank Account of accused
			<lb />
			No.6 and utilization of the said amount by accused No.6, it is clear
			<lb />
			that the accused No.6 had misappropriated the amount and this was
			<lb />
			done by virtue of the fictitious entries which were made by accused
			<lb />
			Nos. 1, 8 &amp; 3. Though accused No.6 may have other transactions
			<lb />
			with Canfina or Canara Bank or CBMF, yet, the fact remains that these
			<lb />
			transactions were fi ctitious transactions and, therefore, charge of
			<lb />
			temporary misappropriation has been clearly established.
			<lb />
			Cross-examination of DW A-6(1) -Ni-shit Rasildal Joshi:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			133. The accused No.6 has examined his witne ss DW A-6(1) -Nishit
			<lb />
			Rasiklal Doshi. He has stated that in 1991 he was working as an
			<lb />
			Accountant with Shrenikbhai Jhaveri -accused No.6. He has stated in
			<lb />
			his evidence that he used to look after the accounts and make entries
			<lb />
			from Bank counter-foils and cheque book and cheque counter foils to
			<lb />
			the bank book and from the bank book to the ledger account of the
			<lb />
			respective clients. He has stated that Pallav Sheth was the sub-broker
			<lb />
			of accused No.6. He has further stated that Pallav Sheth used to
			<lb />
			collect orders from his own clients, execute them and receive cheques
			<lb />
			from and issue cheques to respective clients and that Shrenik Jhaveri
			<lb />
			had six sub-brokers besides Pallave Sheth. He has further stated that
			<lb />
			Canara Bank and Canban.k Mutual Fund were the clients of Pallav
			<lb />
			Sheth. He has stated that all transactions in respect of CBMF were
			<lb />
			maintained in the account of Canara Bank and that there were
			<lb />
			hundreds of transactions with Canara Bank and/or Canbank Mutual
			<lb />
			Fund in the year 1991-92. He further stated that during the period
			<lb />
			1991-92 around 170 cheques were received from Canara Bank
			<lb />
			aggregating to Rs 200 to 210 crores and around 120 cheques were
			<lb />
			issued during t:hi5 year aggregating to Rs. 110 to 115 crores. He has
			<lb />
			further stated that the ledger book was maintained in respect of the
			<lb />
			transaction of Pallav Sheth with his clients. Various entries in Book
			<lb />
			No.1, 2 and 3 were brought on record through this witness.
			<lb />
			Essentially, the defence of accused No.6, apart from denial, is that
			<lb />
			accused No. 7 was his sub-broker and he was directly dealing with the
			<lb />
			Canara Bank and CBMF and he (accused No.6) had no connection of
			<lb />
			what.soever with the transaction is question and the amount which
			<lb />
			was received was, in fact, deposited in the Joint Account and,
			<lb />
			therefore, he had not received any amount from CBMF or Canfina and
			<lb />
			it was accused No.7 who could be held responsible for the transaction
			<lb />
			and not accused No.6.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			134.
			<lb />
			Jn my view, the said defence and evi dence of his
			<lb />
			accountant does not help accused No.6. Jt is possible that there may
			<lb />
			be number of transactions during the relevant period between
			<lb />
			Canfina, Canara Bank and S.K. Jhaveri -accused No.6. However, the
			<lb />
			fact remaips that, that does not by itself make the aforesaid two
			<lb />
			transactions legal.
			<lb />
			lt is possible that accused No.6 might have
			<lb />
			received hundreds of crores from Canara Bank, CBMF in respect of
			<lb />
			other transactions during the course of the year and that the said
			<lb />
			transactions may be valid transactions. The fact remains that, in the
			<lb />
			present case, the prosecution has established that huge amounts were
			<lb />
			siphoned off and particularly those mentioned in the aforesaid
			<lb />
			transactions dated 10/10/1991 etc. which were fictitious transactions
			<lb />
			and the deal pad entries were created only to give an impression that
			<lb />
			those securities were purchased, whe� in fact, the record indicates
			<lb />
			that no such transactions had ever taken place. Secondly, once it is
			<lb />
			held that there was a conspiracy to siphon off the funds, • it is
			<lb />
			immaterial whether accused No.7 was sub-broke r of accused No.6 or
			<lb />
			that accused No.6 did not have any direct dealings with Bank Officers
			<lb />
			or that the amount was deposited in the Joint Account of accused Nos.
			<lb />
			6 and 7. The fact re.mains that the amount was deposited in his
			<lb />
			account and it was utilized by him, though the said amount did not
			<lb />
			belong to him. Therefore, this witness does not take the case of
			<lb />
			accused No.6 any further and does not establish his innocence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			135.
			<lb />
			So far as accused No.7 -Pallav Seth is concerned� he was
			<lb />
			the representative of accused No.6 and, therefore charge against
			<lb />
			accused No.7 also has been established from the oral and
			<lb />
			documentary evidence which has been brought on record.
			<lb />
			Cross-examination of DW A-7(1) -Surendran Nair :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			136.
			<lb />
			Accused No.7 -Pallav Seth has examined DW A-7(1)
			<lb />
			Surendran Nair.
			<lb />
			This witness was working in the Administrative
			<lb />
			Department of Nahar Group of Companies. He has stated that he was
			<lb />
			working in Mumbai Office and that the Share Department was
			<lb />
			situated at Ludhiana. He has produced Share Transfer Register for the
			<lb />
			month of March, 1992. He has stated that as per this Register, the
			<lb />
			folio number of Canara Bank was C00674 and the entries at serial
			<lb />
			Nos.27273 to 28170 were concerning the transfer of shares to Canara
			<lb />
			Bank and that, as per the said entries, various shares have been
			<lb />
			transferred from various transferors to Canara Bank on 25/03/1992
			<lb />
			and the total number of shares transferred to Canara Bank on
			<lb />
			25/03/1992 were 85000. In the cross-examination, he has stated that
			<lb />
			he was seeing the register for the first time and that he had no
			<lb />
			personal knowledge about this register. Hence, it appears that this
			<lb />
			witness is of no assistance to accused No. 7.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			137.
			<lb />
			So far as accused No.8 -M.K. Ashok Kumar is concerned,
			<lb />
			he was the Chief Dealer of Canfina and he had instructed accused
			<lb />
			No.1 to make deal pad entries. Therefore, merely because accused
			<lb />
			No.8 may not have put his signatures on certain documents could not
			<lb />
			absolve him from the comm1ss1on of the said offence.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			submissions made by the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of
			<lb />
			accused No.8, therefore, cannot be accepted.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			138.
			<lb />
			It has been estab lished by the prosecution that the part of
			<lb />
			the money, initially, had gone to accused No. 9 -Ketan V. Parekh &amp;
			<lb />
			accused No. 10 -Navinchandra N. Parekh who had, in tum, retained
			<lb />
			the amount of Rs 5 lakhs and remitted the amount of Rs 8.25 crores to
			<lb />
			accused No.6.
			<lb />
			Prosecution has established that the amount was
			<lb />
			deposited in their account and, on the very same day, that amount
			<lb />
			was remitted to accused No.6. The submission made by the learned
			<lb />
			Counsel for accused Nos. 9 and 10 that they had already given reply
			<lb />
			regarding the transaction to the Investigating Officer and that shows
			<lb />
			the genuineness of the transaction, cannot be accepted. Once it has
			<lb />
			been established that the prosecution has proved the charge of general
			<lb />
			cr iminal conspiracy and has established the flow of the amount on the
			<lb />
			basis of creation of fictitious record, merely because reply has been
			<lb />
			given by accused Nos. 9 and 10 to the Inves tigating Officer does not
			<lb />
			establish that it was a genuine transaction. The question of drawing
			<lb />
			adverse inference for not examining D&apos;souza and also relevant
			<lb />
			witnes ses also does not arise since it is a well settled position in law
			<lb />
			that the prosecution can examine some witnesses and if the sufficient
			<lb />
			evi dence is brought •on record it may drop examination of certain
			<lb />
			witnesses and, in the present case, merely because some witnesses
			<lb />
			whose statements have been record ed, have not been examined
			<lb />
			cannot be held against the prosecution.
			<lb />
			Cross-examination of D. W .A ..:9( 1) -Manish Mahendra Thakkar :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			139.
			<lb />
			Accused No.9 has examined DW A-9(1) -Mr. Manish
			<lb />
			Manendra Thakkar. This witness has stated that he was working with
			<lb />
			Mis Nerbheram Harakchand and he was handling the institutions
			<lb />
			business and his work was to deliver contracts and shares. He was
			<lb />
			shown two contract notes dated 27/09/1991 issued in favour of
			<lb />
			Canara Bank. He has stated that original contract notes were with
			<lb />
			Canara Bank and that he had delivered those originals to Mr. B.R.
			<lb />
			Acharya -accused No.3. He has further stated that accused No.3 had
			<lb />
			put his initials by way of acknowledgment on both these contract
			<lb />
			notes and they were signed by accused No.9 -Ketan V. Parekh. He
			<lb />
			has also stated that from the delivery book of the firm K.N. Parekh, it
			<lb />
			could be seen that there was delivery of 2,79,800 shares of
			<lb />
			Re liance Industries to Canbank and delivery of those shares was made
			<lb />
			on 13/10/1991. He has stated th.at the delivery was made to Mr.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			D&apos;Souza, the Custodial Manager of Canbank Mutual Fund and he
			<lb />
			asked him to meet Mr. B.R. Acharya since he did not know about
			<lb />
			these shares.
			<lb />
			He has stated that Mr. B.R. Acharya accepted the
			<lb />
			delivery of the shares as also the first and second copy of the delivery
			<lb />
			challan. He has stated that the firm did not receive the second copy of
			<lb />
			the acknowle dgment.
			<lb />
			Further, he has stated that the register
			<lb />
			indicated that there was delivery of 2,00,000 shares of Reliance
			<lb />
			Industries to Nerbheram Harakchand and delivery of shares was made
			<lb />
			by him to Mr. D&apos;Souza of Canbank Mutual Fund on 13/10/1991. In
			<lb />
			the cross-examination, he has stated that Mr. D&apos;Souza was working as
			<lb />
			Custodial Manager and he had met him many ti.mes regarding delivery
			<lb />
			of shares to him and also had obtained his initials as acknowle dgment.
			<lb />
			He has stated that the contract note was issued to a party who has
			<lb />
			instructed the firm to buy or sell shares in their name. He has
			<lb />
			admitted that in the documents at Exhib its-A-9 and 10 the name of
			<lb />
			Canbank Mutual Fund was not mentioned.
			<lb />
			However, he has
			<lb />
			volunteered to say that whenever they had transactions with CBMF,
			<lb />
			they used to be shown in their record in the name of Canara Bank.
			<lb />
			Much emphasis was laid on the suggestion made by the prosecution to
			<lb />
			this witness to the effect that the person by name Mr. D&apos;Souza was
			<lb />
			never working with Canban.k Mutual Fund.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			140.
			<lb />
			It is vehemently submitted that it was the duty of the
			<lb />
			prosecution to bring out the correct facts before the Court. lt is
			<lb />
			submitted th.at it was brought on record by the prosecution witnesses
			<lb />
			the mselves that Mr. D&apos;Souza was a Custodial Manager and he was the
			<lb />
			head of their Department.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that, therefore, the
			<lb />
			suggestion which was put to this witness in cross-examination
			<lb />
			suggests th.at the prosecution has tried to suppress the material facts
			<lb />
			from the Court and has purposely not examined Mr. DtSouza and,
			<lb />
			therefore, adverse inference was liable to b� drawn against the
			<lb />
			prosecution.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			141.
			<lb />
			ln my view, the evidence of this witness does not assist
			<lb />
			either accused No.9 or 10. As stated by me earlier that it is possible
			<lb />
			that there might be number of genuine transactions which were
			<lb />
			•
			<lb />
			entered into by CB:MF with these brokers and from time to time
			<lb />
			delivery of the shares was made to Canara Bank which was accepted
			<lb />
			by Mr. D&apos;Souza or any other officials. This, however, does not make
			<lb />
			the aforesaid three transactions legal and valid.
			<lb />
			It has been
			<lb />
			established by the prosecution that these transactions were fictitious
			<lb />
			transactions and that the money was utilized illegally by the brokers
			<lb />
			after it was siphoned off from Canfina to CBMF. This defence witness
			<lb />
			[DW-A-9(1)] therefore does not help the accused No.9.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			142.
			<lb />
			So far as accused No.11 -B.V. Srinivasan is concerned, he
			<lb />
			was merely a junior ranking officer who was acting on the instructions
			<lb />
			of accused No.3 -B.R. Acharya. From the evi dence which has come
			<lb />
			on record, it is clear that he had no other alternative but to accept the
			<lb />
			directions which were given by accused No.3. In my view, therefore,
			<lb />
			the charge against accused No.11 has not been established.
			<lb />
			Second transaction dated 22/1 0/1991
			<lb />
			in respect of purchase o f 14% NCDs for
			<lb />
			Rs 12 crores (rom C8MF :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			143.
			<lb />
			So far as this transaction is concerned, already the
			<lb />
			evidence which has come on record has been discussed at length. The
			<lb />
			oral and
			<lb />
			the documentary evi dence on record has also been
			<lb />
			considered. The evidence of P.W.2, P.W.6, P.W.4, P.W.9, P.W. 19,
			<lb />
			P. W.8 conclusively establishes fl.ow of funds from Canfina at the
			<lb />
			behest of accused Nos. 1 and 8, false entries being made in the Deal
			<lb />
			Pad at Exhi bit-61 in respect of IBA No. 32151. At Exhibit-60, Sauda
			<lb />
			Book discloses that no entry has been made in respect of Deal Pad at
			<lb />
			E:xhibit-61 whereas entry is made in lBA Issue Register at Exhi bit-41.
			<lb />
			The entry is in the handwriting of accused No.1.
			<lb />
			The Canfina,
			<lb />
			Bangalore has an account with Canbank. in Bangalore. The cheque at
			<lb />
			E:xhi bit-25 vi de cheque No.013453 was issued in the name of
			<lb />
			&quot;Yourselves IBA on Tamarind Lane, Bombay&quot; and the amount was
			<lb />
			transferred to Bombay. The Statement of Current Account at Exhi bit-
			<lb />
			162 discloses that the amount was passed from Canfina to CBMF.
			<lb />
			Exhi bit-26 is a credit slip of Canbank, Bangalore Branch. This was
			<lb />
			done by IBA from Bangalore. The actual IBA was received afte r 3 to 4
			<lb />
			days. Since the amount was deposited in Canbank, Tamarind Lane,
			<lb />
			the cheque at Exhibit-78 was issued in favour of accused No.6 -S.K.
			<lb />
			Jhaveri and the cheque number was mentioned in voucher at Exh.ibit-
			<lb />
			102. The amount was deposited in joint account of accused No.6 -
			<lb />
			S.K. Jhaveri and accused No. 7 -Pallav Seth with the Bank of America.
			<lb />
			Pay-in-slip at Exhibit 79 shows that the amount was credited and
			<lb />
			Exhi bits-80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85 disclose that the amount is utilized by
			<lb />
			177
			<lb />
			accused No.6 on 22/10/1991. Prosecution, therefore, in my view, has
			<lb />
			clearly established the conspiracy as against accused Nos. 1, 8, 3, 6, 7,
			<lb />
			9 and 10. I have already discussed at length the reason why I fe el that
			<lb />
			there is sufficient material to disclose the criminal conspiracy for
			<lb />
			siphoning off funds. For the same reasons, in my view, conside ring
			<lb />
			the oral and documentary evidence on record, the case against the
			<lb />
			said accused Nos. 1, 8, 3, 6, 7, 9 and 10 has been established so far as
			<lb />
			this transaction is concerned.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			144. In respect of the second transaction dated 22/10/1991, the
			<lb />
			prosecution has examined P.W.2, 6, 19, 4, 9 and 8
			<lb />
			In respect of
			<lb />
			P.W.2, P.W.6 and P.W. 19 and P.W.9, I have already discussed the
			<lb />
			cross-examination while dealing wit h the first transaction. Since the
			<lb />
			cross-examination of these wimess has already been discussed, it is no
			<lb />
			longer necessary again to separately deal with the cross examination
			<lb />
			of these witnesses. So far as remaining witnesses viz. P.W.4 &amp; P.W.8
			<lb />
			are concerned, P.W.4 has not been cross-examined by any of the
			<lb />
			accused and P.W. 8 also has not been cross-examined by accused Nos.
			<lb />
			1 to 6 &amp; 8 to 11. P.W. 8 has been cross-examined only by the learned
			<lb />
			Counsel for accused No. 7.
			<lb />
			In cross examination, P.W. 8 was shown
			<lb />
			Exhibit-76 which was a cheque issued in favour of BOA.
			<lb />
			He has
			<lb />
			further stated in cross-exmination that whenever a cheque was issued
			<lb />
			in favour of a person, it is credited to the account of that person only.
			<lb />
			He has further stated that the statement of account entry at Exhibit-
			<lb />
			38/1 does not indicate the cheque number.
			<lb />
			The evidence of this
			<lb />
			witness is not shattered, in any way, by the learned Counse l for
			<lb />
			accused No. 7
			<lb />
			Third transaction dated 16/0 1/1992
			<lb />
			in respe ct of 14% NCDs &amp;om .CBMF
			<lb />
			for Rs 5 crores:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			145.
			<lb />
			In respect of this transaction also the amount involved is
			<lb />
			Rs 5 crores. The Deal Pad is at Exhi bit-62. The Sauda Book is at
			<lb />
			Exhi bits-63 and 64. Exhibit-42 is the IBA Issue Register. Exhi bit-27 is
			<lb />
			a cheque for Rs 5 crores. Exhibit-162 is the Statement of Current
			<lb />
			Account. Exhi bit-28 is the Telegraphic Transfer Form. Exhibit-107 is
			<lb />
			the letter disclosing IBA number. Exhib it-106 is the voucher. Exhi bit-
			<lb />
			51 is the cheque. Exhibit 52 is the requisition letter of a Canara Bank
			<lb />
			to issue banker&apos;s cheque in favour of Hiten P. Dalal. Exhibit-121 is the
			<lb />
			credit voucher of Andhra Bank. Exhi bit 120(1) is the credit entry in
			<lb />
			respect of cheque at Exhibit-51.
			<lb />
			Exhi bit 120(5) is the balance of
			<lb />
			credit entries in respect of opening and closing balance. Exhibit-122
			<lb />
			is the cheque issued by And.bra Bank in favo ur of Corporation Bank
			<lb />
			which is signed by Hiten P. Dalal. The accused who were involved in
			<lb />
			this are accused Nos. 2, 4 and 5. In this case also, in my view, the
			<lb />
			prosecution has established the actual siphoning off funds from
			<lb />
			Canfina to CBMF and from CBMF to Hiten P. Dalal -accused No.5.
			<lb />
			The Statement of Account of Hiten P. Dalal discloses that the amount
			<lb />
			has been utilized by him. The oral and documentary evidence on
			<lb />
			record clearly establishes the siphoning off of funds by preparing false
			<lb />
			entries in the Deal Pad. The submission of Mr. Kale, the learned
			<lb />
			Counsel appearing on behalf of accused No.5 that the amount of Rs 5
			<lb />
			crores which was paid by Hiten P. Dalal to Corporation B� was in
			<lb />
			respect of adjustment of the account cannot be accepte d. What is to
			<lb />
			be seen is whether the amount was siphoned off from Canfina to
			<lb />
			CBMF and from CBMF to the account of Hiten P. Dalal. This has been
			<lb />
			established by the documentary and oral evidence which is adduced
			<lb />
			by the prosecution. Once that is established, it clearly indicates that
			<lb />
			the funds were diverted ostensibly for purchase of securities, when, in
			<lb />
			fact, no such securities were purchased. It is possible that accused
			<lb />
			No.5 -Hiten P. Dalal might have given an explanation to the
			<lb />
			Investigation Officer but that by itself does not absolve the
			<lb />
			involve ment of accused No.5 in the commission of the said offence
			<lb />
			and the mere fact that the amount was returned back also does not
			<lb />
			reduce the liability of accused No. 5. Therefore, at the Canfina&apos;s end,
			<lb />
			accused Nos. 1 &amp; 8 were responsible for siphoning off of the amount
			<lb />
			to• CBMF from which end the accused No.3 siphoned off the money to
			<lb />
			Hiten P. Dalal who utilized it and, thereafter, returned it illegally back
			<lb />
			to Canfina.
			<lb />
			Thus, therefore, the case of conspiracy has been
			<lb />
			established. Charge No.1 has been established against accused No.5.
			<lb />
			Similarly, the charge of temporary misappropriation also has been
			<lb />
			established as also the charge of abetment of criminal breach of trust
			<lb />
			by accused No.5 has been established.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			146. In respect of the third transaction dated 16/01/1992, the
			<lb />
			prosecution has examined P.W.l, 6, 2, 19, 4 and 12. I have discussed
			<lb />
			the cross-examination of P.W.l, P.W.2, P.W.6, P.W.19 and P.W.4 while
			<lb />
			considering the first transaction and , therefore, it is not necessary to
			<lb />
			again restate their cross•examination while considering the third
			<lb />
			transaction. So far as P.W. 12 is concerned, he has been cross-
			<lb />
			examined by the learned Counsel for accused No.5. This witness was
			<lb />
			shown cheque dated 16/01/1992 -Exhibit-51 being cheque
			<lb />
			No.58/664. He was also shown a Credit Voucher -Exhibit-121. He
			<lb />
			�•
			<lb />
			has stated that in this voucher although there is a mention of R.s 5
			<lb />
			crores and Rs 1,52,55,290/-the cheque Numbers are different i.e.
			<lb />
			992040 and 202837 which do not tally with cheque at Exhibit-51. He
			<lb />
			has stated as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;This means that the voucher Ex. 121
			<lb />
			does not relate to the cheuqe Ex. 51.&quot;
			<lb />
			He has further stated that the closing balance of the previous day was
			<lb />
			the opening balance of the next day. His attention was drawn to the
			<lb />
			statement of account Exhi bit-120. He has stated that the closing
			<lb />
			balance was Rs 2,24,70,386.12. He was also shown memo from
			<lb />
			Canara Bank dated 16/01/1992. He has stated that this refers to the
			<lb />
			said cheque of Rs 5 crores as mentioned in the credit voucher at
			<lb />
			Exhibit-121. The memo was taken on record as Exhibit A-5 (1). By
			<lb />
			this cross-examination, what is suggested and argued by Mr. Kale, the
			<lb />
			learned Counsel appearing on behalf of accused No.5 that the cheque
			<lb />
			at Exhibit-51 was issued in favo ur of yourself and that the cheque
			<lb />
			numb er of Exhibit-51 and cheque number in the Credit Voucher at
			<lb />
			Exhi bit-121 are different and, therefore, there was no evidence to
			<lb />
			show that the amount which was remitted by Canf ina to CBMF was
			<lb />
			fur ther remitted to accused No.5. It is no doubt true that the cheque
			<lb />
			number which is shown at Credit Voucher -Exhibit-121 is 992040
			<lb />
			dated 16/01/1992 and the cheque number at Exhi bit-51 is 587664
			<lb />
			and th.at there is a difference in the cheque number as shown in
			<lb />
			Exhi bit-121 and Exhi bit-51. Even if it is assumed that the cheque at
			<lb />
			Exhi bit 51 was, in fact, issued in the name of yourself, the fact remains
			<lb />
			that the amount of Rs 5 crores was remitted from CBMF to the account
			<lb />
			of accused No. 5 -Hiten P. Dalal. In my view, variation of cheque
			<lb />
			number of Canara Bank at Exhibit-51 and Pay Order by which the
			<lb />
			amount was credited to the Andhra Bank in Hiten P. Dalars account
			<lb />
			does not assist the accused.
			<lb />
			The relevant voucher at Exhibit-121
			<lb />
			clearly shows that CBMF deposited the money through their cheque
			<lb />
			with Canara Bank, who, in turn, issued a cheque of different number
			<lb />
			as per :instructions of CBMF favouring accused No.S&apos;s account in
			<lb />
			Andhra Bank which is at Exhi bit-119 and Exhi bit•52. Exhibit-119 is a
			<lb />
			letter written by the Chief Officer, Andhra Bank to the Superintendent
			<lb />
			of Police. In the said letter it is mentioned that the cheque No. 587664
			<lb />
			which is a cheque at Exhi bit•Sl for Rs 5 crores was issued by Canbank
			<lb />
			Mutual Fund on their CD a/c.3914 with Canara Bank and this was not
			<lb />
			a bankers&apos; pay order. He has further stated that Andhra Bank has
			<lb />
			received pay order No.992040 dated 16/01/1992 from Canara Bank
			<lb />
			with a covering letter to credit the amount to H.P. Dalal&apos;s account and
			<lb />
			the xerox copy of the relevant letter was also enclos ed. The emphasis
			<lb />
			laid by Mr. Kale, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of accused
			<lb />
			No.5 on the variation in the cheque number at Exhi bit-51 and at
			<lb />
			Exhibit-121, therefore, does not change the complexion of the case.
			<lb />
			The fact remains that it has been established by the prosecution that
			<lb />
			the amount of Rs 5 crores was deposited in the account of Hiten P.
			<lb />
			Dalal. What accused No.5 has done in this case is immaterial. An
			<lb />
			attempt has been made to show that the said amount of Rs 5 crores
			<lb />
			was paid by him to the Corporation Bank for the purpose of
			<lb />
			adjustment. In my view, once it is established that all the accused
			<lb />
			were part of the same conspiracy for siphoning off the funds and it is
			<lb />
			established that the funds were deposited in the account of accused
			<lb />
			No.5, it cannot be said that accused No.5 was not involved either in
			<lb />
			conspiracy or in misappropriation of the amount for his own use.

			Fourth transaction dated OZ/0211992 _in
			<lb />
			resoe ct of 17% NC Ds from CBMF f o r .Rs .5 aores:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			147.
			<lb />
			The beneficiary of this transaction was Manubhai
			<lb />
			Maniklal. Prosecution has not pressed the charges in respect of this
			<lb />
			transaction since the beneficiary in this transaction has expired and
			<lb />
			the case against him has abated. Hence, it is not necessary to discuss
			<lb />
			the evidence in respect of this transaction.
			<lb />
			F ifth transacti on dated 11/02/19 92 in
			<lb />
			reso e d: of 14% NCDs from CBMF for
			<lb />
			Rs. 7 gores :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			148.
			<lb />
			Though the prosecution has led oral and documentary
			<lb />
			evi dence in respect of this transaction, at the time of oral arguments
			<lb />
			Mr. V.G. Pradhan, the learned Special Public Prosecutor appearing on
			<lb />
			behalf of CBI did not press the charges in respect of this transaction
			<lb />
			since the beneficiary of this transaction viz. Manubhai Maniklal has
			<lb />
			expire d. Hence, it is not necessary to discuss the evidence in respect
			<lb />
			of this transaction.
			<lb />
			Further Diversion &amp; Reversal:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			149.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			I have already discussed at length the evidence which has
			<lb />
			been led by the prosecution.
			<lb />
			I have already noted that the
			<lb />
			prosecution has established that the amount which was siphoned off
			<lb />
			from Canfina was reverted back to it in an illegal manner. This
			<lb />
			evidence clearly discloses that there was no regular transaction in
			<lb />
			respect of purchase of so-called NCD securities nor sale of these
			<lb />
			securities and that the money had been illegally siphoned off and it
			<lb />
			was temporary misappropriation by the brokers who utilized the
			<lb />
			money for their own purposes and latter on remitted the money back
			<lb />
			through accused Nos. 6 and 7. Prosecution has established the
			<lb />
			reversal of the transaction by bringing on record documentary
			<lb />
			evi dence in the form of Deal Pad Entry at Exhibit-48, IBA at Exhi bit-
			<lb />
			70, the relevant entry at Exhibit-45, Deal Pad at Exhibits-46 &amp; 47, the
			<lb />
			cheque at Exhi bit-33, Statement of Current Account at Exhibit-162,
			<lb />
			credit slip at Exhibit-34, the cheque at Exhibit-76 issued favoring Bank
			<lb />
			of America, Pay-in-slip at Exhibit-77, Statement of Account at Exhibit-
			<lb />
			38, Sauda Book at Exhibit-60. The amount which was brought back
			<lb />
			through V.B. Desai -broker on behalf of accused No.7 is at Exhi bit-
			<lb />
			124. Exhi bit-70 discloses that sale of securities was false and there
			<lb />
			was, in fa ct, no transaction. It is no doubt true that the prosecution
			<lb />
			witness has admitted in the cross-examination that Canfina earned
			<lb />
			profit of more than Rs 1 crore in respect of the said transaction.
			<lb />
			However, merely because the amount was returned back, does not
			<lb />
			establish the innocence of the accused. That may be a fa ctor which
			<lb />
			may be taken into consideration at the time of awarding sentence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			150.
			<lb />
			It is stre nuously urged on behalf of the accused that th.ere
			<lb />
			was no dishonest intention and that the refund of the amount clearly
			<lb />
			discloses that the accused never wanted to misappropriate the said
			<lb />
			amount and that the sai d transaction was a regular transaction in
			<lb />
			respect of purchase and sale of securi ties. This has been the consistent
			<lb />
			theme of the Counsel appearing on behalf of the accused. It has also
			<lb />
			been argued that the accused had already given explanation in respect
			<lb />
			of the transaction when notice was issued to them by the Investigating
			<lb />
			Officer under section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code and that it
			<lb />
			was a duty of the Investigating Officer to have verified the sai d
			<lb />
			explanation by making inquiry with the Canara Bank and CBMF and
			<lb />
			the I.O. fa iling to do so, the case against the accused had not been
			<lb />
			established beyond the reasonable doubt. It is also argued that it is
			<lb />
			the duty of the prosecution to place relevant material before the Court
			<lb />
			so that the Court can give its finding whe ther the accused are guilty or
			<lb />
			not of the alleged charges which are leve lled against the accused. It is
			<lb />
			also strenuously urged that adverse inference was liable to be drawn
			<lb />
			against the prosecution for non-examination of the important
			<lb />
			witnesses. It is also urged that some of the persons who were named
			<lb />
			as accused were late r on dropped and no explanation has been given
			<lb />
			by the prosecution as to why these accused were not being
			<lb />
			prosecuted. All these submissions have already been considered in
			<lb />
			respect of other transactions and for the same reasons, the said
			<lb />
			submissions cannot be accepted. The important factor which has to
			<lb />
			be considered is . that in respect of these transactions the material on
			<lb />
			record clearly discloses that (a) there was no real or genume
			<lb />
			transaction of either purchase or sale of securities, (b) entries were
			<lb />
			made in the Deal Pad and other vouchers to create an imp ression that,
			<lb />
			in fact, there was a purchase of sale of securities, when, in fact, there
			<lb />
			was no such transaction, (c) CBMF was used as a conduit to siphon off
			<lb />
			the amount. On the one hand it was shown as if the amount was
			<lb />
			wrongly received from Canfi.na to CBMF and that amount which was
			<lb />
			wrongly received was to be repaid back &amp; at the same time, this
			<lb />
			amount was siphoned off to the brokers who utilized it for the ir own
			<lb />
			purposes. The accused Nos. 6 and 7 received almost about Rs 24
			<lb />
			crores and these two accused received the maximum benefit. The
			<lb />
			accused Nos. 9 and 10 also were used as conduit to transfer the funds
			<lb />
			from CBMF to accused Nos. 6 &amp; 7 and they retained the amount of Rs
			<lb />
			5 lakhs and remitted Rs 8.25 crores to the account of accused Nos. 6
			<lb />
			&amp; 7. The accused No.5 received Rs 5 crore s. This amount was
			<lb />
			remitted bct ck by accused No.7. Though an attempt was made to
			<lb />
			show that, in fact, the amount was received from purchase of
			<lb />
			securities such as 11RlL11 by showing the counter-foil and the notings on
			<lb />
			the counter-foil, that does not establish that, in fact, these securities
			<lb />
			were either purchased or sold. Canfina itself is a Company whi ch was
			<lb />
			authorized to buy and sale securities and, therefore, there was no
			<lb />
			reason to buy or sell these securities through CBMF. It is brought on
			<lb />
			record that CBMF was not dealing either in purchase or sale of
			<lb />
			securities on behalf of Canfina. If at all Canf ina wante d to buy or sell
			<lb />
			securities, it could have done so directly through brokers. For all
			<lb />
			these reasons, therefore, the submissions made on behalf of the
			<lb />
			accused cannot be accepted.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			151. In respect of the reversal of the transaction, prosecution has
			<lb />
			examined P.W.13, P.W.6, P.W.2, P.W. 19, P.W.8, P.W.6, P.W.17 and
			<lb />
			P.W.7. I have already considered the cross-examination of P.W.6,
			<lb />
			P.W.2, P.W.1 9, P.W.8 and P.W.6 while considering the first
			<lb />
			transaction. So far as the remaining three witnesse s viz. P.W. 13,
			<lb />
			P.W. 17 and P.W.7 are concerned, none of the Counsel for accused has
			<lb />
			cross-examined P.W.13 Omprakash Kuckian.
			<lb />
			Th.is witness was
			<lb />
			examined for the purpose of proving reversal of the transaction and he
			<lb />
			has stated that he used to maintain Register No.VJ and that the entries
			<lb />
			were made in the Register on the basis of the documents like purchase
			<lb />
			or sale memo and that he had made an entry of Rs 53, 77 ,82,500/
			<lb />
			which was in his handwriting and this was in respect of the cheque
			<lb />
			received from V.B. Desai. He has also state d that in this entry there
			<lb />
			was no reference to the nature of transaction i.e. whether it was a
			<lb />
			purchase or sale transaction. The entry has been exhibited at Exhibit-
			<lb />
			124. He has stated that the amount mentioned in the entry was
			<lb />
			transferred to Bangalore under the JBA No.F/214/92. Thus this
			<lb />
			evidence has not been challenged which indicates that the reversal has
			<lb />
			been made though there was no purchase or sale transaction entered
			<lb />
			into by any of the brokers or by the dealers of Canfina. P.W. 17 also
			<lb />
			has been cross-examined by the learned Counsel for accused No.7.
			<lb />
			P.W. 17 -Yogesh Bhambardekar was working with Bombay Stock
			<lb />
			Exchange and he has stated that he maintained the quotation for the
			<lb />
			month of March, 1992 &amp; April 1992. The learned Counsel for accused
			<lb />
			No.7 has cros s-examined this witness and in cross-examination he has
			<lb />
			stated that if the quotation is received &apos;&apos;X Right&quot; then it is so recorded
			<lb />
			and if the quotation is with. &apos;&apos;X Right&quot; then &quot;XR&quot; is written, otherwise
			<lb />
			the quotation is inclusive of right. He has denied the suggestion that
			<lb />
			the quotations recorded on 25/03/1992 are X Right. He was shown
			<lb />
			quotation dated 21/02/1992. He has stated that the quotation was in
			<lb />
			respect of Nahar Spinning and on that day the quotations were 800-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			850. The quotation has been exhi bited at Exhibit A-7(1). He has
			<lb />
			further stated that on the earlier day i.e. on 20/02/1992 the quotation
			<lb />
			of Nahar Spinning was 1400-1600. The said page was also bro ught
			<lb />
			on record at Exhibit A-7(2) and the relevant entry is at Exhibit-
			<lb />
			A-7(2) (A) ( 1). In my view, the cros s-examination of this witness does
			<lb />
			not change his original testimony as given by him in his examination-
			<lb />
			in-chief.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			152.
			<lb />
			Now, I would like to consider whether accused Nos.l, 2, 3,
			<lb />
			4, 8 and 11 are public servants within the meaning of section 21 of
			<lb />
			the Indian Penal code and whether the provisions of Prevention of
			<lb />
			Corruption Act are attracted in their case and, secondly, whether the
			<lb />
			sanction to prosecute was properly granted by the sanctioning
			<lb />
			authority in respect of the accused who were in service at the time
			<lb />
			when the charge-sheet was filed.
			<lb />
			WhetbeJ the sanction accorded to prgsecute ac cus e d Nos. 2 &amp; 4 is
			<lb />
			proper and vali d Md whether accused Nos . 1. 2. 3. 4. 8 .&amp; 1.1 _ are
			<lb />
			pu blic servanq within the meaoin1 of the oroyisions of the
			<lb />
			Preven tion of Commtio n Act. 1988?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			153.
			<lb />
			In the present case, Canfina is a Company incorporated
			<lb />
			under the Companies Act and is 100% subsid iary of the Canara Bank
			<lb />
			which is, admittedly, a Nationalized Bank. CBMF is a trust registered
			<lb />
			under the Indian Trusts Act and the Canara Bank is the settler of the
			<lb />
			Trust. Accused No.1 -S. Mohan and Accused No. 8 -M.K. Ashok
			<lb />
			Kumar who were working with Canfina were removed from service
			<lb />
			during investigation. Similarly, accused No. 3 -B. It Acharya and
			<lb />
			accused No.11 -B.V. Srinivasan also had left service during the course
			<lb />
			of investigation. So far as accused No.2 -N. Balasubramaniam is
			<lb />
			concerned, Mr. K. N. Karnath, Chairman and Managing Director,
			<lb />
			Canbank Financial Services Ltd, has accorded sanction under section
			<lb />
			19(l)(c) of the Pre vention of Corruption Act, 1988 dated 23/2/1996
			<lb />
			for prosecution of the said accused. Similarly, Mr. G.A. Shenai, Chief
			<lb />
			Executive Office r of Canbank Mutual Fund also has accorded sanction
			<lb />
			under section 19(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 by
			<lb />
			letter dated 04/03/1996 for prosecution of accused No. 4 -PJ.
			<lb />
			Subbararo.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			154.
			<lb />
			It has been urged by the learned Counsel appearing on
			<lb />
			behalf of accused No. 4 -PJ. Subbarao that he was an employee of
			<lb />
			the CBMF which is a registered Trust. He is not a public servant
			<lb />
			within the meaning of section 2(c) of the Prevention of Corrup tion
			<lb />
			Act, 1988. He submitted that, therefore, the charges under section
			<lb />
			13(1)(c) read with section 13 (2) are not attracted. In respect of the
			<lb />
			said submission he relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the
			<lb />
			case of
			<lb />
			Can ara Bank and . Others VS. National Theana l Power
			<lb />
			Corooration and another reported in (2001) 1 SCC 43. The learned
			<lb />
			192
			<lb />
			Counsel appearing on behalf of accused No.4 has also submitted that
			<lb />
			the sanction was not properly given and there was non-application of
			<lb />
			mind. Similar submissions have been made by the learne d Counsel
			<lb />
			appearing on behalf of accused No.2 in respect of the sanction
			<lb />
			accorded by Mr. K. N. Karnath -P.W.14.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			155.
			<lb />
			On the other hand, Mr. V.G. Pradhan, the learned Special
			<lb />
			Public Prosecutor appearing on behalf of CBl relied on the provisions
			<lb />
			of section 2(c)(vili) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
			<lb />
			He also
			<lb />
			invited my attention to dictionary meaning of the term community at
			<lb />
			large in Prem&apos;s Judicial Dictionary as also in P. Ramanatha Aiyar&apos;s the
			<lb />
			Law Lexicon.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			156.
			<lb />
			In the present case, it is an admitted position that the
			<lb />
			Canara Bank is a Nationalized Bank and, therefore, the employees of
			<lb />
			Canara Bank and Canfina who is the 100% subsidiary of the cartara
			<lb />
			bank are, therefore, public servants falling withih the definition bf
			<lb />
			section 2(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. So far as
			<lb />
			employees of CBMF are concerned, in my view, it will have to be held
			<lb />
			that they are public servants within the meaning of provisions of
			<lb />
			section 2(b) (c) of the Preve ntion of Corruption Act, 1988. It will be
			<lb />
			relevant to refer to the provisions of section 2(c) (viii) of the said Act
			<lb />
			which reads as under:•
			<lb />
			&quot;2. Definitions.-In this Act, unless the

			any public duty by virtue of his office is, therefore, deemed to be a
			<lb />
			public servari t. In this context, therefore, the definition of public duty
			<lb />
			is important. ln the present case, CBMF undertook putch.ase and sme
			<lb />
			of public securities on behalf of small and large investors in ordet to
			<lb />
			ensure that they receive handsome profit in respect of the funds whith

			<lb />
			The conjoint reading of section 2(b)(c)(viii ) with the word
			<lb />
			community, therefore, clearly implies that the Trust which is
			<lb />
			registered by the Nationalized Bank as its principal settlor, there fore,
			<lb />
			undertakes activities on behalf of the Nationalized Bank and,
			<lb />
			therefore, employees of such a Trust perform public duty. Similarly,
			<lb />
			the term &quot;public duty&quot; which is defined m section 2(b) and more
			<lb />
			particularly the explanation which is given beneath the said definition
			<lb />
			discloses that the word 11State11 includes a corporation established by or
			<lb />
			under a Central, Provincial, or State Act, or an authority or a body
			<lb />
			owned or controlled or aided by the Government or a Government
			<lb />
			company as defined in section 617 of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of
			<lb />
			1956). CBMF, therefore, controlled or aided by the Nationalized Bank
			<lb />
			would squarely fall within the definition of &quot;State&quot; as defined in the
			<lb />
			said explanation and, therefore, the employees of such a Trust would
			<lb />
			be public servants within the definition of section 2 ( c) of the
			<lb />
			Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.

			<lb />
			The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of accused No.4
			<lb />
			has relied on the judgment in the case of Canara Bank &amp; Others
			<lb />
			(supra). In my view, ratio of the said judgment would not apply to the
			<lb />
			facts of the present case. In the first place, the issue which was before
			<lb />
			the Apex Court in the said case was not under the Preve ntion of
			<lb />
			Corruption Act and, therefore, the question before the Apex Court in
			<lb />
			the said case was not whether employees of such a Trust are public
			<lb />
			servants within the meaning of section 2(c) (viii) of the said Act. In
			<lb />
			the said case the appellants were Canara Bank and others, were
			<lb />
			aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court in Company Appeals
			<lb />
			Nos. 23 and 22 of 1996 by which the orders passed by the Company
			<lb />
			Law Board had been set aside and the disputes allegedly existing
			<lb />
			between the parties were referred to the high-powered Committee. It
			<lb />
			was contended before the Apex Court in the said case that the dictum
			<lb />
			of the Apex Court in ONGC&apos;s case [1995 Supp (4) SCC 541] was not
			<lb />
			applicable to the facts of the cases under appeals since there did not
			<lb />
			exist a genuine dispute between the parties which could b� referred to
			<lb />
			the high-powered Committee. In the ONGC&apos;s case the Apex Court has
			<lb />
			observed that the disputes between two public undertakings and
			<lb />
			particularly frivolous litigation between government departments and
			<lb />
			public sector undertakings of the Union of India should not be dragged
			<lb />
			in courts and be amicably resolved by the Committee. In the context
			<lb />
			of the said case, the Apex Court observed that the • ratio -of the
			<lb />
			judgment of the Apex Court in ONGC&apos;s case was not applicable in the
			<lb />
			facts of the said case and while coming to the conclusion has made
			<lb />
			general observations which reads as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;The Trustees of the Trust constituted by
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Canara Bank as Settlor for the benefit of
			<lb />
			numerous unit holders cannot be termed
			<lb />
			and styled as
			<lb />
			government company or
			<lb />
			public sector undertaking.&quot;
			<lb />
			This observation has to be read in the context in which it was made .
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			The Apex Court was considering the dispute between the two public
			<lb />
			sector undertakings and whether the dispute was frivolous and
			<lb />
			imaginary and, in the light of the ratio in ONGC&apos;s case, it observed
			<lb />
			that the trustees of the Trust constituted by the Canara Bank as settlor
			<lb />
			could not be termed as government company or public sector
			<lb />
			undertaking. In my view ratio of the said judgment will not apply to
			<lb />
			the facts of the present case.
			<lb />
			The question which fal ls for
			<lb />
			consideration before th.is Court is whether the employees of such a
			<lb />
			Trust are public servants within the meaning of section 2(c)(viii) oI
			<lb />
			the Prevention of Corruption Act. The said observations of the Apex
			<lb />
			Court in the sai d case, therefore, will not apply to the facts of the
			<lb />
			present case. It is a settled position in law that the judgment of the
			<lb />
			Apex Court should not be read as statute and the ratio of the
			<lb />
			judgments has to be interpreted in the facts and circumstances of the
			<lb />
			said case. It has also been held that if the facts are different then the
			<lb />
			said ratio will not apply to any other case. The apex Court in Zee
			<lb />
			Telefilms Ltd. and another vs. Union of India and others reported in
			<lb />
			(2005) 4 sec 649 has observed in paras 254, 255 &amp; 256 as under: -
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Precedent
			<lb />
			254. Are we bound hands and fe et by
			<lb />
			Pradeep Kumar Biswas (2002) 5 SCC 111? The
			<lb />
			answer to the question must be found in the
			<lb />
			law of precedent. A decision, it is trite, should
			<lb />
			not be read as a statute.
			<lb />
			A decision is an
			<lb />
			authority for the questions of law determined
			<lb />
			by it. Such a question is determined having
			<lb />
			regard to the fact situation obtaining therein.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			While applying the ratio, the court may not pick
			<lb />
			out a word or a sentence from the judgment
			<lb />
			divo rced from the context in which the said
			<lb />
			question arose for consideration. A judgment,
			<lb />
			as is well known, must be read in it.s entirety
			<lb />
			and the observations made therein should
			<lb />
			receive consideration in the light of the
			<lb />
			questions raised before it. (See Punjab National
			<lb />
			Bank v. R.L. Vaid (2004) 7 SCC 698).
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			255.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			Although decisions are galore on
			<lb />
			this point, we may refer to a recent one in State
			<lb />
			of Gujarat v. Akhil Gujarat Pravasi V. S.
			<lb />
			Mahamandal (2004) 5 SCC 155 where in this
			<lb />
			Court held : (SCC p. 172, para 19)
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			&quot;It is trite that any observation made
			<lb />
			during the course of reasoning in a judgment
			<lb />
			should not be read divorced from the context in
			<lb />
			which it was used.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			256. It is further well settled that a
			<lb />
			decision is not an authority for a proposition
			<lb />
			which did not fall for its consideration. It is
			<lb />
			also a trite law that a point not raised before a
			<lb />
			court would not be an authority on the said
			<lb />
			question.
			<lb />
			In A-One Granites v. State of U.P.
			<lb />
			(2001) 3 SCC 537 it is stated as fo llows : (SCC
			<lb />
			p. 543, para 11)
			<lb />
			200
			<lb />
			t&apos;ll. This question was considered by the
			<lb />
			Court of Appe al in Lancaster Motor Co.
			<lb />
			(London) Ltd. v. Bremith Ltd. (1941) 1 KB 675
			<lb />
			and it was laid down that when non
			<lb />
			consideration was given to the question, the
			<lb />
			decision cannot be said to be binding and
			<lb />
			precedents sub silentio and without arguments
			<lb />
			are of no moment&quot;
			<lb />
			[See also State of U.P. v. Synthetics and
			<lb />
			Chemicals Ltd. (1991) 4 sec 139, Amit Das v.
			<lb />
			State of Bihar (2000) 5 SCC 488 (SCC para 20),

			489 and Kalyan Chandra. Sarkar v. Rajesh
			<lb />
			Ranjan (2005) 2 SCC 42, See para 42.)&quot;
			<lb />
			In my view, the ratio of the said judgment squarely applies to the facts
			<lb />
			of the present case. For the sai d reasons the judgment of the Apex
			<lb />
			Court in Canara Bank &amp; Others (supra) will not apply to the facts of
			<lb />
			the present case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			158.
			<lb />
			I am, therefore, of the opinion that the employees of CBMF
			<lb />
			would squarely fall with.in the meaning of definition of &quot;public
			<lb />
			servant&quot; as def ined in section (2)(c)(vili) of the Prevention of
			<lb />
			Corruption Act.

		</p>
		<p>

			<lb />
			So far as submission of the learned Counsel appearing on
			<lb />
			behalf of accused No.2 regarding sanction is conce rned, in my view.
			<lb />
			Mr. K.N. Karnath. -P.W.14 has, in his evidence, stated that whenever
			<lb />
			reference was made by CBI seeking sanction, he used to go through
			<lb />
			the records concerning the person working in the Deparnnent of
			<lb />
			Canfina and get clarifications whe never he had doubt and, after
			<lb />
			getting convinced that prima facie case of commission and omission
			<lb />
			had been made out, he would accord sanction. He further stated that
			<lb />
			with regard to the particulars mentioned in sanction order at Exhi bit-
			<lb />
			127, he has verified the original books of Canf ina and other
			<lb />
			documents and that he had fo llowed the same procedure
			<lb />
			for
			<lb />
			accord ing sanction against accused No.2 -N. Balasubramaniam. He
			<lb />
			has further stated that after having gone through the record which
			<lb />
			was placed be fore him, he decided that prosecution was required and
			<lb />
			he accorded sanction to prosecute accused No.2. In the cross
			<lb />
			examination of this witne ss, much emphasis was led on the draft
			<lb />
			sanction and th.is witness has stated in his cross -examination that he
			<lb />
			did not recollect how many vol umes were there. Nothing much turns
			<lb />
			on the cross-examination. A suggestion was put to him that there was
			<lb />
			arbitration proceedings between Canf ina and Canbank Mutual Fund
			<lb />
			and that the case was presented by him before the arbitrator and that
			<lb />
			all the funds which were given under the transactions involved in this
			<lb />
			case were received back on 31/03/1992. Further, suggestion was put
			<lb />
			that the sanction was given by him to take revenge against accused
			<lb />
			No.2 since he had filed Writ Petition in the High Court when he was
			<lb />
			the Managing Director of Canfina.
			<lb />
			Nothing turns on the said
			<lb />
			suggestion which has been put to this witness. The fact remains that
			<lb />
			P.W.14 had applied his mind to the papers which were produced
			<lb />
			before him and he has arrived at a conclusion that it was necessary to
			<lb />
			grant sanction to prosecute.
			<lb />
			I, therefore, hold that there is no
			<lb />
			infirmity in the sanction whi ch is granted by P.W.14 to prosecute
			<lb />
			accused No.2
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			160.
			<lb />
			So far as submission of accused No.4 is concerned on the
			<lb />
			point of grant of sanction by P.W. 15 -G.A. Shenai, in my view,
			<lb />
			submission that there was non-application of mind on the part of
			<lb />
			sanctioning authority and therefore the sanction order was improper,
			<lb />
			cannot be accepted. P.W. 15 in his evidence has stated that the
			<lb />
			particulars mentioned in the sanction order were provided to him by
			<lb />
			the Legal Department and he had gone through the details of the
			<lb />
			transaction and fo und that there is prima facie case against accused
			<lb />
			No. 4 -P. J. Subbarao and, therefore, he issued sanction order. In the
			<lb />
			cro ss-examination by the Counsel for accused No.4, a suggestion was
			<lb />
			put to him that the letters were addressed by accused No.4 to him.
			<lb />
			However, the witness has stated that he did not remember whether
			<lb />
			there was any correspondence between him and accused No.4. He,
			<lb />
			therefore, did not admit or deny the suggestion that he was not
			<lb />
			conversant with the signature• or handwriting of accused No.4. He
			<lb />
			also di d not remember having received any draft sanction order from
			<lb />
			CBI. He was shown letter dated 15/4/1993 -Exh.ibit-A-1(1) and he
			<lb />
			has stated that he did not remember th.at this letter was placed before
			<lb />
			him by the Legal Department and that the letter was not connected to
			<lb />
			CBMF but was connected to Canfina. He was also shown two cheques
			<lb />
			dated 19/01/1992 for Rs 5 crores at Exhi bit-108 and cheque dated
			<lb />
			11/02/1992 for Rs 7 crores at Exhibit-109 and he has stated that,
			<lb />
			according to him, these cheques may not have been placed before him
			<lb />
			by the Legal Department. He also admitted that he was not in the
			<lb />
			Canbank Mutual Fund during the relevant period. He has also stated
			<lb />
			that the entire charge�sheet of the case was not placed before him by
			<lb />
			the CBI. A question was asked, apart from the material mentioned in
			<lb />
			the sanction order, no other material was placed before him by CBl
			<lb />
			and to this question this witness has answered that whatever material
			<lb />
			that was relevant for sanction was placed before him. In my view,
			<lb />
			therefore, from the evidence of this witness, it cannot be said that
			<lb />
			there was non-application of mind on the part of P.W.15 for granting
			<lb />
			sanction to prosecute accused No.4. The submission of the learned
			<lb />
			Counsel appearing on behalf of accused No.4 in respect of sanction
			<lb />
			being invalid, cannot be accepted.
			<lb />
			For the same reasons the
			<lb />
			submissions made by the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of
			<lb />
			accused No. 3 -B.R. Acharya that the employees of CBMF are not
			<lb />
			public servants cannot be accepted.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			161.
			<lb />
			It is necessary to consider the relevant sections in order
			<lb />
			to examine whether the prosecution has proved the charges vis-a-vis
			<lb />
			the afore said sections against the accused. The accused have been
			<lb />
			charged in the fo llowing manner:-
			<lb />
			Accused Nos.1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 11 are employees of
			<lb />
			c.anf ina &amp; CBMF and they have been charged under
			<lb />
			sections, 120-B7 403 , 405, 409, 467, 471, and
			<lb />
			477A
			<lb />
			of the IPC and section 13(1)(c) read with section 13(2) of
			<lb />
			the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988
			<lb />
			Accused Nos. 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 are the brokers who
			<lb />
			are charged under sections 120-B, 403, 409 of the IPC
			<lb />
			and for abetment under section 109 read with sections
			<lb />
			403, 405, 409, 471, 477A, 467, and section 13(l)(c) read
			<lb />
			with section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act,
			<lb />
			1988.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			162.
			<lb />
			For proving the offence under IPC with which the accused
			<lb />
			have been charged and more particularly sections 403, 405, 409, the
			<lb />
			burden is on the prosecution to establish the dishonest intention on
			<lb />
			the part of the accused and, therefore, definition of the word
			<lb />
			&quot;dishonestly&quot; becomes relevant. This is defined under sections 24 of
			<lb />
			the Indian Penal Code. It is, therefore, necessary to examine the
			<lb />
			individual section and see whether the prosecution has proved, beyond
			<lb />
			reasonable doubt, that the accused have committed the said offences
			<lb />
			with which they are ch arged. Section 24 of the lndian Penal Code,
			<lb />
			reads as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;24.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			&quot;Dishonestly&apos;&apos;.-Whoever does
			<lb />
			anything with the intention of causing
			<lb />
			WTongful gain to one person or wrongful
			<lb />
			loss to another person, is said to do that
			<lb />
			thing &quot;dishonestly&quot;.
			<lb />
			The definition of the said provision becomes relevant in view of the
			<lb />
			fact that this word is used in section 403 and section 405. Section
			<lb />
			403 reads as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			1140 3.
			<lb />
			Dishonest misappropriat i
			<lb />
			on of
			<lb />
			pr o perty.-
			<lb />
			Whoever
			<lb />
			dishonestly
			<lb />
			misappropriates or converts to his own use
			<lb />
			any movable property, shall be punished with
			<lb />
			imprisonment of either description for a term
			<lb />
			which may extend to two years, or with fine,
			<lb />
			or with both.
			<lb />
			Fxplanati.on-1 -A dishonest misappropriation
			<lb />
			for a time only is a misappropriation with the
			<lb />
			meaning of this section.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			F.xplanation-2 -A person who finds property
			<lb />
			not m the possession of any other person, and
			<lb />
			takes such property for the purpose of
			<lb />
			protecting it for, or of restoring it to, the
			<lb />
			owner does not take or misappropriate it
			<lb />
			dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence;
			<lb />
			but he is guilty of the offence above defined,
			<lb />
			if he appropriates it to his own use, when he
			<lb />
			knows or has the means of discovering the
			<lb />
			owner, or before• he has used reasonable
			<lb />
			means to discover and give notice to the
			<lb />
			owner and has kept the property a reasonable
			<lb />
			time to enable the owner to claim it.
			<lb />
			What are reasonable means or what is a
			<lb />
			reasonable time in such a case, is a question
			<lb />
			of fact.
			<lb />
			1t is not necessary that the finder should
			<lb />
			know who is the owner of the property, or
			<lb />
			that any particular person is the owner of it;
			<lb />
			it is sufficient if, at the time of appropriating
			<lb />
			it, he does not believe it to be his own
			<lb />
			property, or in good faith. believe that the real
			<lb />
			owner cannot be fo und.&quot;
			<lb />
			Section 405, on the other hand, defines what is criminal breach of
			<lb />
			trust. In both these sections, it has to be established that the accused
			<lb />
			has dishonestly misappropriated the property. Section 403 talks about
			<lb />
			movable property, whereas section 405 merely talks about the
			<lb />
			property . From the perusal of section 403 including the explanation, it
			<lb />
			can be seen that the misappropriation even for temporary period
			<lb />
			constitutes an offence under the said provision, whereas under section
			<lb />
			405, it has to be established that the accused was entrusted with the
			<lb />
			property. The section, however, qualifies the entrustment by stating
			<lb />
			that it should be entrusted in any manner with the property or with
			<lb />
			the dominion over the property. Section 409 is an aggravated form of
			<lb />
			offence which is committed by a public servant or by banker, merchant
			<lb />
			or agent.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			163.
			<lb />
			In the pre sent case, it has been urged on behaJf of the
			<lb />
			accused Nos. 1 to 4, 8 and 11 that there was no dishonest
			<lb />
			misappropriation and, at the highest, it is an irregularity as submitted
			<lb />
			by the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of accused No.3.
			<lb />
			Secondly, it is urged that these accused were not benefited in any
			<lb />
			manner and, therefore, it was not a conversion for their own use. It is
			<lb />
			th.en argued that since the element of mens rea was not proved,
			<lb />
			offence of criminal breach of trust has not been established. It is also
			<lb />
			urged by the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of accused No.1, 3
			<lb />
			&amp; 8 that they had acted on the instructions of their superior officers
			<lb />
			who were very well aware of the transactions and, therefore, it was
			<lb />
			one of the many regular transactions. It is also urged th.at since th�
			<lb />
			money had been returned back with profit, it is established that there
			<lb />
			was no dishonest intention and, therefore, offence under sections 403,
			<lb />
			409 was not established. In support of the said submissions, the
			<lb />
			learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the accused has relied on
			<lb />
			number of judgments.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			164.
			<lb />
			The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of brokers, on the
			<lb />
			other hand, have submitted that this was a transaction of purchase and
			<lb />
			sale of securities and that the money was returned back and, in the
			<lb />
			process, Canfi.na had earned profi t of more that Rs 1 crore. It is also
			<lb />
			urged that no claim was made by Canfina against CBMF in the
			<lb />
			arbitration proceedings. Complaint was also not filed by Canfina or
			<lb />
			CBMF and, therefore, CBI did not have any locus to file complaint
			<lb />
			unde r sections 403, 405 of the IPC. It is also urged that section 403
			<lb />
			and 405 are mutually exclusive and the person cann ot be charged
			<lb />
			simultaneously under sections 403, 405 of the IPC. It is urged that,
			<lb />
			therefore, the charge of abetment to commit offence under section
			<lb />
			13(1)(c) read with section 13(2) and the offence of forgery and
			<lb />
			fa lsification of accounts also are not established.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			165. I am afraid that submissions made by the learned Counsel
			<lb />
			appearing on behalf of the accused cannot be accepted.
			<lb />
			If the
			<lb />
			provisions of sections 403 and 405 are examined, it can be seen that
			<lb />
			the movable property in section 403 comes in possession of the
			<lb />
			accused in some neutral manner and, thereafter, it is misappropriated
			<lb />
			with the dishonest intention, whereas, so far as section 405 is
			<lb />
			concerned, the provision indicates that the property comes into
			<lb />
			possession of the accused either by express entrustment or by some
			<lb />
			process, placing the accused in the position of trust. I am of the view
			<lb />
			that all the ingredients of sections 403 and 405 have been established
			<lb />
			by the prosecution against accused Nos. 1, 3, 8. The prosecution has
			<lb />
			brought on record Exhibits-17 and 18 which are the Board
			<lb />
			Resolutions, which clearly establish entrustment. Exhibit-57 is an
			<lb />
			Articles of Association which also authorizes the entrustment in favour
			<lb />
			of Board of Directors who have, in tum, entrusted the property to
			<lb />
			accused Nos. 1 and 8. The entrustment is an indisputable fact which
			<lb />
			has not been questioned by accused Nos. 1 &amp; 8. They have not put
			<lb />
			any suggestion, denying the said entrustment. For the offences under
			<lb />
			section 403, 405 and 409, dishonest intention of the accused has to be
			<lb />
			established. It is quite well settled position in law that intention being
			<lb />
			a state of mind, there cannot be direct evi dence to show that the state
			<lb />
			of mind existed. However, the conduct and overt act of the accused
			<lb />
			can establish the dishonest intention and it is a strong circumstance
			<lb />
			which establishes that there existed dishonest intention on the part of
			<lb />
			the accused on the basis of conduct and over act of the accused. In the
			<lb />
			present case, as I have already discussed, it has been establishe d that
			<lb />
			though the accused did not have power to enter into any transaction
			<lb />
			beyond Rs 50 lakhs, accused Nos. 1 and 8 transferred huge amounts of
			<lb />
			Rs 17.29 crores, 12 crores and 5 crores, even if the remaining
			<lb />
			transactions of Rs 5 crores and Rs 7 crores are excluded, by creating
			<lb />
			false documents and making false entries showing as if they had
			<lb />
			entered into a regular transaction. After having prepared the Deal Pad
			<lb />
			entry or after having instructed accused No.2 and other Officers to
			<lb />
			prepare Deal Pad entry, no entry was made in the Sauda Book. This is
			<lb />
			the first act which shows dishonesty on the part of accused Nos. 1 &amp; 8
			<lb />
			from Canfina. Further, they did not have any authority beyond Rs 50
			<lb />
			lakhs without obtaining sanction from the higher executive viz Board
			<lb />
			of Directors either by way of written permission or in the form of a
			<lb />
			Resolution by the Board. This is the second circumstance which
			<lb />
			establishes dishonesty on the part of the said accused. The third
			<lb />
			circumstance which shows dishonesty on their part is that the accused
			<lb />
			Nos . 1 &amp; 8, without waiting to get collateral security either in the form
			<lb />
			of physical share certificates or B.R., on the very same day transferred
			<lb />
			the said amount of Rs 17.29 crores on 10/10/1991, Rs 12 crore s on
			<lb />
			22/10/1991 and Rs 5 crore s on 16/01/1992 on the basis of telephonic
			<lb />
			instructions and conveying IBA number which was later on put in the
			<lb />
			register of IBAs. After having re mitted the said amount, there was no
			<lb />
			correspondence on their part to check whether a contract note is
			<lb />
			received from the broker or whether physical securities are received or
			<lb />
			to see whether the said amount has re ached the person to whom it
			<lb />
			was sent. This is another circumstance which shows dishonesty on the
			<lb />
			part of the accused. This dishonest intention is furthe r fortifi ed when
			<lb />
			a fa lse record is prepared by accused Nos. 3 at the end of CBMF. The
			<lb />
			vouchers at Exhi bits-178 and 106 further indicates their dishonest
			<lb />
			intention and collusion and connivance between accused Nos. 1 and 8
			<lb />
			on the one hand and accused Nos. 3 on the other hand of the CBMF.
			<lb />
			Accused Nos. 3 &amp; 8 have made entries to show that as if this amount
			<lb />
			was wrongly remitted by Canfina to CBMF. The honest intention
			<lb />
			could have been seen if the amount was promptly remitted back to
			<lb />
			Canfina. In.stead of doing so, this amount is transmitted in favour of
			<lb />
			the brokers viz accused Nos. 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 . . Accused No.3 on the
			<lb />
			one hand directs accused No.4 and 11 to prepare a cheque on
			<lb />
			09/10/1 991, though the Deal Pad entry is made by accused Nos. 1 &amp; 8
			<lb />
			on 10/10/1991. The attendance register which is produced by the
			<lb />
			prosecution shows that the accused No.3 was not present in off ice on
			<lb />
			10/10/1991 and that he had got this cheque prepared on 9/10/1991
			<lb />
			itself. This is a clear indication of collusion between accused Nos. 1 &amp;
			<lb />
			8 and accused Nos. 3 and these accused, simultaneously, on the same
			<lb />
			213
			<lb />
			day, remitted this amount to the accounts of accused Nos. 6,7,9 and
			<lb />
			10 in respect of transaction dated 10/10/1991 and 22/10/1991 and in
			<lb />
			favour of accused No.5 in respect of. transaction dated 16/01/1992.
			<lb />
			Accused Nos. 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 were aware that the said amount was
			<lb />
			going to be received by them, which is evi dent from the fact that on
			<lb />
			the very same day, they utilized the said amount for their own
			<lb />
			purposes. It is, therefore , dearly established that there was a
			<lb />
			conspiracy on the part of the accused to siphon off the money in order
			<lb />
			to enable the brokers to use that money for their own purposes. The
			<lb />
			offence of criminal breach of trust &amp; misappropriation has been
			<lb />
			established against accused Nos. 1 and 8 and accused Nos. 3 and
			<lb />
			brokers
			<lb />
			therefore
			<lb />
			have
			<lb />
			abetted
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			said
			<lb />
			act
			<lb />
			of criminal
			<lb />
			misappropriation and criminal breach of trust by accused Nos. 1 and 8
			<lb />
			and accused Nos. 3 also have abetted offence under section 13(1)(c)
			<lb />
			read with section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
			<lb />
			Merely because the said amount was remitted does not absolve the
			<lb />
			accused from the offence of temporary misappropriation which is an
			<lb />
			offence under section 403 of the Indian Penal Code. Another aspect
			<lb />
			which also proves the dishonest intention on the part of the accused is
			<lb />
			the fact which has come on record that CBMF was not regularly
			<lb />
			dealing with the purchase and sale securities on behalf of Canfina
			<lb />
			which evidence has not been challenged by any of the accused.
			<lb />
			If
			<lb />
			that was the admitted position, there was no occasion for accused Nos.
			<lb />
			1 and 8 to remit the amount to CBMF for making payment to the
			<lb />
			brokers. Since Canfina itself was dealing in the purchase and sale of
			<lb />
			securities, it could have directly sent the money to the brokers after
			<lb />
			having received physical security or collateral security in the form of
			<lb />
			B.R. That being the positio� the accused Nos. 1 and 8 who were
			<lb />
			aware of this fact, remitte d the amount to accused Nos. 3 who, in tum,
			<lb />
			were aware th.at they were not dealing in purchase and sale of
			<lb />
			securities on behalf of Canfina, yet, they remitted this amount to
			<lb />
			accused Nos. 6,7,8, 9 &amp; 10 and accused No.5
			<lb />
			The prosecution,
			<lb />
			therefore, has clearly established defalcation of money by all the
			<lb />
			accused. Though an attempt has been made to raise a defence that
			<lb />
			these were the regular transactions and that the brokers had numerous
			<lb />
			transactions with Canfina, CBMF and Canara Bank and that the
			<lb />
			transactions in question were few of such transactions, this theory
			<lb />
			cannot be accepted since the the prosecution has established that these
			<lb />
			were fictitious transactions and, for th.at purpose, fictitious acco unts
			<lb />
			were prepared and manufactured by the accus ed. Therefore, I am of
			<lb />
			the view that the defence has not been in a position to establish that
			<lb />
			there was no dishonest intention and, on the other hand, the
			<lb />
			prosecution by bringing on record circumstantial evidence in the form
			<lb />
			of documents and oral evi dence established dishonest and fraudulent
			<lb />
			intention on the part of the accused who have acted in conspiracy and
			<lb />
			there was collusion and connivance on their part and, therefore, they
			<lb />
			acted in furtherance of the said conspiracy which fact is established
			<lb />
			from the chronology of events and the false documents which are
			<lb />
			prepared. The conduct of accused No.1, 3, S, 6, 7, 8, 9 &amp; 10 clearly
			<lb />
			established that there was a consensus and common knowledge
			<lb />
			amongst them about the transfer of money from Canfina to CBMF and
			<lb />
			from CBMF to brokers i.e. accused Nos.5, 6, 7, 9 &amp; 10 and all this had
			<lb />
			happened in clock work precision manner which could not have taken
			<lb />
			place unless there was a collusion and connivance of the accused. An
			<lb />
			attempt has been made by the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of
			<lb />
			brokers viz. accused No.5, 6, 8, 9 &amp; 10 to show that when a notice was
			<lb />
			issued under section 91 of the Cr.P.C., they had, in advance, given this
			<lb />
			information about the transaction to the Investigating Officer and that
			<lb />
			the Investigating Officer had not verified this fact from the Canara
			<lb />
			Bank. An attempt also has been made to show as if CBMF had
			<lb />
			wrongly received 5 lakhs shares of RIL and that they were, thereafter,
			<lb />
			remitted to Canfina. In my view, the very fact that they had given
			<lb />
			explanation to the Investigating Officer in their reply to the show-
			<lb />
			ca.use notice which was issued under section 91 of the Cr.P.C., in fact,
			<lb />
			for tifi es the fact of alleged conspiracy. It indicates that they had
			<lb />
			already decided to create an impression that there was regular
			<lb />
			transaction, when, in fact, such transaction did not exist which is
			<lb />
			evident from the evidence which is discussed by me hereinabove. This
			<lb />
			submission made by the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the
			<lb />
			accused, therefore, also cannot be accepted.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			166.
			<lb />
			It would be relevant also to consider the provisions of
			<lb />
			section 13(1)(c) and 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988
			<lb />
			which reads as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			13. Criminal misconduct by a public
			<lb />
			servant.-(1) a public servant is said to

			<lb />
			Any public servant who commits
			<lb />
			criminal misconduct shall be punishable
			<lb />
			with imprisonment for a term which shall
			<lb />
			be not less than one year but which may
			<lb />
			extend to seven years and shall also be
			<lb />
			liable to fine.&quot;
			<lb />
			In the present case, I have already held that accused Nos. 1, 3, 8 are
			<lb />
			public servants within the meaning of section 2(c) of the Preve ntion of
			<lb />
			Corruption Act, 1988. I have given detailed reasons to indicate that
			<lb />
			accused Nos.I and 8 did not have requisite authority and they had
			<lb />
			dishonestly misappropriated the property which was under their
			<lb />
			control and siphoned off the funds so as to enable accused Nos. 5,6, 7, 9
			<lb />
			and 10 to utilize the funds for their own purposes. Accused Nos. 3
			<lb />
			who was an employee of CBMF has dishonestly and fraudulently
			<lb />
			misappropriated the amount which was remitted to CBMF and the sai d
			<lb />
			amount was diverted to brokers i.e. accused Nos. 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10. He
			<lb />
			has, there fore, committed an offence punishable under section
			<lb />
			13(1)(c) read with section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act
			<lb />
			and the accused Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 &amp; 10 have abetted these public
			<lb />
			servants in the commission of the sai d offence and, therefore , they are
			<lb />
			also liable for abetment for the offence punishable under section
			<lb />
			13(1)(c) read with section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			167. I have already discussed at great length how Deal Pad entries
			<lb />
			were fabricated and false vouchers were prepared by accused Nos.1, 8
			<lb />
			and 3. They have, therefore, committed an offence punishable under
			<lb />
			section 477A of the Indian Penal Code.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			168. The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the accused have
			<lb />
			relied upon number of judgments on various points. Perusal of the
			<lb />
			said judgment indicates that ratio of the sai d judgments does not apply
			<lb />
			to the facts of the present case.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			169.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, I record the findings agai nst the points for
			<lb />
			determination framed in para 17 above as under:-

			<lb />
			I, therefore, hold that ;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(i) The prosecution has established beyond the
			<lb />
			reasonable doubt that accused Nos. 1 and 8 and
			<lb />
			accused No.3 and accused Nos. 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10
			<lb />
			entered into criminal conspiracy to dishonestly
			<lb />
			siphon off the funds of Canfin a and executed

			involving funds
			<lb />
			m
			<lb />
			the said

			CBMF and, thereafter, criminally misappropriated
			<lb />
			the proceeds to the respective accounts of accused
			<lb />
			Nos. 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 and for that purpose
			<lb />
			manipulated and created false and fictitious
			<lb />
			documents and, thereby committed an offence

			<lb />
			Date: 1st April. 2008
			<lb />
			171. Heard Mr. Pradhan and Mr. Mhammane, the learned Special
			<lb />
			Public Prosecutors appearing on behalf of the CBI. It is submitted that
			<lb />
			so far as sentence is concerned since the accused Nos. 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
			<lb />
			and 10 had been held guilty of the offences punishable under section
			<lb />
			120-B read with section 403, 409, 477-A of the 1ndian Penal Code read
			<lb />
			with section 13(1)(c) and 13(2) of the Preve ntion of Corruption Act,
			<lb />
			1988, the lesser sentence may not be imposed and it was submitted
			<lb />
			that consid ering the nature of the crime and the misappropriation of
			<lb />
			the public funds by employees of the Bank and the Trust and the
			<lb />
			illegal use of the money by the broke rs, calls for a very strict sentence.
			<lb />
			Mr. Pradhan, learned Special Public Prosecutor, relied upon the
			<lb />
			225
			<lb />
			judgment of the Apex Court in State of M.P. Vs. Ghanshya m Singh
			<lb />
			repo rted in 2003 SCC (Cri) 1935. He invited my attention to the
			<lb />
			observations made by the Apex Court in the said judgment in respect
			<lb />
			of various aspects which have to be take n into consideration while
			<lb />
			awarding the sentence. He invited my attention to paras 10, 11, 12,
			<lb />
			13, 14 and 17 of the said judgment. He relied upon the judgment in
			<lb />
			the case of Ram Narayan Popl i Vs. Central Bureau of Investigati on
			<lb />
			reported in (2003) 3 sec 641.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			172. Mr. Amit Desai, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of
			<lb />
			accused No.8 submitted that so far as accused No.8 is concerned, no
			<lb />
			independent charges were framed in respect of substantive offences
			<lb />
			against him, since the charges were restricted to three transactions viz
			<lb />
			10/10/1 991, 22/10/1991 and 16/01/1992. He submitted that since
			<lb />
			other charges were not pressed and since accused N o.8 was primarily
			<lb />
			alleged to have been involved in the said two transactions, the lesser
			<lb />
			sentence may be awarded to accused No.8. He submitted that no loss
			<lb />
			was caused to Canfina and the entire amount was returned with
			<lb />
			interest. He submitted that already 15 years have elapsed after the FIR
			<lb />
			was lodged and that the trial was pending for a very long time and
			<lb />
			this is an additional factor which has to be taken into consideration .
			<lb />
			He invited my attention to the case of Ram Narayan Popli (supra) and
			<lb />
			submitted that the Court had award ed lesser sentence in that case. He
			<lb />
			submitted that the Apex Court has observed in the said case that the
			<lb />
			accused should be let off on the sentence which they have already
			<lb />
			undergone. He submitted that in the said case the accused were in jail
			<lb />
			hardly for 10 to 15 days.
			<lb />
			He invited my attention to vanous
			<lb />
			judgments of the Supreme Court in which it had been held that if no
			<lb />
			loss was caused to the complainant, sentence which should be
			<lb />
			awarded should be lesser sentence. He submitted that the parameters
			<lb />
			of the said judgment of the Apex Court would also apply to the present
			<lb />
			case. He submitted that the accused No.8 has already served 28 days
			<lb />
			in custody in the year 1992. He submitted that the accused No.8 also
			<lb />
			had undergone angioplasty after heart attack and that he is suffering
			<lb />
			from various ailments.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			173. Mr. Shah, the learned Counsel appearing for accused No.6
			<lb />
			submitted that accused No.6 was not directly involved and that he had
			<lb />
			no knowledge of what had transpired between Canfina and CBMF and
			<lb />
			that the accused No.7 was looking after the said transactions. He also
			<lb />
			adopted the submissions made by the learned Counsel appearing on
			<lb />
			behalf of accused No.8 and submitted that the lesser sentence may be
			<lb />
			awarded taking into consideration the age of accused No.6. He
			<lb />
			submitted that the accused No.6 had entered into several other
			<lb />
			transactions with Canfina and CBMF and he had no knowledge about
			<lb />
			the present transaction. He submitted that taking into consideration
			<lb />
			all these circumstances, lesser sentence may be awarded to accused
			<lb />
			No.6.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			174.
			<lb />
			Acc�ed No.1 -S. Mohan who has appeared in person has
			<lb />
			submitted that he was a junior officer and was following the
			<lb />
			instructions of accused No.8 -M.K. Ashok Kumar who was the Vice
			<lb />
			President and he had no other option but to follow the directions given
			<lb />
			by accused No.8. He submitted that it has not been established that he
			<lb />
			is benefited in any manner from the entire transaction. He submitted
			<lb />
			that lesser sentence may be awarded to him.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			175.
			<lb />
			The learned Counsel for accused No.3 adopted the
			<lb />
			submissions made by the learned Counsel appearing for accused No.8
			<lb />
			and submitted that lenient sentence may be given to accused No.3.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			176.
			<lb />
			Mr. Kale, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of accused
			<lb />
			No. 5 -Hiten P. Dalal submitted that accused No.5 was involved only
			<lb />
			in one transaction viz. transaction dated 16/1/1992. He submitted
			<lb />
			that there was no financial gain to accused No.5 in the said
			<lb />
			transaction. He submitted that so far as other two transactions are
			<lb />
			concerned, the prose cution had not pressed the charges in re spect of
			<lb />
			these two transactions against accused No.5 and, therefore, he was
			<lb />
			concerned only with a single transaction. He submitted that, therefore,
			<lb />
			lesser sentence may be awarded to accused No.5.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			177. The learne d Counsel appearing on behalf of accu sed No.7
			<lb />
			adopted the arguments made by the learned Counsel appearing on
			<lb />
			behalf of accused No.8 and submitted that the lesser sentence may be
			<lb />
			awarded to accused No. 7.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			178. Mr. Jethmalani, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf
			<lb />
			of accused Nos. 9 and 10 submitted that, at the highest, accused Nos.
			<lb />
			9 and 10 had acted as a conduit to transfer the money which was
			<lb />
			received from CBMF to accused Nos. 6 and 7. He submitted that since
			<lb />
			the Court has accepted the case of accused No.9 and 10 that the
			<lb />
			transaction in question was in respect of purchase of 5 lacs shares of
			<lb />
			RIL, at the highe st, it could be said that they had acted as conduit. He
			<lb />
			submitted that it was a case of these accused that an amount of Rs 5
			<lb />
			lacs had been retained by them towards brokerage but since this
			<lb />
			aspe ct was not accepted by the Court, at the highest, it could be said
			<lb />
			that this amount had been retained by them. He invited my attention
			<lb />
			to the judgment in the case of Ram Narayan Popli (supra) and the
			<lb />
			observations made by the Apex Court in the sai d judgment.
			<lb />
			It is
			<lb />
			submitted that, admittedly, th.e entire amount had been returned to
			<lb />
			Canfina and, at the highest, it could be said that the .amount was
			<lb />
			illegally obtained by the brokers. He submitted that so far as accused
			<lb />
			No.10 is concerned, he is 73 years old and is a a heart patient and he
			<lb />
			has already suffered an heart attack. He submitted that the case is
			<lb />
			pending for a very long time and that is one of the factors which
			<lb />
			should be taken into consideration. He submitted that the Apex Court
			<lb />
			also had observed that the higher off icials had not been prosecuted by
			<lb />
			CBI and only small flies have been prosecuted and this fact was take n
			<lb />
			into consideration by the Apex Court while awarding the sentence.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			179.
			<lb />
			I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions
			<lb />
			made by the learned Public Pro secutors appearing on behalf of the CBI
			<lb />
			and the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the accused.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			180.
			<lb />
			In the present case, it is an admitted position that the amount
			<lb />
			which was siphoned off from Canfma through CBMF to brokers was
			<lb />
			returned back with interest. The fact remains, however, that the
			<lb />
			amount was illegally siphoned off by creating false and fictitious
			<lb />
			entries. I have already taken into consideration various facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances while coming to the conclusion that the charge of
			<lb />
			criminal conspiracy and abetment has been established. The said
			<lb />
			charge having been established, the accused, even if they are not
			<lb />
			directly involved or have not committed an overt act or had no
			<lb />
			knowledge abou t the general conspiracy are still liable. However, the
			<lb />
			another factor which is also to be taken into consideration is the fact
			<lb />
			that the trial is pending for a very long time and some of the accused
			<lb />
			have now reached the age and are senior citizens in the sense that
			<lb />
			accused No.10 is 73 years of age and accused No.6 is 66 years of age
			<lb />
			and some of them are suffering from various ailments. All the brokers
			<lb />
			have already been notifi ed under the Special Courts (Trial of Offences
			<lb />
			Relating to Transactions in Securities) Act, 1992 and all their assets
			<lb />
			have been seized. The Apex Court also in the case of Ram Narayan
			<lb />
			Popli (supra) in para 384 has observed as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;384. The convictions of Accused 1, 3 and 5
			<lb />
			are in order and are maintained. A question
			<lb />
			about the sentence was raised. Normally, cases
			<lb />
			involv ing offences which corrode the economic
			<lb />
			stability are to be dealt with sternly.
			<lb />
			lt is,
			<lb />
			however, noticed that A-5 has died during the
			<lb />
			pendency of the appeal. A-1 and A-3 were
			<lb />
			small flies who appear to have been caught in
			<lb />
			the web of A-S&apos;s machinations.
			<lb />
			Appare nt
			<lb />
			reason for their involvement is greed and
			<lb />
			avarice. There may be substance in the plea
			<lb />
			raised by the learned counsel for the accused
			<lb />
			appellants that higher-ups of MUL and banks
			<lb />
			cannot certainly be unaware of the goings-on,
			<lb />
			and have not been proce eded with and given a
			<lb />
			dear chit. Though this is certainly a matte r of
			<lb />
			concern, yet that cannot be a ground for ta.king
			<lb />
			a sy mpathetic view of A-1 and A-3&apos;s conduct.
			<lb />
			Considering the fact that the occurrence took
			<lb />
			place a decade back, and the trial has spread
			<lb />
			over a few years, and the death of A-5, we feel
			<lb />
			custodial sentence for the period already
			<lb />
			undergone (which we are told was for a
			<lb />
			number of months) would meet the ends of
			<lb />
			justice. While fixing the quantum of sentence,
			<lb />
			we have duly considered the fact that in the
			<lb />
			instant case the amounts have been pa�d back,
			<lb />
			which as noted above, learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			prosecution conceded was a factor for fixing
			<lb />
			the quantum of sentence. The fine amounts
			<lb />
			imposed remain unaltered with the default
			<lb />
			sentence.
			<lb />
			Appeals by A-1, A-3 and A-5 are
			<lb />
			dismissed subject to modification of sentence.
			<lb />
			We respectfully agree with conclusions of
			<lb />
			learned Brother Shah, though not with the
			<lb />
			reasoning in their entirety regarding dismissal
			<lb />
			of the appeals against acquittal of A-2, and
			<lb />
			setting aside the conviction of A-4.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			181.
			<lb />
			It is no doubt true that the Apex Court has in various judgments
			<lb />
			has lai d down guidelines for the purpose of awarding sentence.
			<lb />
			However, there cannot be any strait jacket formula which can be
			<lb />
			adopted while imposing the sentence and the question of the sentence
			<lb />
			will therefore depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.
			<lb />
			The Apex Court in the case of State of M.P. Vs. Ghanshyam Singh,
			<lb />
			reported in 2003 SCC (Cri) 1935 has observed in paragraphs 10, 11,
			<lb />
			12, 13, 14 and 17 as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			111 O.
			<lb />
			The crucial question which needs to be
			<lb />
			decided is the proper sentence and merely because
			<lb />
			of lapse of time, whether the accused is to be
			<lb />
			waived from undergoing it. It is to be noted that
			<lb />
			the sentences prescribed for offences relatable to
			<lb />
			section 304 Part I are imprisonment for life or up
			<lb />
			to a period of 10 years. It is true that no mini.mum
			<lb />
			sentence has been prescri bed. The sentences can
			<lb />
			be compared with prescription of similar sentences
			<lb />
			and other provisions like Section 326 IPC and
			<lb />
			Section 307 JpC when hurt is caused. Section 304
			<lb />
			Part I is a species of homici dal death.
			<lb />
			It is
			<lb />
			statutorily descri bed as culpable homicide though
			<lb />
			not amounting to murder as defined under !PC.
			<lb />
			Taking note of the purpose for which a sentence is
			<lb />
			impos ed, it cannot be laid down as a rule of
			<lb />
			universal application that a long passage of time in
			<lb />
			all cases would justify minimal sentence.
			<lb />
			Long
			<lb />
			pendency of a matter by itself could not justify
			<lb />
			lesser sentence.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			1111. The law regulates social interests, arbitrates
			<lb />
			conflicting claims and demands Security of persons
			<lb />
			and property of the people is an essential func. tion
			<lb />
			of the State.
			<lb />
			It could be achieved through
			<lb />
			instrumentality of criminal law.
			<lb />
			Undoubtedly,
			<lb />
			there is a cross-cultural conflict where living law
			<lb />
			must find an answer to the new challenges and the
			<lb />
			courts are required to mould the sentencing system
			<lb />
			to meet the challenges.
			<lb />
			The contagion of
			<lb />
			lawlessness would undermine social order and lay
			<lb />
			it in ruins. Protection of society and stamping out
			<lb />
			criminal proclivity must be the object of law which
			<lb />
			must be achieved by imposing appropriate
			<lb />
			sentence. Therefore, law as a cornerstone of the
			<lb />
			edifice of &quot;order&quot; should meet the challenges
			<lb />
			confronting the society. Friedman in his Law in
			<lb />
			Changing Society stated that, &quot;State of criminal law
			<lb />
			continues to be -as it should be -a decisive
			<lb />
			reflection of social consciousness of society.
			<lb />
			11
			<lb />
			Therefore, in operating the sentencing syste m, law
			<lb />
			should adopt the corrective machinery or the
			<lb />
			deterrence based on factual matrix.
			<lb />
			By deft
			<lb />
			modulation sentencing process has to be stem
			<lb />
			where it should be, and tempered with mercy
			<lb />
			where it warrants to be.
			<lb />
			The facts and given
			<lb />
			circumstances in each case, the nature of the crime,
			<lb />
			the manner in which it was planned and
			<lb />
			committed, the motive for commission of the
			<lb />
			crime, the conduct of the accused, the nature of
			<lb />
			weapons
			<lb />
			used
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			all
			<lb />
			other , attending
			<lb />
			circumstances are relevant facts which would enter
			<lb />
			into the area of consideration. For instance, a
			<lb />
			murder committed due to deep-seated mutual and
			<lb />
			personal rivalry may not call fo r penalty of
			<lb />
			death.
			<lb />
			But an organized crime or mass murder of innocent
			<lb />
			people would call for imposition of death sentence
			<lb />
			as deterrence. In Mahesh v. State of M.P. [(1987)
			<lb />
			3 sec 80] this court while refus ing to reduce the
			<lb />
			death sentence observed thus: (SCC p.82, para 6)
			<lb />
			It will be a mockery of justice to permit the
			<lb />
			accused to escape the extreme penalty of law when
			<lb />
			faced with such evidence and such crue l acts. To
			<lb />
			give the lesser punishment for the accused wo uld
			<lb />
			be to render the justicing system of the country
			<lb />
			suspect. The common man will lose faith in courts.
			<lb />
			In such cases, he understands and appreciates the
			<lb />
			language of deterrence more than the reformative
			<lb />
			jargon.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot; 1 2.
			<lb />
			Therefore, undue sympathy to impose
			<lb />
			inadequate sentence would do more harm to the
			<lb />
			justice system to undermine the public confidence
			<lb />
			in the efficacy of law and society could not long
			<lb />
			endure under such serious threats. It is, therefore,
			<lb />
			the duty of every court to award proper sentence
			<lb />
			having regard to the nature of the offence and the
			<lb />
			manner in which it was executed or committed etc.
			<lb />
			This position was illuminatingly state d by this
			<lb />
			Court in Sevaka Perumal v. State of T.N. [ ( 1 991) 3
			<lb />
			sec 471]&apos;&apos;
			<lb />
			11 1 3.
			<lb />
			Criminal law adheres in general to the
			<lb />
			principle to the principle of proportionality in
			<lb />
			prescribing liability according to the culpability of
			<lb />
			each kind of criminal conduct. It ordinarily allows
			<lb />
			some significant discretion to the Judge in arri ving
			<lb />
			at a sentence in each case, presumably to permit
			<lb />
			sentences that reflect more subtle considerations
			<lb />
			culpability that are raised by the special facts of
			<lb />
			each case.
			<lb />
			Judges, in essence, affirm that
			<lb />
			punishment ought always to fit the • crime; yet in
			<lb />
			practice sentences are determined largely by other
			<lb />
			considerations. Sometimes, it is the correctional
			<lb />
			needs of the perpetrator th.at are offered to justify a
			<lb />
			sentence,
			<lb />
			sometimes the desirability of keeping
			<lb />
			him out of circulation, and sometimes even the
			<lb />
			tragic results of his crime.
			<lb />
			Inevitably, these
			<lb />
			considerations cause a departure from just deserts
			<lb />
			as the basis of punishment and create cases of
			<lb />
			apparent
			<lb />
			injustice
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			are
			<lb />
			serious
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			widespread.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;14. Proportion betwee n crime and punishment is
			<lb />
			a goal respected in principle, and in spite of errant
			<lb />
			notions, it remains a strong influence in the
			<lb />
			termination of sentences.
			<lb />
			The practice of
			<lb />
			punishing all serious crimes with equal severity is
			<lb />
			now unknown in civilized societies, but such a
			<lb />
			radical
			<lb />
			departure
			<lb />
			from
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			principle
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			proportionality has disappeared from the law only
			<lb />
			in recent times.
			<lb />
			Even now for a single grave
			<lb />
			infraction drastic sentences are imposed. Anything
			<lb />
			less than a penalty of greatest severity fo r any
			<lb />
			serious crime is thought then to be a measure of
			<lb />
			toleration that is unwarranted and unwise. But in
			<lb />
			fact, quite apart from those considerations th.at
			<lb />
			make punishment unjustifiable when it is out of
			<lb />
			proportion to the crime , uniformly disproportionate
			<lb />
			punishment has some very undesirable practical
			<lb />
			consequences.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			17. Imposition of sentence without considering its
			<lb />
			effect on the social order in many cases may be in
			<lb />
			reality a futile exercise. The social impact of the
			<lb />
			crim.e e.g. where it relates to offences again.st
			<lb />
			women, dacoity, kidnapping, misappropriation of
			<lb />
			public money, treason and other offences involving
			<lb />
			moral turpitude or moral delinquency which have
			<lb />
			great impact on social order and public interest
			<lb />
			cannot be lost sight of and per se require
			<lb />
			exemplary treatment.
			<lb />
			Any liberal attitude by
			<lb />
			imposing
			<lb />
			meagre
			<lb />
			sentences
			<lb />
			or
			<lb />
			t8ki.ng
			<lb />
			too
			<lb />
			sympathetic a view merely on account of lapse of
			<lb />
			ti.me in respect of such offences will be resultwise
			<lb />
			counterproductive in the long run and against
			<lb />
			societal interest which needs to be cared for and
			<lb />
			strengthened by a string of deterrence inbuilt in the
			<lb />
			sentencing system.&quot;
			<lb />
			There cannot be any doubt or two op1ruons about the observations
			<lb />
			made by the Apex court in the sai d judgment. Ke eping in view the
			<lb />
			observations made by the Supreme Court in the case of Maruti Udyog
			<lb />
			and in the case of State of M.P.(supra), in my view, in the present
			<lb />
			case, so far as accused No.I is concerned, he was a junior officer
			<lb />
			working under accused No.8 and he was duty bound to follow the
			<lb />
			instructions which were given by accused No.8.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			182. Under these circumstances, in my view, it will be appropriate if
			<lb />
			accused No.1 -S. Mohan is sentenced to undergo rigorous
			<lb />
			imprisonment for a period of six months.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			183. So far as accused No.3 -B.R. Acharya is concerned, in my view
			<lb />
			taking into consideration the various facts and circumstances of the
			<lb />
			case and more particularly the fact that he was responsible for
			<lb />
			siphoning off the amount from CBMF to the brokers, he was the key
			<lb />
			accused who was responsible for siphoning off the fu nds and wi thout
			<lb />
			his assistance the amount would not have been reached the brokers.
			<lb />
			However, since the amount has already been received back, in my
			<lb />
			view, it would be appropriate to sentence him to undergo ri gorous
			<lb />
			imprisonment for a period of one year.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			184. So far as accused No.8 is concerned, he was a Vice President,
			<lb />
			working with Canfina. On his directions, accused No.I sent money to
			<lb />
			CBMF. Though accused No.8 has been separately charged in respect
			<lb />
			of the other two transactions for the substantial offences, the fact
			<lb />
			remains that he has been convicted for the offences of conspiracy and
			<lb />
			abetment even in respect of transactions dated 10/10/1 991,
			<lb />
			22/10/1 991 and 16/01/1992. In my view, accused No.8 was also the
			<lb />
			(A�J
			<lb />
			key \\Q.taeS-5 and the main conspirator in respect of the scheme of
			<lb />
			siphoning off the funds from Canfina to CBMF and to the said brokers.
			<lb />
			Jn my view, it would be appropriate if he is sentenced to undergo
			<lb />
			rigorous imprisonment for one year.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			185.
			<lb />
			So far as accused No.5 is concerned, it is no doubt true that he
			<lb />
			is involved only in one transaction viz transaction dated 16/01/1992.
			<lb />
			However, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the
			<lb />
			case, it would be appropriate to sentence him to undergo rigorous
			<lb />
			imprisonment for one year.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			186. So far as accused Nos. 6 and 7 are concerned, they have received
			<lb />
			a substantial chunk of the amount which was siphoned off and it
			<lb />
			would be appropriate to sentence th.em to suffer rigorous
			<lb />
			imprisonment for one year.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			187. So far as accused Nos. 9 and 10 are concerned, in my view, it
			<lb />
			would be appropriate to sentence accused No.9 to undergo rigorous
			<lb />
			imprisonment for one year. However, so far as accused No.10 is
			<lb />
			concerned, as was rightly pointed out by Mr. Jethmalani, the learned
			<lb />
			Counsel appearing on his behalf that he has merely signed &apos;the che que
			<lb />
			on behalf of the firm and there is no evidence on record to indicate
			<lb />
			that he has received anything in return personally. He is al.so 73 years
			<lb />
			of age and is a heart patient who has already suffered an heart attack.
			<lb />
			Considering these factors, in my view, it would be approp riate to
			<lb />
			sentence him to undergo simple imprisonment for six months.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			188. It is clarified that under section 428 sentence which is already
			<lb />
			undergone shall be set off against the sentence which is already
			<lb />
			awarded. The learned Counse l appearing on accused No.5 submits
			<lb />
			that accused No.5 has already undergone two and half years sentence
			<lb />
			in respect of conviction in other cases and the period undergone by
			<lb />
			him in the said cases may be set off so far as sentence in this case is
			<lb />
			concerned. In support of his submission he relied upon the judgment
			<lb />
			in the case of State of Maharashtra and another Vs. Najak at alias
			<lb />
			Mubarak Ali. reported in AIR 200 1 SC 2255. In my view, it would be
			<lb />
			appropriate if the li berty is granted to accused No.5 to fil e a separate
			<lb />
			application on this aspect. Accordingly the liberty is granted to
			<lb />
			accused No.5 to fil e separate application on this aspect.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			189.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, the fo llowing order is pa_ ssed:-
