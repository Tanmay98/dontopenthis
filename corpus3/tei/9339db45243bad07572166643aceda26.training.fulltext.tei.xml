			<p>1.<lb/> The Plaintiff --Hindustan Unilever Limited, is a Public Limited<lb/> Company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956. Prior to 1956, the<lb/> name of the Plaintiff was Lever Brothers (India) Limited which was changed to<lb/> Hindustan Lever Limited with effect from 3rd October,1956 and subsequently<lb/> to Hindustan Unilever Limited on 11th June, 2007. The Plaintiff carries on the<lb/> business of manufacturing and selling Fast Moving Consumer Goods<lb/> (&apos;FMCG&apos;), including frozen desserts and ice cream under the mark<lb/> &quot;KWALITY WALL&apos;S&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.<lb/> Defendant No. 1 --Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation<lb/> Limited is a co-operative body of milk producers in Gujarat and is engaged in<lb/> marketing of various dairy and dairy based products including ice creams under<lb/> the mark &quot;AMUL&quot;, and is a competitor of the Plaintiff. Defendant No.2 --<lb/>FCB Ulka Advertising Pvt. Ltd. is an advertising agency.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> Defendant Nos. 3 and 4 -Vadilal Industries Ltd. and Vadilal Dairy<lb/> international Limited are manufacturers of frozen dessert products/the same<lb/> class of products as that of the Plaintiff which are the subject matter of the<lb/> present Suit. According to the Plaintiff, Defendant Nos. 3 and 4 are joined as<lb/> party Defendants to the Suit since they have a common interest with the<lb/> Plaintiff, and are therefore proper parties for the purposes of the present Suit.<lb/> No reliefs are claimed against Defendant Nos. 3 and 4.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.<lb/> According to the Plaintiff, they are one of India&apos;s most well-known and<lb/> reputed Company in the business of FMCG with presence, inter alia, in foods<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> and beverages sectors and home &amp; personal care products. The Plaintiff&apos;s<lb/> products are spread across several distinct consumer categories, touching the<lb/> lives of two out of three Indians. The Plaintiff&apos;s combined sales are over<lb/> several crores. The products of the Plaintiff are of excellent quality, enjoy a very<lb/> high reputation and are sold in over one million retail outlets.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.<lb/> According to the Plaintiff, KWALITY has been a well-known brand in<lb/> India (having been in the market for over 70 years) and was acquired by the<lb/> Plaintiff before foraying into the business of ice creams and desserts in India.<lb/> The said brand KWALITY has been used along with the Plaintiff&apos;s own global<lb/> brand WALL&apos;S as KWALITY WALL&apos;S. Being the first ever brand of ice<lb/> creams to be introduced in the Indian market on a large commercial scale,<lb/> KWALITY enjoys, down to this day, a special status in the eyes of the<lb/> purchasing public being a very popular trade mark. The Plaintiff has been<lb/> manufacturing and selling the KWALITY WALL&apos;S products in India since at<lb/> least 1998. The KWALITY WALL&apos;S products manufactured and sold by the<lb/> Plaintiff command impeccable reputation and goodwill and are well known for<lb/> their quality, taste and texture. According to the Plaintiff, majority of the<lb/> KWALITY WALL&apos;S products sold in India are classified as frozen desserts<lb/> under the Food and Safety Standards Act, 2006 (&apos;FSSA&apos;) and the Regulations<lb/> framed thereunder. The Plaintiff is the market leader amongst the organized<lb/> players in the frozen desserts category with about 51.3% market share. The<lb/> Plaintiff&apos;s products, including its frozen desserts, scrupulously meet, satisfy and<lb/> comply with all requirements of the law, rules, regulations including food safety<lb/> requirements. The Plaintiff&apos;s frozen desserts are safe, healthy, hygienic and fit<lb/> for human consumption. The Plaintiff has made extensive sales of its<lb/> KWALITY WALL&apos;s products all across India.<lb/></p>

			<p>6.<lb/> The present Suit is filed by the Plaintiff to restrain Defendant Nos.1 and<lb/> 2 from inter alia (i) telecasting or broadcasting or otherwise howsoever<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> communicating to the public or publishing two Television Commercials<lb/> (hereinafter, the &apos;Impugned TVCs&apos;) or any part thereof, or any other<lb/> advertisement of a similar nature in any language, or in any manner causing the<lb/> Impugned TVCs or any part thereof or any other advertisement of a similar<lb/> nature to be telecast or broadcast or communicated to the public or published in<lb/> any manner and (ii) disparaging or denigrating the Plaintiff&apos;s KWALITY<lb/> WALL&apos;S products (including frozen desserts manufactured and/ or sold under<lb/> the said brand and sub-brands thereof ), or the Plaintiff&apos;s business in any<lb/> manner whatsoever.<lb/></p>

			<p>7.<lb/> On 29th March 2017, the Plaintiff made an application for urgent ad-<lb/>interim reliefs when this Court granted time to Defendant No.1 to file its<lb/> Affidavit-in-Reply on or before 3rd April 2017, along with its compilation of<lb/> documents. The Defendant No. 1 filed its Affidavit-in-Reply dated 3rd April,<lb/> 2017, along with its compilation of documents. The Plaintiff filed its Affidavit-<lb/>in-Rejoinder dated 5th April, 2017 along with its compilation of documents.<lb/> The Defendant No. 1 raised two preliminary objections viz. (i) issue of<lb/> territorial jurisdiction (paragraph 4.9 of the Affidavit-in-Reply) and (ii)<lb/> maintainability and jurisdiction on the basis of non-issuance of a Notice under<lb/> Section 167 of the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act, 1961 (paragraph 4.10 of<lb/> the Affidavit-in-Reply). However, the Learned Senior Advocate appearing for<lb/> the Defendant No.1, upon instructions of Defendant No.1 on 7th April, 2017,<lb/> waived both the preliminary objections for the purposes of not only the above<lb/> Notice of Motion but also the Suit. In view thereof, the Notice of Motion was<lb/> taken up for final hearing.<lb/></p>

			<p>8.<lb/> The present Suit is in the nature of an action for generic<lb/> disparagement/slander of goods of the product category of Dairy Based<lb/> Desserts referred to as &quot;Frozen Desserts&quot;. Plaintiff is the market leader<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> amongst the organised players for frozen desserts, and as stated above owns<lb/> 51.3 % of the market share. It is submitted by the Plaintiff that the Defendant<lb/> No.1, through the two impugned TVCs seeks to spread false information about<lb/> frozen desserts as a whole by generalizing the entire class of frozen category<lb/> goods, and more particularly that of the Plaintiff which is the market leader in<lb/> respect of the said product category. According to the Plaintiff, though in the<lb/> impugned TVCs no reference/mention is made about the frozen dessert<lb/> products of the Plaintiff, the reference to the frozen dessert and the<lb/> comparison made in the impugned TVCs is obviously and unmistakably<lb/> directed to the KWALITY WALL&apos;S products of the Plaintiff, and it directly<lb/> affects the Plaintiff&apos;s products considering the fact that they are the market<lb/> leaders in that category of products. In view thereof before discussing the<lb/> contents of the two impugned TVCs, at the outset it is necessary to examine as<lb/> to when disparagement of a product can be said to have taken place, and the<lb/> entitlement of a manufacturer of a product to sue for disparagement of its<lb/> product when an entire class of products is disparaged. The law on these issues<lb/> is amongst others laid down in the following judgments:<lb/></p>

			<p>(i) Reckitt &amp; Colman of India Ltd. Vs. M.P. Ramchandran and<lb/> another 1 :<lb/> In this case the plaintiff was the manufacturer of a whitener sold under<lb/> the brand name Robin Blue. The defendants too manufactured a whitener and<lb/> sold their product under the brand name Ujala. It was the case of the plaintiff<lb/> that for the purpose of promoting the sale of Ujala, the defendants sought to<lb/> project the goods of the plaintiff as inferior to that of the defendants. It was<lb/> argued on behalf of defendant No. 1 that in its advertisement it had not<lb/> 1<lb/> . 1999 PTC (19) 741<lb/> projected the product of the petitioner, and the defendant No. 1 has projected<lb/> the entire class of blues; the question therefore of disparaging the product of the<lb/> petitioner did not arise and as such the petitioner had no cause of action; the<lb/> statements made in the advertisement regarding &quot;Blue&quot; are all correct and the<lb/> same had been made to show the technological advancement of the product of<lb/> the defendants.<lb/> The Learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court (Barin Ghosh, J.), after<lb/> discussing various decisions of Courts, has at page 746 summarised the law on<lb/> the subject as follows:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;I) A tradesman is entitled to declare his goods to be best in<lb/> the world, even though the declaration is untrue.<lb/> II) He can also say that his goods are better than his<lb/> competitors&apos; , even though such statement is untrue.<lb/> III) For the purpose of saying that his goods are the best in<lb/> the world or his goods are better than his competitors&apos; he can<lb/> even compare the advantages of his goods over the goods of<lb/> others.<lb/> IV) He however, cannot, while saying that his goods are better<lb/> than his competitors&apos; , say that his competitors&apos; goods<lb/> are bad. If he says so, he really slanders the goods of his<lb/> competitors. In other words he defames his competitors and<lb/> their goods, which is not permissible. (emphasis supplied)<lb/> V) If there is no defamation to the goods or to the<lb/> manufacturer of such goods no action lies, but if there is such<lb/> defamation an action lies and if an action lies for recovery of<lb/> damages for defamation, then the Court is also competent to<lb/> grant an order of injunction restraining repetition of such<lb/> defamation.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>The Learned Single Judge has, after setting out the contentions raised by the<lb/> defendants, rejected the contention of the defendants that since the product of<lb/> the petitioner was not projected in the advertisement, and since the<lb/> advertisement is projected against the entire class of &apos;Blues&apos;, the question of<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> disparaging the product of the petitioner did not arise. The relevant extracts<lb/> from pages 749 and 750 of the said Judgment are reproduced hereunder:<lb/> @ Pg.749 &quot;In sum and substance therefore the defendant No.<lb/> 1 contended as follows:-<lb/></p>

			<item>(i) In the advertisement the defendant No. 1 did not project the<lb/> product of the petitioner;<lb/></item>

			<item>(ii) In the advertisement the defendant No. 1 projected the<lb/> entire class of blues;<lb/></item>

			<item>(iii) Since the product of the petitioner was not projected in the<lb/> advertisement, the question of disparaging the product of the<lb/> petitioner did not arise and as such petitioner has no cause of<lb/> action;<lb/></item>

			<item>(iv) The statements made in the advertisement regarding<lb/> &quot;Blue&quot; are all correct and the same had been made to show the<lb/> technological advancement of the product of the defendants.&quot;<lb/> @ Pg. 750 &quot;Therefore, in a suit of this nature one has to look<lb/> at whether the advertisement merely puffed the product of the<lb/> advertiser or in the garb of doing the same directly or indirectly<lb/> contended that the product of the other trader is inferior.<lb/> There cannot be any dispute that in the concerned<lb/> advertisements blue was stated to be of inferior quality.<lb/> Although, for having depicted the container and the price in<lb/> the advertisement together it is difficult to proceed on the basis<lb/> that the Defendant No. 1 was not referring to Robin Blue, but<lb/> assuming in the advertisement insinuations are not<lb/> made against Robin Blue and the same were directed<lb/> to all blues as has been stated in no uncertain terms<lb/> in the affidavits, can it be said that it was not made<lb/> against Robin Blue? The answer is a definite &quot;no&quot;,<lb/> because Robin Blue is also a blue.<lb/> It was sought to be contended that insinuations against all are<lb/> permissible, though the same may not be permissible against<lb/> one particular individual. I do not accept the same for the<lb/> simple reason that while saying all are bad it was being said all<lb/> and everyone is bad and anyone fitting the description of<lb/> everyone is affected thereby.<lb/> It is true that one can boast about technological superiority of<lb/> his product and while doing so can also compare the<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> advantages of his product with those which are available in the<lb/> market. He can also boast about the relative advantages of his<lb/> own product over the other products available in the market.<lb/> He can also say that the technology of the products available in<lb/> the market has become old or obsolete. He can further add that<lb/> the new technology available to him is far more superior to the<lb/> known technology, but he cannot say that the known<lb/> technology is bad and harmful or that the product made with<lb/> the known technology is bad and harmful. What he can claim is<lb/> only that his product and his technology is superior. While<lb/> comparing the technology and the products manufactured on<lb/> the basis thereof, he can say that by reason of the new superior<lb/> technology available to him, his product is much superior to<lb/> others. He cannot, however, while so comparing say that the<lb/> available technology and the products made in accordance<lb/> therewith are bad and harmful.&quot;(Emphasis Supplied)<lb/></item>

			<p>The Learned Judge held at page 750 of the report that even<lb/> assuming the advertisement would not have made insinuations<lb/> directly against the Plaintiff&apos;s product but the class of goods to<lb/> which the Plaintiff&apos;s goods belonged, it cannot be said that it<lb/> was not made against the Plaintiff&apos;s goods since the Plaintiff&apos;s<lb/> goods also belonged to that class of goods. The Learned Judge<lb/> rejected the contention of the Defendant that insinuation<lb/> against all is permissible though it may not be permissible<lb/> against any one particular individual.<lb/></p>

			<p>(ii)<lb/> Dabur India Limited vs. Colgate Palmolive India Ltd. 2 .<lb/> In this case, the plaintiff manufactured and marketed its<lb/> products under the brand name &apos;Dabur&apos;. The plaintiff in the course<lb/> of its business also manufactured and marketed &apos;Dabur<lb/> Chyawanprash&apos;. The plaintiff claims to have a market share of 63 per<lb/> cent of total market of chyawanprash, which is a health tonic. The<lb/> defendant was also engaged in the manufacture of various ayurvedic<lb/> 2<lb/> . 2004 (29) PTC 401 (Del)<lb/> formulations including chyawanprash under the brand name Himami<lb/> Sona -Chandi Chyawanprash. The defendant introduced a new<lb/> product in the market namely Himani Sona-Chandi Amritprash and<lb/> advertised the same on the audio-visual-media and by way of T.V.<lb/> commercial. In the said advertisement, film star Sunny Deol is shown<lb/> as declaring &quot;Garmion mein chyawanprash bhool jao, himani sona-<lb/>chandi Amritprash khao&quot;, which upon translation in English would<lb/> read as follows: &quot;Forget chyawanprash in summers, eat Amritprash<lb/> instead&quot;. The plaintiff impugned the said commercial and contended<lb/> that the same was a negative campaign of the product of the plaintiff,<lb/> and that there is an effort on the part of the defendant of insinuating<lb/> the product of the plaintiff. It was submitted that the clear message<lb/> that is being sent by airing the said T.V. commercial was that<lb/> consumption of chyawanprash is not advisable during summer season<lb/> and that Amritprash is a more effective substitute of chyawanprash for<lb/> the summer season. It was submitted that the said advertisement/T.V.<lb/> commercial of the product of the defendant is deceptive and dubious<lb/> and a malafide attempt to do negative campaign and bring in an<lb/> insinuating advertisement campaign against the product of the<lb/> plaintiff. It was submitted on behalf of the defendant that the said<lb/> advertisement could not be said to be defamatory nor can it be said<lb/> that it was a measure of negative campaigning. It was submitted that<lb/> the defendant itself is manufacturing and marketing chyawanprash,<lb/> which is to be used in the winter months and not in the summer<lb/> months and therefore only a general statement made by the defendant<lb/> through the commercial/TV advertisement cannot be objected to. It<lb/> was also submitted that chyawanprash is a generic word and there is<lb/> no exclusivity which could be claimed to the said word.<lb/> The Learned single Judge of the Delhi High Court (Dr.<lb/> Mukundakam Sharma, J.) after considering the submissions of the<lb/> parties concluded that, in his considered opinion even if there is no<lb/> direct reference to the product of the plaintiff and only a reference is<lb/> made to the entire class of chyawanprash in the generic sense, even<lb/> in those circumstances disparagement is possible. The Learned<lb/> Judge further proceeded to hold that when the defendant is<lb/> propagating in the advertisement that there should be no<lb/> consumption of chyawanprash during the summer months, it is also<lb/> propagating that the plaintiff&apos;s chyawanprash should also not be<lb/> taken during the summer months as it is not good for health and<lb/> instead Amritprash, which is the defendant&apos;s product, should be<lb/> taken.<lb/> Paragraphs 7, 8, 9 and 11 of the said judgment are<lb/> reproduced hereunder for ready reference:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;7. In the light of the aforesaid legal position, I<lb/> have to scrutinize and examine the position in<lb/> the present case to come to a conclusion as to<lb/> whether or not an injunction should be granted<lb/> in favour of the plaintiff, as prayed for, for any<lb/> disparagement or defamation or insinuation to<lb/> the goods of the plaintiff in the advertisement in<lb/> question. The aforesaid advertisement appears<lb/> on the electronic media for a few seconds and it<lb/> shows Sunny Deol saying that Chyawanprash is<lb/> not to be taken in the summer months and<lb/> instead Amritprash is to be taken. The message<lb/> that is sought to be conveyed by the aforesaid<lb/> T.V commercial is that consumption of<lb/> Chyawanprash during the summer months is<lb/> not advisable and Amritprash is more effective<lb/> substitute for Chyawanprash in summer season.<lb/> The plaintiff is manufacturing and marketing<lb/> and has a market share of 63% of the total<lb/> market of Chyawanprash throughout India and,<lb/> therefore, is vitally interested in seeing that<lb/> Chyawanprash is sold through India during all<lb/> the seasons. If, on the other hand, the said<lb/> product is sold and marketed only for a few<lb/> months of the year and not throughout the year<lb/> the business of the plaintiff is going to be vitally<lb/> and prejudicially affected. It is also brought on<lb/> record that the defendant has a market share of<lb/> about 12% of the total market in Chyawanprash<lb/> throughout India whereas in the market of<lb/> Amritprash, which is a new product being<lb/> brought out by the defendant, there is no other<lb/> competitor in the market. Therefore, what is<lb/> sought to be done by the defendant is to forbid<lb/> and exclude user of Chyawanprash during the<lb/> summer months so that it can exclusively<lb/> capture the Indian market during the summer<lb/> months, which is sought to be done by sending a<lb/> message that consumption of Chyawanprash<lb/> during the summer season serves no purpose<lb/> and Amritprash is more effective substitute<lb/> thereof and thereby attempting to induce an<lb/> unwary consumer into believing that<lb/> Chyawanprash should not be taken in summer<lb/> months at all and Amritprash is the substitute<lb/> for it. The aforesaid effort on the part of the<lb/> defendant would be definitely a disparagement<lb/> of the product Chyawanprash and even in<lb/> generic term the same would adversely affect<lb/> the product of the plaintiff. The presence of the<lb/> defendant in the market is only to the extent of<lb/> 12% of the total market of Chyawanprash in<lb/> India whereas the plaintiff has about 67%<lb/> share/presence in the Indian market and if sale<lb/> of Chyawanprash is weeded out from the<lb/> market during the summer months, the<lb/> plaintiff&apos;s presence in the market for sale of<lb/> Chyawanprash is adversely affected. In my<lb/> considered opinion, even if there be no direct<lb/> reference to the product of the plaintiff and only<lb/> a reference is made to the entire class of<lb/> Chyawanprash in its generic sense, even in<lb/> those circumstances disparagement is possible.<lb/> There is insinuation against user of<lb/> Chyawanprash during the summer months, in<lb/> the advertisement in question, for Dabur<lb/> Chyawanprash is also a Chyawanprash as<lb/> against which disparagement is made. To the<lb/> same effect is the judgment of the Calcutta<lb/> High Court in Reckitt &amp; Colman of India<lb/> Limited v M.P. Ramchandran&amp; Another<lb/> (supra).&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>8.<lb/> &quot;Mr. Chandhiok, appearing for the<lb/> defendant<lb/> vehemently<lb/> submitted<lb/> that<lb/> Chayawanprash is a generic word and the<lb/> plaintiff cannot have a monopoly or sole rights<lb/> of the use of the said generic word and that the<lb/> impugned advertisement, at any rate,<lb/> did not make a slightest reference to the<lb/> product of the plaintiff and on the<lb/> contrar y it makes reference to its own<lb/> product Sona Chandi Amritprash and,<lb/> Therefore, it cannot be said that there<lb/> is any disparagement of the product of<lb/> the plaintiff.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;9. In my considered opinion, when the<lb/> defendant is propagating in the<lb/> advertisement that there should be no<lb/> consumption of Chayawanprash during<lb/> the summer months, it is also<lb/> propagating<lb/> that<lb/> the<lb/> plaintiff &apos;s<lb/> Chayawanprash should not also be taken<lb/> during the summer months as it is not<lb/> good for health and instead Amritprash,<lb/> which is the defendant&apos;s product,<lb/> should be taken. Such an advertisement<lb/> is clearly disparaging to the product of<lb/> the plaintiff as there is an element of<lb/> insinuation<lb/> present<lb/> in<lb/> the<lb/> said<lb/> advertisement.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;11. The defendant could not have<lb/> taken up a plea that Chayawanprash,<lb/> which is a competitor to Amritprash, is<lb/> bad during the summer months and<lb/> since the defendant has resorted to the<lb/> same, the same is disparaging and,<lb/> Therefore, the case in hand calls for an<lb/> action in terms of the prayer made in<lb/> the injunction application …...&quot; (emphasis<lb/> supplied)<lb/></item>

			<p>(iii) Dabur India Ltd. Vs. Colgate Palmolive 3<lb/> In this case, the plaintiff, Dabur India Limited, is the<lb/> manufacturer of Dabur Lal Dant Manjan powder and the defendant<lb/> Colgate Palmolive India Ltd. is the manufacturer of Colgate Tooth<lb/> Powder. The impugned T.V. advertisement complained off by the<lb/> plaintiff showed Cinestar Sunil Shetty stopping the purchasers of<lb/> Lal Dant Manjan powder. He further informed them of the ill<lb/> effects of such Lal Dant Manjan by rubbing it on the purchaser&apos;s<lb/> spectacles, which leaves marks which are termed by him as being<lb/> akin to sandpapering. He also endorses the defendant&apos;s Colgate<lb/> Tooth Powder as being 16 times less abrasive and non-damaging to<lb/> the spectacles. He also was heard telling the purchasers that it is<lb/></p>

			<p>3<lb/> . 2004 (29) PTC 401 (Del)<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> easy to change spectacles but not one&apos;s teeth. It was contended on<lb/> behalf of the Plaintiff that it had an 80 per cent share of the<lb/> ayurvedic tooth powder trade and is directly hit by this<lb/> advertisement as the principal producer, by the denigration of the<lb/> generic product Lal Dant Manjan. It was submitted on behalf of the<lb/> plaintiff that though the impugned advertisement made no direct<lb/> reference to Dabur Dant Manjan i.e. the plaintiff&apos;s product, the<lb/> visual representation in the offending advertisement leaves no<lb/> manner of doubt that the product being referred to is Lal Dant<lb/> Manjan manufactured and marketed by the plaintiff. On the other<lb/> hand, the defendant contended that the advertisement does not<lb/> identify and refer to products of the plaintiff; that it is open to the<lb/> defendant while praising its own product to point out the<lb/> defects/deficiencies in the rival product; the criticism is based on<lb/> the studies conducted in United States of America, which found<lb/> such Lal Dant Manjan tooth powder to damage tooth enamel<lb/> which was affirmed by two dentists of repute; and in any case the<lb/> defendant is prepared to drop the red container/bottle which<lb/> according to the plaintiff identifies its product. The offer made by<lb/> the defendant to drop the red container/bottle from the<lb/> advertisement was rejected by the plaintiff who insisted that even<lb/> otherwise they are entitled to an order and injunction against the<lb/> defendant from airing the said advertisement.<lb/> The Defendant relied upon the meaning of the word<lb/> disparage from Black&apos;s Law Dictionary which is set out in<lb/> paragraph 3 (k) of the judgment and reproduced hereunder:<lb/> &quot;disparage (di-spar-ij), vb. 1. Hist. To<lb/> connect unequally (e.g., to marry below one&apos;s<lb/> status). 2. To dishonor (something or<lb/> someone) by comparison. 3. To unjustly<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> discredit or detract from the reputation of<lb/> (another&apos;s property, product or business).<lb/> Disparagement (di-spar-ij-ment), n. A false<lb/> and injurious statement that discredits or<lb/> detracts from the reputation of another&apos;s<lb/> property, product, or business…...&quot;<lb/> The Learned Single Judge (Mukul Mudgal, J.), after considering the<lb/> submissions advanced by the plaintiff as well as the defendant<lb/> proceeded to hold that the law relating to generic disparagement of<lb/> a specified commodity and the entitlement of one of such<lb/> unidentified manufacturer of such decried product is settled by the<lb/> decisions of the Delhi High Court in Dabur India Ltd. Vs. Colgate<lb/> Palmolive Pvt. Ltd. (supra) and Reckitt &amp; Coleman vs. Kiwi<lb/> T.T.K. Ltd. 4 and that the Learned Judge is prima facie of the view<lb/> that the offending advertisement is clearly covered by the fourth<lb/> principle set out in the two judgments namely -slandering of a rival<lb/> product as bad is not permissible. Paragraphs 13, 19, 20 and 21 of the<lb/> said judgment are relevant and are reproduced hereunder for ready<lb/> reference.<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;13. While Mr. Rohatgi is right in submitting<lb/> that the generic disparagement was not to be<lb/> found in the judgment of the learned Single<lb/> Judge in Reckitt &amp; Coleman&apos;s case (supra)<lb/> which was followed in Dabur&apos;s case, yet I am of<lb/> the view that the position of law about generic<lb/> disparagement in Dabur&apos;s case was not only<lb/> justified but also warranted. Even if the ratio of<lb/> the two learned Single Judge&apos;s judgments of this<lb/> Court is considered to be only in respect of an<lb/></item>

			<item>4<lb/> . 1996 PTC (16) 393<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> identified product, in principle there is no<lb/> reason why the manufacturer of a<lb/> disparaged product, which though not<lb/> identified by name, cannot complain of<lb/> and<lb/> seek<lb/> to<lb/> injunct<lb/> such<lb/> disparagement.&quot; (emphasis supplied)<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;19. I am further of the view that generic<lb/> disparagement of a rival product without<lb/> specifically identifying or pin pointing the rival<lb/> product is equally objectionable. Clever<lb/> advertising can indeed hit a rival product without<lb/> specifically referring to it. No one can disparage a<lb/> class or general of a product within which a<lb/> complaining plaintiff falls and raise a defense that<lb/> the plaintiff has not been specifically identified.<lb/> In this context the plaintiff has rightly rejected<lb/> the offer of the defendant to drop the container<lb/> from its advertisement so as to avoid the averred<lb/> identification of the plaintiff&apos;s product. I must<lb/> also deal with a English judgment of Willes J<lb/> relied upon by the counsel for the defendant (for<lb/> which no citation is indicated), the entire<lb/> reasoning of which reads as under……...&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;20. The practice of undue obeisance to English<lb/> jurisprudence without any thought to the merit<lb/> and reasoning of such judicial wisdom should also<lb/> be discouraged. When there is a judgment of<lb/> Hon&apos;ble Justice Dr. M.K. Sharma directly on the<lb/> point of generic disparagement, I see no reason<lb/> why one should travel westwards for seeking<lb/> enlightenment. Similarly on the question of rival<lb/> product disparagement the Division Bench of this<lb/> Court in Pepsi Co. (supra) has also held that<lb/> defamation of the product of a rival manufacturer<lb/> cannot be done. Undeniably it is not the puffing<lb/> up of the defendant&apos;s product i.e. the Colgate<lb/> Tooth powder which can be found objectionable<lb/> but the running down of a rival product which is<lb/> the situation in the present case.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;21. The advertisement campaign on the visual<lb/> media has an immediate impact on the viewers<lb/> and possible purchaser&apos;s mind particularly when<lb/> a well-known cinestar is endorsing it…….&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>( iv) Annamalayar Agencies Vs. VVS &amp; Sons Pvt. Ltd.<lb/> &amp; Ors. 5<lb/> In this case, the grievance of the plaintiff was that the<lb/> first defendant company which manufactures VVD gold coconut<lb/> oil issued three advertisements through TV channels and thereby<lb/> disparaged the plaintiff&apos;s product namely Parachute. In the<lb/> advertisement no.1, two tender coconuts, one in green colour and<lb/> another in blue colour were shown and an actress wearing a green<lb/> dress appears on the screen and asks a question, Which is natural?<lb/> Thereafter she herself picks up a green coconut and says that the<lb/> green coconut is natural.<lb/> In the advertisement no. 2, an actress wearing a green dress picks<lb/> up one of the green coloured plastic bottles of VVD arranged on a<lb/> shelf and says this is 100% pure and natural and this is what I want.<lb/> Then the next shot shows an actress wearing a green dress in the<lb/> foreground and the lady wearing a blue saree in the background.<lb/> The lady wearing the blue saree has a blue coloured bottle in her left<lb/> hand and a VVD bottle in her right hand. She looks at the blue<lb/> bottle which is in her left hand and shakes her head disapprovingly<lb/> and puts the bottle down. Then she looks at the VVD bottle in the<lb/> 5<lb/> . 2008 (38) PTC 37 (Mad)<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> right hand and lifts the bottle up and says VVD Gold, this is what I<lb/> want.<lb/> In advertisement no. 3, which is shown in fast forward<lb/> mode, people are seen going into a supermarket where two shelves<lb/> are displayed, they pick up all the green bottles in no time and<lb/> empty the shelf which is once again refilled, while the other shelf<lb/> with the blue bottles is shown as remaining almost untouched.<lb/> The plaintiffs therein contended that the said three<lb/> advertisements are nothing but a dishonest attempt on the part of<lb/> the 1st defendant to show that the plaintiff&apos;s product is not a pure<lb/> and natural product. It was therefore a 100% disparaging attempt to<lb/> discredit the plaintiff&apos;s product. According to the plaintiff, the blue<lb/> bottle which was shown in the advertisements refers only to the<lb/> plaintiff&apos;s blue bottle, as the blue bottle shown in the<lb/> advertisements bears a bar code and only the plaintiff&apos;s blue bottles<lb/> have a bar code.<lb/> The first defendant denied that the aim of the<lb/> advertisement was to disparage the plaintiff&apos;s brand Parachute, but<lb/> submitted that the aim was to drive home the message that VVD is<lb/> 100% pure coconut oil. The 1st defendant also contended that their<lb/> advertisements do not refer to Parachute alone and it refers to all<lb/> other brands also, and most of the other brands sell their oil in blue<lb/> coloured plastic bottles. They also contended that there are at least<lb/> six other brands which have blue coloured bottles having bar code.<lb/> The Learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court<lb/> (S. Rajeswaran, J.) has, after referring to several judgments on the<lb/> issue of disparagement of products summarised the legal<lb/> principles in paragraph 29 of his Judgment which is reproduced<lb/> hereunder:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;(1) A manufacturer of a disparaged product which<lb/> though not identified by name can complain of and<lb/> seek to injunct such disparagement.<lb/></item>

			<item>(2) Generic disparagement of a rival product<lb/> without specifically identifying or pinpointing the<lb/> rival product is equally objectionable.<lb/></item>

			<item>(3) Advertisement campaign on visual media has an<lb/> immediate impact on the viewers and possible<lb/> purchasers&apos; mind particularly a well-known cinema<lb/> star is endorsing it.<lb/></item>

			<item>(4) There must be a dividing line between<lb/> statements that are actionable and those which are<lb/> not.<lb/></item>

			<item>(5) When a claim of superiority over a rival product<lb/> is made and until the same is proved by a panel of<lb/> experts, an order of interim nature should operate<lb/> against those advertisements.<lb/></item>

			<item>(6) Advertiser has a right, to boast of its<lb/> technological superiority in comparison with a<lb/> product of a competitor, however while doing so, he<lb/> cannot disparage the goods of the competitor.<lb/></item>

			<item>(7) If the Defendants highlight its better future<lb/> while comparing its product with that of the<lb/> Plaintiff in an advertisement, no possible objection<lb/> can be raised thereto.<lb/></item>

			<item>(8) Courts will injunct an advertiser from publishing<lb/> an article if the dominant purpose is to injure the<lb/> reputation of the Plaintiff.<lb/></item>

			<item>(9) The factors to be kept in mind to decide the<lb/> question of disparagement are (1) intent of the<lb/> commercial (2) manner of the commercial (3) story<lb/> line of the commercial, and (4) the message sought<lb/> to be conveyed by the commercial.<lb/></item>

			<item>(10) The degree of disparagement must be such that<lb/> it would tantamount to or almost tantamount to<lb/> defamation.<lb/></item>

			<item>(11) An advertiser can say that his product is better<lb/> than that of his rival, but he cannot say that the<lb/> rival&apos;s product is inferior to his product.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>The Learned Judge after discussing the submissions advanced on<lb/> behalf of the plaintiff as well as the defendant concluded that the<lb/> impugned advertisements are certainly causing disparagement of<lb/> the product of the Plaintiff.<lb/> Paragraphs 33, 34, 35, 36 and 37 are reproduced hereunder for ready<lb/> reference:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;33. In so far as advertisements 2 and 3 are<lb/> concerned, they definitely refer to a plain unnamed<lb/> blue bottle and drives home a message that the<lb/> blue bottle does not contain 100% pure and natural<lb/> coconut oil whereas the 1st Defendant&apos;s product<lb/> alone contain 100% pure and natural coconut oil. It<lb/> is one thing to say that the 1st Defendant&apos;s product<lb/> alone is 100% pure which is not actionable and it is<lb/> another thing to say that the Plaintiffs product is<lb/> not 100% pure which is actionable.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;34. Even though it was denied by the 1st<lb/> Defendant that they did not mean to run down the<lb/> product of the Plaintiff, it was admitted by them<lb/> that it was aimed at all the blue bottles including<lb/> that of the Plaintiff. It is also not in dispute that<lb/> only the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant are holding<lb/> the majority market share in the State of Tamil<lb/> Nadu and in such circumstances it cannot be said<lb/> that no attempt was made by the 1st Defendant to<lb/> disparage the product of the Plaintiff namely<lb/> Parachute.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;35. Even in the counter affidavit, the 1st<lb/> Defendant tries to compare its product with that of<lb/> the product of the Plaintiff by name Parachute<lb/> advanced which is not 100% pure edible grade<lb/> coconut oil. But the 1st Defendant did not come<lb/> forward with the relative merits of the Plaintiffs<lb/> product namely. Parachute 100% pure coconut oil<lb/> and its product which raises a serious doubt about<lb/> the intention of making such advertisements. It is<lb/> also not a case of the 1st Defendant that both<lb/> coconut oils were tested by a panel of independent<lb/> experts and it was proved that the 1st Defendant&apos;s<lb/> product in 100% pure coconut oil and Parachute is<lb/> not so. In such circumstances, advertisement Nos.<lb/> 2 and 3 are certainly causing disparagement of the<lb/> product of the Plaintiff.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;36. If it is an innocuous advertisement without<lb/> any intent to malign, defame and disparage the<lb/> product of the Plaintiff, then there was no<lb/> necessity of showing a blue bottle and comparing<lb/> its purity by more than one in action.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;37. The 3rd advertisement also goes to show that<lb/> the general public not picking the blue bottles<lb/> stacked in the shelf whereas the 1st Defendant&apos;s<lb/> product are being grabbed with enthusiasm and<lb/> swiftness. This definitely would send a wrong<lb/> message to television viewers and the buyer of the<lb/> coconut oil that the blue bottle products are<lb/> inferior to that of green bottle products of the 1st<lb/> Defendant, which is nothing but openly<lb/> disparaging the product of the Plaintiff.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>(v) Godrej Consumer Products Limited V Initiative Media<lb/> Advertising 6<lb/></p>

			<p>6<lb/> . 2012 (52) PTC 260 (Bom)<lb/> This is the judgment of this Court on disparagement<lb/> actions. The judgment was cited by the Plaintiff to emphasise the<lb/> general principles of disparagement even when the plaintiff&apos;s product is<lb/> not referred to by name, and to emphasis the instant and lasting effect<lb/> that a television commercial has on viewers. The facts of the case are<lb/> peculiar, since though the product of the plaintiff was not named, but a<lb/> label similar to that of the plaintiff was used. The message conveyed by<lb/> the advertisement was, that the device of the defendant was more<lb/> effective than the one already plugged in (which had a label similar to<lb/> that of the plaintiff ). In the facts of the case had it not been for the<lb/> depiction of the plaintiff&apos;s label on the product depicted in the<lb/> advertisement, the effect would have been only that of puffing and<lb/> hence the relief was moulded.<lb/> Paragraphs 18, 19 and 20 of the<lb/> judgment of the learned Single Judge (B. R. Gavai, J.) are reproduced<lb/> hereunder:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;18. It is equally settled that to decide the<lb/> question of disparagement, the following factors<lb/> are to be kept in mind:<lb/></item>

			<item>(i) Intent of commercial<lb/></item>

			<item>(ii) Manner of the commercial<lb/></item>

			<item>(iii) Storyline of the commercial and the message<lb/> sought to be conveyed by the commercial.<lb/> Out of the above, &quot;manner of the commercial&quot;, is<lb/> very important. If the manner is ridiculing or<lb/> condemning product of the competitor then it<lb/> amounts to disparaging but if the manner is only<lb/> to show one&apos;s product better or best without<lb/> derogating other&apos;s product then that is not<lb/> actionable.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;19. ……I am aware of the fact that the<lb/> comparison that has to be done should be from<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> the view point of an ordinary person of average<lb/> intelligence. Upon comparison of the labels used<lb/> on the bottles in the advertisements and the label<lb/> of the plaintiff&apos;s product, I find that the label<lb/> used in the advertisements is capable of giving<lb/> impression to the ordinary man of average<lb/> intelligence that the bottle which is initially used<lb/> in the machine is that of the plaintiff&apos;s<lb/> product….&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;20. As already discussed hereinabove, an intent<lb/> of commercial; the manner of commercial;<lb/> storyline of commercial; and the message sought<lb/> to be conveyed would be material. If the intent of<lb/> the commercial is only for the purpose of<lb/> promotion of the goods of the manufacturer, the<lb/> same would not be actionable but if the intention<lb/> of the commercial is disparaging the product of<lb/> the plaintiff, then an action would lie. From the<lb/> storyline and the manner of the advertisements in<lb/> question, it can clearly be seen that the message<lb/> that is sought to be given in the advertisements, is<lb/> that even after the machine with product<lb/> containing label alike plaintiff&apos;s product is put on,<lb/> it has no effect and the mosquitoes go on<lb/> troubling which require the person in the room to<lb/> indulge in acrobatics etc. It is to be noted that the<lb/> advertisement campaign or visual media has an<lb/> immediate impact on the viewers and possibly<lb/> purchaser&apos;s mind, particularly, when a well-<lb/>known cinestar is endorsing it. It is further to be<lb/> noted that the matter has to be looked from the<lb/> view point of the ordinary person of average<lb/> intelligence. Though the advertisements in<lb/> question may show the product having a label<lb/> alike that of plaintiff&apos;s product for a few seconds,<lb/> the possibility of the same being registered in the<lb/> mind of an average consumer and linking it with<lb/> the ineffectiveness of the product cannot be ruled<lb/> out.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>(vi)<lb/> Eureka Forbes Ltd. V Pentair Water India 7<lb/> In this case, the question before the Court was whether the<lb/> advertisement in question amounts to disparaging the product of the<lb/> appellant Company and whether the order of the trial Court suffered<lb/> from perversity, or is capricious. The Learned Single Judge of the<lb/> Karnataka High Court (V. Jagannathan, J.) held that though in the<lb/> advertisement there was no mention of the product, &apos;Aquaguard&apos; of the<lb/> Appellant, yet the advertisement viewed as a whole appears to be<lb/> generic in nature and is actionable.<lb/> Paragraphs 15 and 19 of the said decision are reproduced hereunder:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;15. .....The disparagement though not specific<lb/> in the sense that there is no mention of the word<lb/> &apos;Aquaguard&apos; , yet, taken on the whole, the<lb/> advertisement though appears to be generic in<lb/> nature, still becomes actionable and, as such, the<lb/> appellant is right in contending that the said<lb/> advertisement has affected its product.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;19. Therefore, having regard to the aforesaid<lb/> position in law, in the instant case, the<lb/> advertisement will have to be held to be a<lb/> disparaging one, even in a generic sense and<lb/> hence is actionable.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>9.<lb/> The above judgments not only categorically specify as to when a<lb/> product can be said to have been disparaged, but have also settled the<lb/> principle of law that generic disparagement of a rival product without<lb/> specifically identifying or pin pointing the rival product is equally<lb/> 7<lb/> 2007 (35) PTC 556 (Karn)<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> objectionable. In other words, no one can disparage a class of products within<lb/> which a complaining plaintiff falls and raise a defense that the plaintiff has not<lb/> been specifically identified. Even if there is no direct reference to the product<lb/> of the plaintiff and only a reference is made to the entire class of products in its<lb/> generic sense, even in those circumstances disparagement is possible.<lb/></p>

			<p>10.<lb/> With the above issues being answered, I now turn to the two impugned<lb/> TVCs of Defendant No.1, which according to the Plaintiff disparages the entire<lb/> class of frozen desserts in which category of products, the Plaintiff has a<lb/> market share of 51.3 per cent and therefore the products of the Plaintiff in this<lb/> category are also disparaged and affected. The two impugned TVCs are<lb/> annexed and marked Exhibits-H and L to the Plaint. The story board of the<lb/> impugned TVCs are reproduced hereunder:<lb/> 1st TVC:<lb/> A<lb/> The Disclaimer is in very minute print and it is impossible for any viewer to<lb/> read the same. However, the contents of the Disclaimer is reproduced<lb/> hereunder:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;FSSAI --the apex body of food safety and regulatory norms in<lb/> India defines Ice-cream as milk based product that has not less<lb/> than 10% milk fat and Frozen Dessert as Vegetable Oil based<lb/> product that has not less than 10% Vegetable oils. It also<lb/> prohibits any misguiding practices of presenting frozen desserts<lb/> as ice-creams. Vanaspati mentioned in the voice over refers to<lb/> Vegetable Oil.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>2ND TVC:<lb/> The story board of the second TVC is identical to the 1st TVC with regard to<lb/> all the above screen shots, save and except the voice over in the third last<lb/> screen shot where the word &apos;vanaspati tel&apos; is used in place of &apos;Vanaspati&apos; and<lb/> the Disclaimer in the last three screen shots also uses the word &apos;vanaspati tel&apos;<lb/> in place of &apos;vanaspati&apos;. However, the entire story board of the 2nd TVC is<lb/> reproduced hereunder :<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> The above three Disclaimers are in such small minute letters that it would be<lb/> humanly impossible for any person watching TVC-2 to read the same. However,<lb/> the Disclaimer is reproduced hereunder:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot; FSSAI -the apex body of food safety and regulatory norms<lb/> in India defines Ice-cream as milk based product that has not<lb/> less than 10% milk fat and Frozen Dessert as Vegetable Oil<lb/> based product that has not less than 10% Vegetable oils. It also<lb/> prohibits any misguiding practices of presenting frozen<lb/> desserts as ice-creams. Vanaspati Tel mentioned in the voice<lb/> over refers to Vegetable Oil.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>11. Amongst others, the main grievance of the Plaintiff with regard to the<lb/> two TVCs is that the Defendant No. 1 has in the first TVC mislead the<lb/> consumers of frozen desserts by stating that Amul Icecream contains pure milk,<lb/> whereas frozen desserts contain Vanaspati (which in common parlance is<lb/> referred to as Dalda or ghee), and which admittedly is bad for health. In the<lb/> first TVC, the Defendant No. 1 has also depicted milk flowing /overflowing in<lb/> the cup of Amul Icecream and Vanaspati / Ghee going into the cup of frozen<lb/> dessert, and has through the said TVC maligned, belittled and discredited the<lb/> entire category of frozen desserts and sought to influence the customers to<lb/> refrain from buying /consuming frozen desserts, the same not being the correct<lb/> choice. After the Plaintiff took up their grievance with the Defendant No. 1,<lb/> they substituted the word &apos;Vanaspati&apos; by &apos;Vanaspati tel&apos; in the voice over and in<lb/> the Disclaimer found in the Screen Shot Nos. 8, 9 and 10 in the 2nd TVC<lb/> reproduced above. However Defendant No. 1, as can be seen from Screen Shot<lb/> Nos. 8 and 9 of the 2nd TVC continued to show semi solid Vanaspati / ghee<lb/> going into the cup of frozen dessert. The 2nd TVC is therefore nothing but the<lb/> continuation of 1st TVC. According to the Plaintiff, Vanaspati which is<lb/> hydrogeneted vegetable oil and which is perceived to be bad for health by the<lb/> consumers, is not at all used by the Plaintiff and or Defendant Nos. 3 and 4,<lb/> who are having 70% share in the Frozen Dessert Market. It is contended by the<lb/> Plaintiff that despite this, Defendant No.1 by publication of the two impugned<lb/> TVCs are inter alia conveying to the consumers, by a negative campaign, that<lb/> all frozen desserts contain Vanaspati, and are therefore impure, unhealthy and<lb/> inferior and not the correct choice. Defendant No. 1 is therefore committing<lb/> the tort of slander of goods and injurious / malicious falsehood and by generic<lb/> disparagement of the product &apos;frozen dessert&apos; are also disparaging the goods of<lb/> the Plaintiff, which will adversely affect their presence in the market for sale of<lb/> frozen desserts.<lb/></p>

			<p>12.<lb/> According to Defendant No.1, it is perfectly lawful and legitimate for<lb/> Defendant No. 1 to state that frozen desserts contain either vanaspati or<lb/> vanaspati tel; all that is stated in the TVCs constitutes truth and the material on<lb/> record satisfies the same; the two TVCs do not in any manner disparage or<lb/> denigrate frozen desserts or constitute slander of goods as alleged by the<lb/> Plaintiff. According to the defendant no.1 they have not even shown the cup of<lb/> the plaintiff but have shown a neutral cup of frozen dessert in their<lb/> Advertisements/TVC&apos;s.<lb/></p>

			<p>13. For a better understanding of the controversy which is the subject matter<lb/> of the Suit, the statutory as also the technical difference between the two rival<lb/> categories of products involved in the matter namely ICE CREAMS and<lb/> FROZEN DESSERT is necessary. Under the FSS Regulations, ice creams and<lb/> frozen desserts are both food products classified as dairy based desserts. Ice<lb/> creams are made out of milk/milk solids. In addition to milk and/or milk solids,<lb/> fat is also required. This fat is either milk fat or vegetable fat, the other<lb/> ingredients remaining the same. Globally, a majority of icecream manufacturing<lb/> companies also use non-dairy fat and outside India these products fall within<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> the category of ice creams. As per Indian Regulations products which contain<lb/> non dairy fat are categorised as frozen desserts. Both ice creams and frozen<lb/> desserts contain milk solids but what makes them different is that in law, ice<lb/> creams must contain over 10 per cent milk fat, whereas frozen desserts must<lb/> contain over 10 per cent total fat (i.e. milk fat and/or edible vegetable oil). Rest<lb/> of the ingredients are the same.<lb/></p>

			<p>14. At this stage it is also necessary to understand the difference between<lb/> hydrogenated fat or hydrogenated vegetable oil or Vanaspati and edible<lb/> vegetable oil. The hydrogenated vegetable oil (Vanaspati) and edible vegetable<lb/> oil are not the same and both are different in the process of manufacturing,<lb/> composition and product properties. The law also distinguishes between edible<lb/> vegetable oil and hydrogenated vegetable oil. The definitions of hydrogenation,<lb/> hydrogenated vegetable oils and vegetable oils from the FSS Regulations are<lb/> reproduced hereunder:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;Hydrogenation &quot; means the process of addition of hydrogen<lb/> to an edible vegetable oil using a catalyst to produce a fat<lb/> with semi-solid consistency&quot; (emphasis supplied)<lb/> &quot;Hydrogenated vegetable oils: 1. Vanaspati means any<lb/> refined edible vegetable oil or oils, subjected to a<lb/> process of hydrogenation in any form. It shall be<lb/> prepared by hydrogenation from groundnut oil, cottonseed oil<lb/> and sesame oil or mixtures thereof or any other harmless<lb/> vegetable oils allowed by the Government for the purpose.<lb/> Refined sal seed fat, if used, shall not be more than 10 per cent<lb/> of the total oil mix....&quot; (emphasis supplied)<lb/> &quot;Vegetable oils&quot; means oils produced from oilcakes or oilseeds<lb/> or oil bearing materials of plant origin and containing<lb/> glycerides.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>It needs to be noted here that in view of the above definitions, reference to<lb/> &apos;vanaspati&apos; would mean a fat with semi solid consistency, and it is not<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> necessary to specify/clarify whilst referring to Vanaspati that it is in thick or<lb/> semi solid or solid form.<lb/></p>

			<p>15. The distinction between hydrogenated vegetable oil/Vanaspati oil and<lb/> edible vegetable oil is extremely relevant in the context of the present Suit, since<lb/> Vanaspati/hydrogenated vegetable oils are perceived to be bad for health,<lb/> whereas edible vegetable oils per se, are not. The difference between the<lb/> nutrition profile of Vanaspati and edible vegetable oil is reproduced hereunder :<lb/> Vegetable Oil (per 100g) Hydrogenated vegetable oil (per 100 g)<lb/> Energy (kcal)<lb/> 884<lb/> 884<lb/> Protein (g)<lb/> 0<lb/> 0<lb/> Carbohydrate (g)<lb/> 0<lb/> 0<lb/> Sugars (g)<lb/> 0<lb/> 0<lb/> Dietary Fibre (g)<lb/> 0<lb/> 0<lb/> Total fat (g)<lb/> 100<lb/> 100<lb/> Saturated Fat (g)<lb/> 49.3<lb/> 93.7<lb/> Mono unsaturated (g)<lb/> 37<lb/> 0.26<lb/> Poly Unsaturated (g)<lb/> 9.3<lb/> 0<lb/> Cholesterol (mg)<lb/> 0<lb/> 0<lb/> Trans fat (g)<lb/> 0.26<lb/> Sodium (mg)<lb/> 0<lb/> 6<lb/> As can been seen from the above, edible vegetable oil has lower saturated fat and does<lb/> not contain any trans-fat or cholesterol, whereas Vanaspati/hydrogenated vegetable<lb/> oil contains higher saturated fat and trans-fat and is perceived to be unhealthy.<lb/> Extracts from the literature published, inter alia, by the National Institution of<lb/> Nutrition (Dietary Guidelines for Indians, etc.) containing observations pertaining to<lb/> the effects of the saturated fat and trans-fat contained in Vanaspati are annexed as<lb/> Exhibit-J to the Plaint.<lb/></p>

			<p>16. In paragraphs 6.13 and 6.14 of the Affidavit-in-Reply to the Notice of Motion,<lb/> Defendant No. 1 itself has admitted that it is an undisputed position that Vanaspati is<lb/> harmful and have also mentioned that the Plaintiff itself has annexed at Exhibit-J to<lb/> the Plaint, the dietary guidelines which describes what Vanaspati is, and the risk of<lb/> heart disease associated with it. Defendant No. 1 in the said paragraphs further makes<lb/> a reference to the Article at running page 82 annexed to the plaint which discusses<lb/> the risk of coronary heart disease associated with Vanaspati.<lb/></p>

			<p>17. Keeping in mind that Defendant No.1, as set out hereinabove, admits<lb/> that the use of Vanaspati is harmful for health and the risk of heart disease<lb/> associated with it, let us go back to the storyline of the first impugned TVC set<lb/> out in paragraph 8 above. The same shows Shriya a young child, having a dental<lb/> problem. She visits the Dentist with her father and is shown in the Clinic,<lb/> demonstrating courage during her entire check-up, rare for children of her age.<lb/> In the voice over to screen shots F, G, H, I and J it is, inter alia, stated that<lb/> &quot;Shriya ki bahaduri ke inaam ko pure rakhna zaruri hai&quot;, &quot;Usse<lb/> real milk wala Amul ice cream khilayein&quot;, &quot;Vanaspati wala nahi&quot;,<lb/> &quot;unhe ice cream nahi frozen dessert kehte hain&quot;, &quot;ice cream word ke<lb/> liye pehle pack check karein …..real milk real ice cream Amul&quot;. (emphasis<lb/> supplied) Screen shots H and I along with the said voice over &quot;Vanaspati wala<lb/> nahi&quot;, unhe ice cream nahi frozen dessert kehta hai, also depicts two cups side<lb/> by side showing a stream of milk flowing/overflowing into the Amul product,<lb/> whereas &quot;Vanaspati&apos;&apos; i.e. semi solid product flowing into the cup of frozen<lb/> dessert. Furthermore, the product of Defendant No. 1 is shown as sparkling<lb/> white, whereas the frozen dessert equivalent is depicted by a murky yellowish<lb/> colour representing Vanaspati. By the above voice over and depiction,<lb/> Defendant No. 1 has in no uncertain terms sought to convey the message to the<lb/> consumers that Shriya needs to be given the product of the Defendant i.e.<lb/> Amul ice cream, which is pure, and she should not be given the<lb/> product which contains Vanaspati and which product is called<lb/> frozen dessert. The Defendants have therefore made a false representation<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> to the consumers and also indulged in a negative campaign that no frozen<lb/> dessert is pure, and only Amul ice cream is pure, as all frozen desserts contain<lb/> Vanaspati, and are therefore inferior. The Defendant No. 1 has laid stress on<lb/> &apos;Vanaspati&apos; clearly with a view to suggest that therefore frozen desserts are not<lb/> pure, are unhealthy and are inferior, and Amul ice cream which is made of pure<lb/> milk should be consumed and not frozen desserts. Defendant No. 1 has<lb/> therefore clearly made an attempt to influence the consumers not to buy frozen<lb/> desserts. Additionally, as the story has a child protagonist, it leaves a scare in<lb/> the minds of the viewers, who may also be parents, that Frozen Desserts are<lb/> unsafe, not fit for children and hence are not the &quot;correct choice&quot;. It certainly<lb/> leaves an impression that when a child is given frozen dessert the child is<lb/> consuming something which is full of Vanaspati. This is also in view of the<lb/> product of Defendant No.1 being shown as sparkling white, whereas the frozen<lb/> dessert is depicted with a murky yellowish colour. Though there is a Disclaimer<lb/> shown in the first TVC, in very small illegible letters inter alia stating that<lb/> &quot;Vanaspati&quot; mentioned in the voice over refers to &quot;vegetable oil&quot;, the said<lb/> representation itself is again incorrect and misleading, in view of it being<lb/> explained hereinabove, that as per the law, i.e. under the FSS Regulations,<lb/> Vanaspati cannot be equated with vegetable oil.<lb/></p>

			<p>18. The entire first TVC is therefore prepared by the Defendant No.1 to<lb/> disparage the entire category of frozen desserts by putting a scare in the mind of<lb/> the consumers that it contains Vanaspati (which is perceived as unhealthy) and<lb/> is therefore not pure, is inferior, unhealthy, not the correct choice, should not be<lb/> consumed and instead the consumers should turn to the product of the<lb/> Defendant No.1. From the case law discussed in paragraph 8 above, it is clear<lb/> that it is settled law that the manufacturer of a product whilst advertising his<lb/> product/s cannot say directly or indirectly that the product of the competitor is<lb/> bad and/or harmful. If a manufacturer indulges in such negative campaigning,<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> the same would amount to slandering of a rival product, which is not<lb/> permissible in law, and entitles any manufacturer affected by such slandering of<lb/> his product to an injunction against such negative campaigning. Thus I am<lb/> convinced that by the first TVC the Defendant No. 1 has indulged in negative<lb/> campaigning against its rival products i.e. &apos;Frozen Desserts&apos; and is therefore<lb/> guilty of generic disparagement and slander of the entire category of the &apos;Frozen<lb/> Dessert&apos; products.<lb/></p>

			<p>19. A revisit to the second TVC which is reproduced in paragraph 8 above,<lb/> makes it clear that the only change that the Defendant No. 1 made to the<lb/> first impugned TVC, was that it replaced the word &quot;Vanaspati&quot; with<lb/> &quot;Vanaspati oil/tel&quot; and commenced publication of the same on various digital<lb/> media. Save and except the above change, all the other visual and oral features<lb/> of the first impugned TVC were kept as it is in the second impugned TVC.<lb/> What is most important is the fact that no change has been made in the visual<lb/> representation of the second impugned TVC which shows Vanaspati falling<lb/> into the cup along with the voice over stating &apos;Vanaspati Tel Wala Nahi&apos; &apos;unhe<lb/> ice cream nahi frozen dessert kehte hai&apos;<lb/> thereby once again attempting to<lb/> influence the consumers of Frozen Dessert, not to consume the same on the<lb/> ground that Frozen Desserts are not pure, are unhealthy, inferior, and therefore<lb/> not the correct choice. This dominant effect is not taken away by the use of the<lb/> word &apos;tel&apos; in the voice over. The addition of the word &quot;tel&quot; therefore does not<lb/> make any difference to the intent, manner and storyline of the advertisement<lb/> taken as a whole. The Disclaimer in letters which are illegible also makes no<lb/> difference. The second TVC is therefore nothing but a continuation of the first<lb/> TVC. In this regard the decision of the Delhi High Court in the case of<lb/> Karamchand Appliances Pvt. Ltd. vs. Shri Adhikari Brothers and others 8 ,<lb/></p>

			<p>8<lb/> .<lb/> 2005 (31) PTC 1 Del.<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> wherein the Court inter alia accepted the submission of the plaintiff that the<lb/> change in the modified advertisement was so insignificant that the viewers of<lb/> the commercial would not notice the same and the viewers who had seen the<lb/> original advertisement were bound to recall the same in their memory. In its<lb/> said decision the Court has also observed that since there is no cut and dry<lb/> formula to decide whether or not the goods of a trader or manufacturer are<lb/> disparaged or not and would depend on the facts and circumstances of each<lb/> case, all that the Court need to be conscious of is that while disparagements<lb/> may be direct, clear and brazen, they may also be subtle, clever and covert.<lb/> Paragraphs 19, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 32 of the said decision are relevant and<lb/> reproduced hereunder:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;19. Two propositions clearly emerge from the above<lb/> pronouncements, namely,<lb/></item>

			<item>(1) that a manufacturer or a tradesman is entitled to boast that<lb/> his goods are the best in the world, even if such a claim is<lb/> factually incorrect, and<lb/></item>

			<item>(2) that while a claim that the goods of a manufacturer or the<lb/> tradesman are the best may not provide a cause of action to any<lb/> other trader or manufacturer of similar goods, the moment the<lb/> rival manufacturer or trader disparages or defames the goods<lb/> of another manufacturer or trader, the aggrieved trader would<lb/> be entitled to seek reliefs including redress by way of a<lb/> prohibitory injunction. Question No. 1 is accordingly answered<lb/> in the negative.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;21. Whether or not the goods of a trader or manufacturer are<lb/> disparaged would depend upon the facts and circumstances of<lb/> each case. There is no cut and dried formula, for general<lb/> application. All that the Court need to be conscious of is that<lb/> while disparagements may be direct, clear and brazen, they<lb/> may also be subtle, clever or covert. What is the statement<lb/> made by the rival trader and how it belittles, discredits or<lb/> detracts from the reputation of another&apos;s property, product or<lb/> business is the ultimate object of the judicial scrutiny in such<lb/> cases. Before I examine the rival submissions in the instant<lb/> case, I may refer to a few of cases where the Courts found the<lb/> statements to be disparaging, hence actionable.&quot;<lb/> ...<lb/> ....<lb/> ....<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;26. Coming then to the facts of the present case, the<lb/> defendant&apos;s commercial, which provoked the filing of the suit,<lb/> showed the pluggy device of the plaintiff and dubbed the same<lb/> as an obsolete 15 years old method of chasing away<lb/> mosquitoes. On a comparison with its own product the<lb/> defendant&apos;s advertisement claimed that it was the latest<lb/> machine available in the market which chased away the<lb/> mosquitoes at twice the speed. This Court&apos;s order found that<lb/> advertisement to be disparaging and restrained its telecast. In<lb/> appeal the Division Bench made a modification to the extent<lb/> that the advertisement can go on but without disparaging the<lb/> plaintiff&apos;s product. The defendant&apos;s case now is that it has<lb/> modified the advertisement and instead of showing the pluggy<lb/> device which resembled the plaintiff&apos;s machine, it has shown a<lb/> different device which has a different design and colour<lb/> combination. The plaintiff cannot, Therefore, complain of any<lb/> disparagement in the modified commercial which simply puffs<lb/> up the plaintiff&apos;s product -something that the defendant in law<lb/> is entitled to do.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;27. On behalf of the plaintiff Mr. Jaitley argued that the<lb/> change in the shape of the device, was so insignificant that the<lb/> viewers of the commercial would not even notice the same. He<lb/> relied upon the power of recall of the viewers and submitted<lb/> that the viewers having seen the original advertisement were<lb/> bound to recall the same in their memory and ... (illegible) the<lb/> plugg now being shown with the plaintiff&apos;s machine.…&quot;<lb/> &quot;28. The pluggy device which was shown in the first version<lb/> of the defendants commercial no longer appears in the<lb/> modified version in as much as the shape and the colour<lb/> combination of the device is marginally altered. The<lb/> defendant&apos;s version is that what is shown in the modified<lb/> version is a device, the design whereof is registered in its<lb/> name. In other words, the commercial does not any more show<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> the plaintiff&apos;s device or any device deceptively similar to it.<lb/> Two aspects need to be examined in that backdrop. The first is<lb/> whether the altered design of the pluggy device makes any<lb/> material difference in the matter of conveying the message<lb/> which the commercial intends to convey to the viewers. The<lb/> second aspect is whether a disparagement of a general concept<lb/> is actionable in law, if such disparagement is otherwise<lb/> unsustainable on the touchstone of any technological<lb/> advantage, which the defendant&apos;s product may be enjoying<lb/> over the product, that is, disparaged.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;29. There is considerable merit in the submission made by<lb/> Mr. Jaitley that the original advertisement, against which the<lb/> plaintiff had complained, showed a pluggy device deceptively<lb/> similar to the defendant&apos;s device, if not the very device which<lb/> the defendant manufactures and markets. The message<lb/> contained in the advertisement was that pluggy devices used as<lb/> mosquito repellents in which the defendant is the market<lb/> leader are old, obsolete and outdated method of chasing the<lb/> mosquitoes and deserve to be discarded as the lady model in<lb/> the commercial actually does so. Re-run of the same<lb/> commercial, with a slightly modified design of the device or<lb/> colour scheme, does not materially alter either the message or<lb/> the basis on which the same is being sent across. The viewers<lb/> will, in all likelihood, view the modified version also in the light<lb/> of the first version that appeared on the television networks<lb/> before it was restrained by the Court.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;30. …A disparagement even if generic would remain a<lb/> disparagement and can be restrained at the instance of a party,<lb/> who manufactures or trades in that class of goods regardless<lb/> whether the technology used is modern or obsolete. The<lb/> defendant is indeed entitled to boast that its product is the<lb/> latest in the market and even the best but it cannot describe<lb/> either the technology or the concept used by any other<lb/> manufacturer or trader in the manufacture or sale of his<lb/> products as obsolete or worthless. Comparative advertisement<lb/> is permissible, so long as such comparison does not disparage<lb/> or denigrate the trademark or the products of a competitor.<lb/> Comparison of different features of two products showing the<lb/> advantages, which one product enjoy over the other is also<lb/> permissible provided such comparison stops short of<lb/> discrediting or denigrating the other product. Viewed thus the<lb/> defendant&apos;s commercial, which shows the model in the same<lb/> taking out the pluggy device by describing it as 15 years old and<lb/> obsolete method is a clear case of disparagement of devices like<lb/> that of the plaintiff&apos;s that are based on that concept or<lb/> technology and would therefore, be impermissible.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;32. I am, Therefore, of the view that the telecast of the<lb/> modified commercial is liable to be restrained not only because<lb/> the commercial disparages the product manufactured and<lb/> marketed by the plaintiff but also because the claim made by<lb/> the defendant about any technological advantage justifying the<lb/> disparagement are not substantiated.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>20. Therefore all the observations made hereinabove qua the 1st TVC, are<lb/> also applicable to the 2nd TVC. From the content, intent, manner and storyline<lb/> of both the TVCs it is clear that Defendant No. 1 seeks to take undue advantage<lb/> of the perception of the public that Vanaspati is bad for health and creates a<lb/> false impression that all Frozen Desserts are made using Vanaspati and are<lb/> consequently not pure, inferior, bad for health and not the correct choice, i.e.<lb/> should not be consumed by the public who should instead have the product of<lb/> the Defendant No.1, i.e. ice cream. Therefore, as explained above, addition of<lb/> the words &apos;Vanaspati tel&apos; instead of &apos;Vanaspati&apos; in the 2nd TVC makes no<lb/> difference. The justification given by Defendant No.1 for using the words<lb/> &apos;vanaspati tel&apos; in the voice over and disclaimer in the 2nd TVC cannot be<lb/> accepted and is dealt with in detail in paragraph 33 hereinafter. It also needs to<lb/> be clarified that only on the basis of the words Vanaspati and Vanaspati tel used<lb/> in the TVCs, it cannot be said that the TVCs are disparaging the category of<lb/> Frozen Desserts, but since the content, intent, manner and storyline of the<lb/> impugned TVCs seen as a whole, convey a false, untruthful, malicious and<lb/> negative message, this Court is of the view that the two impugned TVCs<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> disparages the entire category of products known as Frozen Desserts of which<lb/> the Plaintiff is a market leader, thereby also disparaging the products<lb/> manufactured and sold by the Plaintiff and adversely affecting the business of<lb/> the Plaintiff. As held in the judgments set out/quoted in paragraph 8 above, the<lb/> Plaintiff is therefore entitled to impugn the two TVCs despite the same not<lb/> making any direct reference therein to the Plaintiff or the product<lb/> manufactured by the Plaintiff. Therefore, the submission of the Defendant<lb/> No.1 that they are not showing the cup of the Plaintiff in its<lb/> TVC&apos;s/advertisement but are showing a neutral cup also does not assist the<lb/> Defendant No.1 in any manner whatsoever.<lb/></p>

			<p>21. In defence of its claim that the impugned TVCs do not in any manner<lb/> defame, denigrate or slander either Frozen Desserts or the Plaintiff&apos;s products,<lb/> the Defendant No. 1 has laid emphasis on the fact that the manufacturers of<lb/> Frozen Desserts, despite the introduction of Regulation 2.1.7 in the year 2011<lb/> by the Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food<lb/> Additives) Regulations, 2011, separately classifying ice creams and Frozen<lb/> Desserts under the larger head -&quot;Dairy based deserts/confections&quot;, continued<lb/> to describe the product as ice creams thereby violating Section 53 of the<lb/> FSSA, 2006. In order to educate the members of the public, Defendant No. 1<lb/> commenced an advertisement campaign explaining the distinction between ice<lb/> creams and Frozen Desserts and the impugned TVCs are nothing but an<lb/> extension of the said campaign.<lb/></p>

			<p>22. Defendant No. 1 have sought to contend that since for the first time in<lb/> 2011--12 the FSS Regulations brought about the distinction between ice creams<lb/> and frozen desserts, they commenced advertisement campaigns from the year<lb/> 2012. This contention is incorrect. As pointed out by the Plaintiff, the true fact<lb/> is that the distinction between frozen desserts and ice creams existed even prior<lb/> to 2011-12. The distinction was first introduced on 7th June, 2005 by an<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> amendment to the Regulations framed under the Prevention of Food<lb/> Adulteration Act, 1954, the relevant extract of which was tendered in Court by<lb/> the Advocate for the Plaintiff. Entry A.11.02.07.02 pertains to frozen<lb/> dessert/frozen confection and is identical to the present provision under the<lb/> FSS Regulations. However, in the years 2012-2013, Defendant No. 1 did start a<lb/> campaign by distribution of pamphlets setting out the difference between<lb/> Frozen Desserts and ice creams. However, it is important to note that<lb/> Defendant No.1 in their Hindi as well as English pamphlets distributed from<lb/> 2012-2013 onwards always used<lb/> the words &quot;vegetable oil&quot; and not<lb/> &quot;Vanaspati&quot;or &quot;Vanaspati tel&quot;. The said pamphlets are reproduced hereunder:<lb/> It is further important to note that Defendant No.1 has in the said pamphlets<lb/> not only not used the words vanaspati or vanaspati tel but even the reference<lb/> to vegetable oil is also not in relation to all Frozen Desserts generally as a<lb/> category, but to most of them ( &apos;JYADATAR&apos;). It is only in the TVCs which<lb/> are introduced in March, 2017 by Defendant No. 1, that Defendant No. 1<lb/> started use of the words Vanaspati and Vanaspati tel. The pictorial depiction of<lb/> Vanaspati falling into the cup of Frozen Dessert, also arose for the first time in<lb/> the TVCs which are introduced in March, 2017. It is obvious that this is so<lb/> since Defendant No.1 was well aware that Vanaspati being perceived as a health<lb/> hazard, its mention as an ingredient in the Frozen Dessert would scare the<lb/> consumers from having Frozen Desserts, who would then turn to the product<lb/> of Defendant No. 1 i.e. ice cream.<lb/></p>

			<p>23. Any campaign to educate the members of the public by placing before<lb/> them the true and correct facts/ingredients used in a product should always be<lb/> welcomed. However, no manufacturer can place misleading information before<lb/> the consumers qua the product of his rivals and thereby<lb/> disparage/discredit/belittle such product including influencing the consumer<lb/> not to buy the same in the garb of educating and/or bringing the correct facts<lb/> before the members of the public, as is done in the present case by Defendant<lb/> No.1. Apart from educating the consumers qua the difference in products by<lb/> mentioning the correct facts and following the legal route, action can also be<lb/> taken against the manufacturers of products, if they are found violating Section<lb/> 53 of the FSSA, 2006 as alleged by the Defendant No.1. The aforesaid excuse<lb/> /reason given by Defendant No.1 therefore lacks justification and is rejected.<lb/></p>

			<p>24. Defendant No. 1 has contended that on a true and correct viewing of the<lb/> TVCs, the following position emerges:<lb/></p>

			<item>(i)<lb/> As reward for Shreya&apos;s confidence and valour displayed through her<lb/> dental treatment, the doctor suggests the parent to give Shreya an ice cream;<lb/></item>

			<item>(ii)<lb/> Since there is purity in Shreya&apos;s courage, the advertisement suggests the<lb/> parent to give Shreya an ice cream;<lb/></item>

			<item>(iii) What is made out of Vanaspati and Vanaspati Tel is not ice cream but<lb/> frozen dessert. Hence the consumer ought to check the packaging of the<lb/> product to identify, whether it is ice cream or frozen dessert.<lb/></item>

			<item>(iv) Lastly TVCs recommend Amul Ice cream to the consumer.<lb/></item>

			<p>Defendant No. 1 has contended that the Plaintiff&apos;s suggestion that frozen<lb/> dessert is shown in murky yellowish colour; is depicted as unhealthy or inferior;<lb/> or shown as lacking in purity is equally incorrect. The suit TVCs only show<lb/> frozen dessert for what they are as containing &apos;Vegetable Tel&apos; which they do.<lb/> The legend on the packaging of the generic frozen dessert is magnified to show<lb/> that frozen dessert contains vegetable oil. Hence there is no falsehood, slander<lb/> or defamation.<lb/></p>

			<p>25. In my view this is an over simplification of the TVCs. The intent,<lb/> storyline, manner of depiction , effect and impact of the TVCs of Defendant<lb/> No. 1 is certainly not what is stated by Defendant No. 1. The TVCs are not<lb/> innocuous as asserted by Defendant No. 1. The storyline, manner of depiction,<lb/> effect and impact of the TVCs has been dealt with hereinabove.<lb/></p>

			<p>26. Defendant No. 1 has contended that the terms &quot;Vanspati&quot; or &quot;Vanaspati<lb/> Tel&quot; per se are not defamatory words. It is not even the Plaintiff&apos;s case, that<lb/> they are defamatory in a secondary sense. On the contrary, both &quot;Vanaspati&quot;<lb/> and &quot;Vanaspati Tel&quot;are recognized food ingredients. In fact, any milk based<lb/> frozen dessert or confection containing either Vanaspati or Vanaspati Tel in law<lb/> would be termed as frozen dessert.<lb/> As set out hereinabove, it is the case of Defendant No. 1 itself in its reply that<lb/> Vanaspati is harmful to health. The Plaintiff has also pleaded that. The<lb/> substitution of the word Vanaspati with Vanaspati Tel in the second TVC makes<lb/> no difference as dealt with in paragraph nos. 19, 20 and 33 of this order.<lb/> Further, the words cannot be considered in isolation but the TVCs have to be<lb/> considered in its entirety including the visuals. This contention of Defendant<lb/> No. 1 is devoid of merits.<lb/></p>

			<p>27. The Defendant No. 1 has also laid emphasis on the statement made by<lb/> the Plaintiff in the plaint that, &quot; In fact, a majority of the manufacturers of ice-<lb/>creams with non-dairy fat i.e. frozen desserts i.e. 70 % of manufacturers of ice-<lb/>creams with non-dairy fat (which constitutes the Plaintiff, Defendant No. 3 and<lb/> 4) do not use hydrogenated fat or hydrogenated vegetable oil ordinarily known<lb/> as vanaspati&quot; and have contended that the Plaintiff has therefore admitted that<lb/> 30 per cent of the manufacturers of Frozen Dessert are using Vanaspati in the<lb/> manufacture of Frozen Dessert. Apart from the fact that Defendant No. 1 by its<lb/> impugned TVCs have given an incorrect impression to the consumers that 100<lb/> per cent manufacturers of Frozen Dessert use Vanaspati/hydrogenated<lb/> fat/hydrogenated vegetable oil, by no stretch of imagination, it can be<lb/> concluded /held from the above statement in the plaint that the Plaintiff has<lb/> admitted that 30 per cent of the manufacturers of Frozen Dessert use<lb/> hydrogenated fat or hydrogenated vegetable oil, ordinarily known as Vanaspati.<lb/> The Plaintiff has approached this Court with a case that the Defendant No. 1 is<lb/> guilty of generic disparagement of the product known as Frozen Dessert by,<lb/> inter alia, through the TVCs, wrongly informing the consumers that all Frozen<lb/> Desserts contain Vanaspati, despite the fact that the Plaintiff (who is a market<lb/> leader qua Frozen Desserts along with Defendant Nos. 3 and 4 have 70 per cent<lb/> share in the<lb/> Frozen Desserts market, and do not use Vanaspati in Frozen<lb/> Desserts. The Plaintiff has only conveyed this and no further. The question<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> therefore of the Plaintiff having admitted that 30% or any per cent of the<lb/> manufacturers of Frozen Desserts are using Vanaspati or hydrogenated<lb/> vegetable oil in the manufacture of Frozen Desserts does not arise. Since the<lb/> Defendant No. 1 in their Affidavit-in-Reply incorrectly interpreted the<lb/> aforestated statement of the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff was constrained to explain in<lb/> their Rejoinder that their statement in the plaint only meant that the Plaintiff<lb/> and the Defendant Nos. 3 and 4 constituting 70 per cent of the manufacturers<lb/> of Frozen Desserts do not use Vanaspati. The said clarification therefore cannot<lb/> be construed as the Plaintiff having changed its stand in its Rejoinder. In my<lb/> view, even if 30 per cent of the manufacturers of Frozen Desserts use<lb/> Vanaspati, Defendant No. 1 is not entitled to convey by way of any statement or<lb/> depiction that the entire category of Frozen Dessert manufacturers, or in any<lb/> event a majority of them, are using Vanaspati in the manufacture of Frozen<lb/> Dessert.<lb/></p>

			<p>28. The Defendant No. 1 in support of its contention that the manufacturers<lb/> are using Vanaspati in their product has produced photographs of two products<lb/> viz. &apos;LAZZA&apos; and &apos;HERITAGE&apos;. The photograph of the third party product<lb/> &apos;LAZZA&apos; does not show Vanaspati/hydrogenated vegetable oil as an ingredient.<lb/> The only product that Defendant No. 1 has sought to portray which uses edible<lb/> hydrogenated vegetable fat is at page 267 of the Defendant&apos;s compilation.<lb/> Defendant No. 1 has not provided any details as to what is the market share of<lb/> the said product allegedly sold under the mark &quot;Heritage&quot;. In any event as the<lb/> saying goes &apos;one swallow does not a summer make&apos;, a single product cannot<lb/> justify the depiction of the entire category of Frozen Desserts as having<lb/> Vanaspati. The Defendant ought to have discharged the burden of<lb/> demonstrating that the entire class of products known as Frozen Desserts<lb/> contain Vanaspati, failing which the Impugned TVCs are not only false but also<lb/> disparaging. In my view, the Plaintiff is correct in its submission that where the<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> contention of Defendant No. 1 is that all Frozen Dessert (or at least 30%)<lb/> manufacturers are using Vanaspati and Defendant No. 1 seeks to rely upon such<lb/> an assertion to contend that as the truth and as a defence to the present action,<lb/> the principles analogous to those laid down in Pidilite Industries Ltd. v<lb/> S.M. Associates and Ors. 9 would be applicable and Defendant No. 1 should<lb/> then demonstrate with sufficient material that its assertion is in fact true. It is<lb/> not sufficient to show only one packaging of one manufacturer alone, without<lb/> showing any other material like the extent of sale, market share, availability of<lb/> product throughout India etc. Paragraphs 52, 53, 54, 57 and 58 of the said<lb/> Judgment are reproduced hereunder for ready reference:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;52. As far as use of the word &quot;Seal&quot; as a suffix is<lb/> concerned, Dr.Shivade was actually pressing into service<lb/> the series theory. According to him, as various traders<lb/> use the word &quot;Seal&quot; as a suffix just as the Plaintiff does,<lb/> there would be no likelihood of confusion or deception.<lb/> According to him, traders and the public have gained<lb/> such knowledge of the common element or<lb/> characteristics of the series &quot;that when they meet another<lb/> mark having the same characteristic they will<lb/> immediately associate the later mark with the &quot;series&quot; of<lb/> marks with which they are already familiar.&quot; The<lb/> principle on which the series theory is based is that the<lb/> consumer being aware of the fact that there are several<lb/> marks with the common element will pay attention to the<lb/> other features, thereby negating the possibility of any<lb/> doubt/confusion.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>53. &quot;It is important to note at the outset that other than<lb/> annexing cartons bearing the aforesaid marks with the<lb/> suffix &quot;seal&quot;, there is no evidence produced as to its actual<lb/> use much less the extent of its use. In paragraphs 26, 27<lb/> and 28 of the affidavit in rejoinder, the Plaintiff has<lb/> categorically denied the existence of the said brands &quot;A-<lb/></item>

			<item>9<lb/> .<lb/> 2004 (28) PTC 193 (Bom.)<lb/> Seal&quot; &quot;Inn-Seal&quot; &quot;Jam-Seal&quot; &quot;Max-Seal&quot;. The Plaintiff<lb/> has further stated that the brands are not in use much less<lb/> in continuous or extensive use. It is further denied that<lb/> the colour scheme is used by most of the manufacturers.<lb/> An affidavit in sur-rejoinder has been filed. Significantly,<lb/> the first Defendant has even in the sur-rejoinder not<lb/> furnished any evidence of actual use or the extent of such<lb/> use.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>54. &quot;The Supreme Court in Corn Products v. Shangrila<lb/> Food Products, AIR 1960 Supreme Court 142 dealt with<lb/> this question. In that case, it was contended that there<lb/> were various trade marks with a prefix or suffix &quot;Gluco&quot;<lb/> or &quot;Vita&quot; and that made it impossible to say that the<lb/> common features &quot;Gluco&quot; or &quot;Vita&quot; were associated<lb/> only with the Appellants products. The submission was<lb/> based on a passage from Kerly on Trade Marks, (7th<lb/> Edition, page 624) to the effect that where there are a<lb/> series of marks registered or unregistered having a<lb/> common feature or a common syllable if the marks in the<lb/> series are owned by different persons, this tends to assist<lb/> the Applicant for a mark containing the common<lb/> feature……&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>57. I am unable to accept the submission that the ratio<lb/> consisted of accepting the submission on behalf of the<lb/> Defendant that the judgment of the Supreme Court in<lb/> Corn Products would only be applicable to a matter<lb/> decided at the final hearing after evidence is led. The<lb/> above extract itself indicates that the learned Judge<lb/> accepted as sufficient at the interim stage, the evidence<lb/> produced before him to establish prima-facie that several<lb/> marks with the suffix &quot;Sprin&quot; were in fact in use. It is<lb/> difficult to read the judgment as having held that though<lb/> at the trial proof of extensive use of the series of marks is<lb/> required at the interim stage it is not.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>58. &quot;The fallacy of this submission lies in the<lb/> misconception that the issue to be proved is different at<lb/> different stages of legal proceedings. Whatever the stage<lb/> of the proceedings, the issue to be proved or the content<lb/> of the proof remains the same. It is the level of proof that<lb/> varies depending on whether the order sought is at the<lb/> interim stage or at the final hearing.<lb/></item>

			<item>The judgment in Corn Products requires the Defendant<lb/> to prove that the marks must be not merely in use but in<lb/> &quot;extensive use&quot;. Thus, even in interim proceedings, it is<lb/> not sufficient merely for the Defendant to show prima-<lb/>facie that there is some user of the marks. There must be<lb/> prima facie evidence to show extensive use. At the final<lb/> hearing of the suit the level of proof required is higher -<lb/>the matter requiring to be proved viz. &quot;extensive or<lb/> substantial use&quot; remaining the same.<lb/></item>

			<item>For instance, in a given case, a Defendant may well<lb/> establish conclusively in interlocutory proceedings that<lb/> there was actual use of the marks in the market. He<lb/> would thus have fulfilled the first requirement viz. actual<lb/> use. He may however candidly admit that the extent of<lb/> use is minimal. The Defendant could not in such<lb/> circumstances resist an injunction on the series argument<lb/> contending that at the interim stage the extent of use is<lb/> not material.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>29. The Defendant No.1 has contended that the aforesaid Judgment cannot<lb/> be relied upon in the present context since the same relates to an action for<lb/> infringement /passing off of trade marks. This submission of Defendant No.1<lb/> cannot be accepted. Defendant No.1 has sought to generalize Frozen Desserts<lb/> and has sought to contend that all Frozen Desserts contain Vanaspati. In<lb/> support of this, Defendant No.1 has sought to rely upon one isolated box of one<lb/> isolated manufacturer. The Judgment is sought to be relied upon to show that in<lb/> circumstances where a party seeks to contend that a certain state of affairs is<lb/> general and applicable to large number of players in the field, it should<lb/> substantiate the same with material to show that such manufacturers are<lb/> actually in the market and the extent of sales of such manufacturers. Relying on<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> some stray solitary box, it is not open to a party to generalize a certain state of<lb/> affairs to all others in that field of activity. I am therefore in agreement with the<lb/> submission on behalf of the Plaintiff that the Judgment and the principles<lb/> analogous to those set out therein are apt and applicable to the present case.<lb/></p>

			<p>30. It is also contended on behalf of Defendant No. 1 that it is for the<lb/> Plaintiff to point out that all manufacturers of Frozen Desserts are not using<lb/> Vanaspati/hydrogenated vegetable oil as an ingredient in any of the Frozen<lb/> Desserts. I am not in agreement with the submission since the present Suit is in<lb/> the nature of an action for generic disparagement /slander of goods for the<lb/> category of dairy based products referred to as Frozen Desserts. The grievance<lb/> of the Plaintiff is that by conveying to the consumers by way of the impugned<lb/> TVCs that all Frozen Desserts contain Vanaspati/hydrogenated vegetable oil<lb/> Defendant No. 1 is disparaging the entire category of Frozen Desserts which<lb/> affects the Plaintiff&apos;s products considering the fact that they are the market<lb/> leaders in that category of products. It is therefore enough for the Plaintiff and<lb/> its supporting Defendants to show that they do not use Vanaspati in their<lb/> Frozen Desserts and they cannot be called upon to prove/establish as to who are<lb/> the manufacturers of Frozen Desserts who are using Vanaspati/hydrogenated<lb/> vegetable oil.<lb/></p>

			<p>31. Defendant No.1 has in support of its contention that it has not<lb/> disparaged the category of Frozen Desserts in any manner also laid emphasis<lb/> on the fact that the modified advertisement (Second Impugned TVC) uses<lb/> &quot;Vanaspati TEL&quot; in the voice over which is the term used to define &quot;vegetable<lb/> oil&quot; in the Hindi version of FSS Regulations. It is submitted that the Oxford<lb/> Dictionary also shows the translation of Vanaspati TEL as Vegetable Oil.<lb/> Accordingly, the advertisement being in Hindi, the use of the term is justified<lb/> and the impugned TVCs reflect the truth.<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>32. At the cost of repetition I once again clarify that it is not only because of<lb/> the words &apos;Vanaspati&apos; and &apos;Vanaspati tel&apos; being used in the impugned TVCs,<lb/> that this Court has come to the conclusion that Defendant No. 1 is guilty of<lb/> disparaging the entire category of Frozen desserts which includes the products<lb/> manufactured by the Plaintiff under the said category, but the Court has<lb/> reached the said conclusion after considering the content, intent, manner and<lb/> storyline of the impugned TVCs, which seen as a whole convey a false,<lb/> untruthful, malicious and negative message that frozen desserts contain<lb/> vanaspati (which is perceived as unhealthy) are not pure, are inferior to ice<lb/> creams, not meant to be given to children, is not the right choice and should<lb/> not be purchased.<lb/></p>

			<p>33. As stated earlier, Defendant No. 1 in all its past communications and<lb/> even in its Hindi Pamphlets, has referred to Frozen Dessert products as having<lb/> &quot;vegetable oil&quot; and not &apos;vanaspati tel&apos;&apos;. The Defendant&apos;s own compilation at<lb/> page 248 demonstrates this. The word &quot;Vanaspati&quot; or &quot;Vanaspati Tel&quot; has<lb/> never been used earlier in the context of vegetable oils and is for the first time<lb/> used in the Impugned TVCs. This demonstrates that to the knowledge of the<lb/> Defendant No.1, vegetable oil is normally referred to as &quot;vegetable oil&quot; and not<lb/> as &apos;vanaspati&apos; or &apos;vanaspati tel&apos; and the consumers also do not refer to vegetable<lb/> oil as Vanaspati or Vanaspati Tel. The authoritative text of the FSS Regulations<lb/> is admittedly in English. However, Defendant No. 1 in March, 2017, chose to<lb/> use the Hindi version of the FSS Regulations. As correctly stated by the<lb/> Plaintiff, if Defendant No. 1 was so insistent on using Hindi terms in the<lb/> advertisement, Defendant No. 1 would have described frozen dessert as &quot;Shitit<lb/> Misthan&quot; which would be the Hindi equivalent of Frozen Dessert. The intent<lb/> of Defendant No. 1 was to disparage and also get an unjustified advantage by<lb/> associating the ill effects of Vanaspati with all Frozen Desserts generally and to<lb/> mislead and scare the consumers. The Defendant No. 1 first used the word<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> Vanaspati instead of vegetable oil in the first impugned TVC with a misleading<lb/> disclaimer, and thereafter when objected to by the Plaintiff changed the word<lb/> Vanaspati to Vanaspati tel in an attempt to confuse the public and to also create<lb/> a scare in them qua the Frozen Dessert product by retaining the word<lb/> &apos;Vanaspati&apos; and continuing with the depiction of vanaspati flowing into the cup<lb/> of frozen dessert. It is necessary to go back to the Screen Shots G &amp; H of the<lb/> first impugned TVC and Screen Shots 7 and 8 of the second impugned TVC<lb/> with the voice over, &quot; Usse real milk wala Amul ice cream khilayein&quot;<lb/> &quot;Vanaspati tel wala nahi&quot; and note that Defendant No. 1 in both the TVCs<lb/> whilst comparing the ingredient &apos;milk&apos; in ice creams with &apos;vegetable oil&apos; in<lb/> Frozen Desserts, is using the English word &quot;milk&quot; and not &quot;doodh&quot; in Hindi for<lb/> its ice cream, but is going out of its way to use the Hindi terms<lb/> Vanaspati/Vanaspati tel instead of the word vegetable oil as an ingredient of<lb/> Frozen Dessert. This shows to what extent Defendant No. 1 is straining its<lb/> every nerve to use the term &apos;vanaspati&apos; in the garb of informing /educating the<lb/> consumers about the difference between the two products, only so that by the<lb/> word &apos;Vanaspati&apos; itself, the consumer will get scared and stay away from<lb/> Frozen Desserts. Therefore, as correctly submitted by the Plaintiff, the<lb/> substitution of the word &quot;Vanaspati&quot; with &quot;Vanaspati tel&quot;, would not in any<lb/> manner alter the situation. The second TVC is a continuation of the first TVC.<lb/> The mind of the public having been fixed from the first TVC that Frozen<lb/> Desserts contain Vanaspati, the addition of the word &quot;tel&quot;, is in any event<lb/> inconsequential and does not alter the situation. Further, in any event, the<lb/> addition of the word &quot;tel&quot; is meaningless when the visual representation which<lb/> is the prominent and the most effective part in both the TVCs, does not show<lb/> edible vegetable oil which is not in solid form, going into the cup of frozen<lb/> dessert, and instead shows a thick (semisolid) Vanaspati going into the cup of<lb/> the Plaintiff. This is a complete giveaway of the fact that the addition of &quot;tel&quot;<lb/> and the reliance on the translations is not a sustainable defence. The Plaintiff is<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> therefore correct in contending that the impugned TVCs do not reflect the<lb/> truth as alleged by the Defendant No.1 and the decisions relied upon by the<lb/> Plaintiff in this regard viz. Lakhanpal National Limited vs. M.R.T.P.<lb/> Commission and another 10 and Gorbatschow Vodka K.G. vs. John Distilleries<lb/> Limited 11 support the contention of the Plaintiff.<lb/></p>

			<p>34. Defendant No. 1 has next submitted that the Plaintiff has suppressed the<lb/> following material facts in the plaint:<lb/></p>

			<p>(i) The true facts, in relation to the ASCI Complaint/s, the fact that the<lb/> Plaintiff&apos;s complaints were not upheld, and that the Suit TVCs raise the same<lb/> issues and make out the same distinction between ice creams and Frozen<lb/> Desserts;<lb/></p>

			<p>(ii) That the Plaintiff, Defendant Nos. 3 and 4 and other manufacturers of<lb/> Frozen Desserts (who constitute a class) are indulging in false and misleading<lb/> advertisements and attempting to project Frozen Desserts as ice cream;<lb/></p>

			<p>(iii) That the 2011 Regulations (Hindi version) statutorily term &apos;vegetable oil&apos;<lb/> as Vanaspati Tel. Equally, the Plaintiff has failed to state that even in common<lb/> parlance, the dictionary meaning of &apos;vegetable oil&apos; is &apos;Vanaspati Tel&apos;. This non-<lb/>disclosure is material, since it is the main thrust of the Plaintiff&apos;s case that the<lb/> use of the word &apos;Vanaspati&apos; disparages and denigrates Frozen Desserts (as a<lb/> class).<lb/></p>

			<p>(iv) That the pre-suit correspondence is not disclosed. A perusal of the same<lb/> would show that the Plaintiff had no issue with the visual depiction of the<lb/> TVCs and it found only the use of the word &apos;Vanaspati&apos;, objectionable.<lb/> It is therefore submitted on behalf of the Defendant No.1 that the Plaintiff<lb/> being guilty of concealment of material facts, ought to be denied relief by the<lb/> 10<lb/> (1989) 3 SCC 251<lb/> 11<lb/> 2011 (47) PTC 100 (Bom)<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> Court. In support of its submission, Defendant No. 1 has relied on the<lb/> decisions of the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in Dalip Singh vs. State of Uttar<lb/> Pradesh 12 and Oswal Fats and Oils Limited vs. Additional Commissioner<lb/> (Administration) Bareily Division, Bareilly &amp; Ors. 13<lb/></p>

			<p>35. As regards the allegation of suppression qua the ASCI complaints, it is<lb/> submitted on behalf of the Plaintiff that in view of what is inter alia stated by<lb/> them in paragraph 16 of the plaint, it cannot be said that they have suppressed<lb/> any facts pertaining to the issues before the ASCI. It is further submitted that<lb/> the impugned TVCs are independent and distinct and give rise to a separate,<lb/> distinct, independent cause of action; the impugned advertisements were never<lb/> the subject of any ASCI proceedings and have no connection whatsoever to any<lb/> of the previous ASCI proceedings; no ASCI Complaint has been filed in respect<lb/> of the impugned TVCs and there is no ruling in relation to the impugned TVCs<lb/> by the ASCI; the impugned TVCs therefore have to be considered on their own.<lb/></p>

			<p>35.1<lb/> I have considered the submissions of the parties qua the ASCI<lb/> complaints and the documents relied upon by them. It is true that complaints<lb/> and counter complaints were earlier filed by the Plaintiff and Defendant No. 1<lb/> before the ASCI. On certain issues ASCI upheld the correctness of the<lb/> objections raised by the Plaintiff, and on some issues it did not. Where the<lb/> ASCI has asked the Plaintiff to correct itself, the Plaintiff has done so. In fact<lb/> ASCI in response to a complaint from the Plaintiff, had earlier also directed<lb/> Defendant No. 1 not to claim in its advertisements that, &quot;Ice creams are a<lb/> complete food easy to digest and full of energy&quot;. The Plaintiff has in paragraph<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> 16 of the Plaint made a mention of the complaints/counter complaints and has<lb/> also craved leave to refer to and rely upon the proceedings before the ASCI, if<lb/> necessary, inter alia, &quot;with a view to avoid any allegations of<lb/> suppression&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<p>35.2 In any event, as can be seen from the Pamphlets reproduced at pages 46<lb/> and 47 of this Order that Defendant No. 1 in the past has never used the words<lb/> &apos;Vanaspati&apos;/&apos;Vanaspati Tel&apos; in its advertisement but has always referred to the<lb/> same as vegetable oil even in Hindi. Furthermore, reference to &apos;vegetable oil&apos;<lb/> was also not in relation to all Frozen Desserts generally as a category but to<lb/> most of them --&apos;jyadatar&apos;. The Plaintiff is therefore correct in its submission<lb/> that the use of the word &apos;Vanaspati&apos; and the pictorial depiction of Vanaspati<lb/> falling into the cup of Frozen Desserts has arisen for the first time in the<lb/> impugned TVC aired in March, 2017; that Defendant No.1 has in its TVCs for<lb/> the first time sought to convey through the voice over a negative message to the<lb/> consumers not to purchase Frozen Desserts by referring to Vanaspati along<lb/> with the visual of Vanaspati falling in the cup of Frozen Dessert; that the<lb/> Impugned TVCs are independent and distinct and give rise to a separate,<lb/> distinct and independent cause of action; the impugned advertisements were<lb/> never the subject of any ASCI proceedings and have no connection whatsoever<lb/> to any of the previous ASCI proceedings; no ASCI complaint has been filed in<lb/> respect of the Impugned TVCs and there is no ASCI ruling in relation to the<lb/> Impugned TVCs; the Impugned TVCs are different and distinct from the<lb/> earlier advertisements; the words Vanaspati/Vanaspati Tel as well as the visual<lb/> representations complained of, have been used for the first time by Defendant<lb/> No.1; the Impugned TVCs therefore have to be considered on their own.<lb/></p>

			<p>35.3 It is therefore clear that it cannot be said that the Plaintiff has in the<lb/> plaint suppressed relevant facts qua the ASCI complaints. It will also not be out<lb/> of place to mention here that the Defendant No. 1 who in its Affidavit-in-Reply<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> is now trying to give utmost importance to ASCI, its proceedings and its<lb/> rulings, has as late as on 9th September, 2016, through its Chief Operating<lb/> Officer whilst confirming that they have long back modified the leaflet (trade<lb/> pamphlet) complained of by the Plaintiff, inter alia, recorded that, &quot;we wish<lb/> to reiterate that we are not living in a banana republic where<lb/> Kangaroo Courts conducted by Companies like ASCI Ltd. can<lb/> give motivated rulings without understanding the subject and<lb/> overlooking the interest of the consumers.&quot; The Defendant No. 1 is<lb/> therefore blowing hot and cold as per its convenience.<lb/></p>

			<p>36. As regards the allegation that the plaint does not disclose that the<lb/> Plaintiff, Defendant Nos. 3 and 4 and other manufacturers of Frozen Desserts<lb/> are indulging in false and misleading advertisements and are attempting to<lb/> project Frozen Desserts as ice cream, the same is vehemently denied by the<lb/> Plaintiff. However, as stated earlier, even if the above allegations made by<lb/> Defendant No. 1 are true, the Defendant No. 1 in the garb of<lb/> educating/informing the public qua the ingredients of Frozen Desserts is not<lb/> entitled to mislead the consumers by directly or indirectly conveying to them<lb/> that all Frozen Desserts contain Vanaspati. This is done by Defendant No. 1 by<lb/> expressly using the term Vanaspati in its first TVC, along with the visual of<lb/> Vanaspati being poured into the cup containing Frozen Dessert and changing<lb/> the word Vanaspati to Vanaspati tel in the second TVC but continuing to show<lb/> the visual of Vanasapati being poured into the cup of Frozen Dessert coupled<lb/> with the negative message not to purchase Frozen Dessert by saying,<lb/> &quot;...Vanaspati wala nahi unhe frozen dessert kehtey hain&quot;. Again, as stated<lb/> earlier, if the Plaintiff or any of the manufacturers of Frozen Desserts are<lb/> indeed indulging in false representations, the Defendant No. 1 can in addition to<lb/> portraying the correct facts in its advertisements, also proceed to take action<lb/> against them for violation of Section 53 of FSSA, 2006. The allegation of<lb/> suppression therefore cannot be accepted.<lb/></p>

			<p>37. As regards the allegation that the Plaintiff has not mentioned in the<lb/> plaint that the 2011 Regulations (Hindi version) statutorily term &apos;vegetable oil&apos;<lb/> as &apos;vegetable tel&apos; and the dictionary meaning of &apos;vegetable oil&apos; is &apos;vanaspati tel&apos;, it<lb/> is pertinent to mention here that the Plaintiff has not approached this Court<lb/> only with a grievance that the Defendant No. 1 has used the words<lb/> &apos;Vanaspati/Vanaspati tel&apos; in its TVCs. The Plaintiff has moved this Court<lb/> contending that the content, intent, manner and story line of the Impugned<lb/> TVCs seen as a whole convey a false, untruthful, malicious and negative<lb/> message and it is wrongful and deceiving to suggest to the consumers that a<lb/> product which is compliant with the food laws of the country, is a wrong choice,<lb/> and that only Amul&apos;s product is the right choice. The Plaintiff has correctly<lb/> contended that the cumulative effect of the visual depiction as well as the<lb/> spoken words, disparages the category of products known as Frozen Desserts to<lb/> the effect that they are not pure, not meant to be given to children, contain only<lb/> Vanaspati (which is perceived as unhealthy), should not be purchased, etc.,<lb/> which specifically disparages and denigrates the entire category of products<lb/> known as Frozen Desserts -of which the Plaintiff is a market leader, therefore<lb/> the same directly affects, disparages and denigrates the Frozen Dessert<lb/> products of the Plaintiff, causing special damage to the Plaintiff. The change in<lb/> the second TVC from the word &apos;vanaspati&apos; to &apos;vanaspati tel&apos; does not make<lb/> difference and is a continuation of the first TVC and that both the TVCs are<lb/> disparaging the product frozen dessert is explained/set out in paragraph nos.<lb/> 19, 20 and 33 of this order. Again a person watching a television commercial is<lb/> not expected to sit with a dictionary. The allegation of suppression is therefore<lb/> untenable.<lb/></p>

			<p>38. The submission of Defendant No. 1 that the Plaintiff has not disclosed<lb/> the pre-suit correspondence in the Plaint which would have shown that the<lb/> Plaintiff had no issue with the visual depiction of the TVCs and it found only<lb/> the use of the word &apos;Vanaspati&apos;&apos; objectionable cannot be accepted and I am in<lb/> agreement with the Plaintiff that the submission of the Defendant No.1 is<lb/> untenable, unfair and clutches at straws. The email issued by the Plaintiff to the<lb/> Defendant No.1 prior to the filing of the Suit on 5 March 2017 protested against<lb/> the First Impugned TVC. Vanaspati was mentioned in the advertisement as<lb/> well as shown in the visual. The email dated 5 March 2017 cannot be treated as<lb/> a protest only against the word used in the voice over. The correspondence was<lb/> not in the nature of a correspondence between lawyers, but between top level<lb/> management personnel of the respective parties. It was an email request made<lb/> by the Plaintiff&apos;s Executive Director to Defendant No. 1&apos;s Managing Director.<lb/> These emails are not in the nature of legal notices. The email cannot by any<lb/> means be read as an acceptance by the Plaintiff of the depiction of Vanaspati in<lb/> the visual. Again, the pre-suit emails between the top level management<lb/> personnel of the Plaintiff and Defendant No.1 cannot be read as any estoppel or<lb/> waiver by the Plaintiff of any grievance made by them in the present Suit. In<lb/> fact, the Managing Director of the Defendant No. 1 has, in his correspondence<lb/> with the Executive Director of the Plaintiff tried to draw support for using the<lb/> word &apos;Vanaspati Tel&apos; by relying on the Google dictionary. The Managing<lb/> Director has not made any mention about the Hindi version of the FSSA<lb/> Regulations or to the Oxford Dictionary wherein the meaning ascribed to the<lb/> word &apos;vegetable oil&apos; is &apos;vanaspati tel&apos;. However, it would be ridiculous to<lb/> contend or to hold that since in the correspondence the Managing Director of<lb/> Defendant No. 1 has not made any mention to the Hindi version of FSSA<lb/> Regulations, 2011 and/or to the Oxford Dictionary, the same cannot now be<lb/> relied upon by Defendant No. 1 for the first time in its Affidavit-in-Reply. I am<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> therefore in agreement with the submission of the Plaintiff that the Defendant<lb/> No. 1, by such submissions, is only trying to clutch at straws.<lb/></p>

			<p>39.<lb/> I am therefore of the view that the Plaintiff cannot be held guilty of<lb/> suppression of any facts or documents as alleged by the Defendant No.1. The<lb/> decisions relied upon by Defendant No. 1 in support of its case that the Plaintiff<lb/> has suppressed material facts and documents therefore does not lend any<lb/> assistance to Defendant No.1.<lb/></p>

			<p>40.<lb/> Defendant No.1 has submitted that the Suit is essentially a class action<lb/> and the same is apparent from the Plaintiff&apos;s averments in paragraphs 2, 19, 21,<lb/> 24, 25, 26, 28 to 30 and 33 of the Plaint; It is the Plaintiff&apos;s consistent case that<lb/> Defendant No.1 is through the Suit TVCs disparaging the entire class of<lb/> products viz. the Plaintiff is the market leader (for Frozen Desserts) and as such<lb/> its reputation is also being injured; It is only since the Suit is a class action that<lb/> the Plaintiff has joined Defendant Nos. 3 and 4 as parties having common<lb/> interest -being manufacturers of Frozen Desserts /same class of products. On<lb/> this basis Defendant No. 1 has contended that the requisite pleadings necessary<lb/> to sustain class action are missing in the plaint. It is also contended that this<lb/> being a class action, the plaintiff is required to bear the burden of all the<lb/> members of the class and since there are members of the class who use<lb/> Vanaspati and the members of the class are indulging in misleading<lb/> advertisement, the action must fail.<lb/> The Plaintiff has disputed that the present Suit filed by the Plaintiff is a class<lb/> action and has submitted that this submission on behalf of the Defendant No. 1<lb/> is based on a complete misreading and misunderstanding of the complaint filed<lb/> by the Plaintiff and the nature of action initiated in the present proceedings. I<lb/> am in agreement with the Plaintiff that the Plaintiff has nowhere contended that<lb/> this is a class action filed by the Plaintiff in its representative capacity<lb/> representing the entire class of manufacturers of Frozen Desserts. The case of<lb/> the Plaintiff is that the impugned TVCs disparage the entire class of Frozen<lb/> Desserts to which the Plaintiff belongs and as a result of generic disparagement<lb/> of Frozen Desserts, the Plaintiff being market leader, is also disparaged and the<lb/> business of the Plaintiff is affected. The action is one based on a generic<lb/> disparagement of a class and cannot be confused with the class action in a<lb/> representative capacity. Since the Defendant No. 1 in its TVCs has inter alia<lb/> sought to convey to the consumers that all Frozen Desserts contain Vanaspati,<lb/> the Plaintiff joined two more players in the field to the Suit only for the purpose<lb/> of pointing out that the Plaintiff along with Defendant Nos. 3 and 4 has a 70 per<lb/> cent share in the market of Frozen Desserts and they do not use Vanaspati and<lb/> for no other reason.<lb/></p>

			<p>41. It is also submitted by the Defendant No. 1 that the plaint repeatedly<lb/> avers that Frozen Desserts contain vegetable oil and as such are healthier than<lb/> ice creams. In view of this averment, a Suit filed on the ground of alleged<lb/> disparagement of Frozen Desserts ought to be dismissed.<lb/> As stated earlier, the Plaintiff has come to this Court with a grievance that the<lb/> content, intent, manner and story line of the Impugned TVCs seen as a whole,<lb/> convey a false, untruthful, malicious and a negative message (that for the<lb/> manufacture of Frozen Desserts, Vanaspati is used and therefore they are not<lb/> pure, not meant to be given to children and should not be purchased, etc.),<lb/> which disparages and denigrates the entire category of products known as<lb/> Frozen Desserts, of which Plaintiff is the market leader. In order to show that<lb/> the said TVCs convey a false, untruthful, malicious and negative message, the<lb/> Plaintiff has in Exhibit-M to the plaint set out the nutritional information of the<lb/> Plaintiff&apos;s KWALITY WALLS product with that of the first Defendant&apos;s Amul<lb/> Ice cream, to point out that the product of the Plaintiff is not only at par with<lb/> Defendant No.1&apos;s ice cream products in all aspects of nutrition, but it is in fact<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> healthier to the extent that it has no trans fat whatsoever and has less content of<lb/> saturated fat than found in the product of Defendant No.1, and therefore the<lb/> attempts of Defendant No. 1 to disparage the Frozen Dessert category of<lb/> products and create a scare in the minds of the consumers is false and<lb/> malicious. The Plaintiff is justified in making these submissions, and the<lb/> submission on the part of Defendant No. 1 that in view of the Plaintiff having<lb/> made the aforestated averment, it cannot be heard to say that its products have<lb/> been disparaged, cannot be accepted and is rejected.<lb/></p>

			<p>42. The Defendant No. 1 has next contended that it is settled law that (i)<lb/> pleadings in a defamation case are liable to be strictly construed; (ii) the entire<lb/> charge including innuendos are required to be expressly and explicitly pleaded;<lb/> and (iii) if the plaint does not contain any facet of the defamatory charge, the<lb/> same is not liable to be considered for the purposes of grant of any reliefs. In<lb/> support of this submission, Defendant No. 1 has relied on the decisions of the<lb/> Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in M. Zakharia Sait vs. T.M. Mohammed and others 14 ,<lb/> the decision of the Calcutta High Court in W. Hay and others vs. Aswini<lb/> Kumar Samanta 15 and the decision of this Court in Essel Infraprojects Ltd. vs.<lb/> Devendra Prakash Mishra and others 16 It was extensively argued on behalf of<lb/> Defendant No. 1 that the present action being in the nature of defamation, it is<lb/> mandatory for the Plaintiff to plead and prove that on viewing the impugned<lb/> TVCs the public would relate to the Plaintiff.<lb/></p>

			<p>43.<lb/> It has rightly been pointed out by the Plaintiff that the legal<lb/> requirements of a personal defamation case and that of malicious falsehood and<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> slander of goods are distinct and different. An action for slander of goods will<lb/> lie where the defendant falsely and maliciously publishes words concerning the<lb/> plaintiff&apos;s goods and where the publication causes the plaintiff to suffer special<lb/> damages. Paragraphs 274, 275, 277 at pages 137, 138 and 140 respectively of<lb/> Halsbury&apos;s Laws of England (Fourth Edition) Volume 28 are in this regard<lb/> relevant and reproduced hereunder:<lb/> &quot;Page 137 Para274 &quot;Malicious or Injurious falsehood. At<lb/> common law an action will lie for written or oral falsehoods<lb/> which are published maliciously and are calculated in the<lb/> ordinary course of things to produce, and do produce, actual<lb/> damage. Such an action is not one of libel or of slander, but an<lb/> action for damage wilfully and intentionally done without lawful<lb/> occasion or excuse. At common law special damage is always<lb/> necessary, but this rule has been modified by statute.<lb/> Page138 para 275 &quot;Comparison with Defamation -Actions for<lb/> malicious falsehood are in a category of their own and are quite<lb/> distinct from actions for defamation. These actions are not<lb/> concerned with injury to reputation. In an action for defamation,<lb/> to establish cause of action, the plaintiff must prove that the<lb/> words referred to him and bore a meaning defamatory of him.<lb/> To establish his action in an action for slander of title or slander<lb/> of goods or other malicious falsehood, the plaintiff must prove<lb/> that the words were false, that they were published maliciously<lb/> and unless covered by the statutory exceptions, that they caused<lb/> special damage.&quot; (emphasis supplied)<lb/> Page 140 para 277 -&quot;Slanderof goods -An action for slander of<lb/> goods will lie where the defendant falsely and maliciously<lb/> publishes words of and concerning the plaintiff&apos;s goods and<lb/> where the publication causes the plaintiff to suffer special<lb/> damages.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>44. The entire contention of Defendant No. 1 that the present action is in the<lb/> nature of defamation and as such it is mandatory for the Plaintiff to plead and<lb/> prove that on viewing the Impugned TVCs the public would relate the same to<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> the Plaintiff, is based on a complete misunderstanding of the nature of<lb/> proceedings filed by the Plaintiff. The Judgments relied upon by Defendant<lb/> No. 1 are those relating to personal defamation of an individual or entity and not<lb/> relating to slander of goods or malicious falsehood. The above extract from<lb/> Halsbury&apos;s Law of England cited hereinabove clearly brings out this distinction.<lb/> This has in fact been emphasised in another Judgment relied upon by<lb/> Defendant No.1 that is Reckitt Benckiser (India) Limited vs. Naga Limited &amp;<lb/> Ors. 17 wherein it has been observed as under:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts draws a distinction between<lb/> malicious prosecution and defamation, in that &quot;defamation<lb/> protects the Plaintiff&apos;s reputation, while malicious<lb/> falsehood protects the Plaintiff&apos;s interest in his property or<lb/> trade&quot;. In its chapter on Libel and Slander, American<lb/> Jurisprudence, Second Edition Volume 50 declares that -<lb/>&quot;Generally, publication of any false and malicious statement<lb/> which tends to disparage the quality, condition, or value of<lb/> the property of another, and which causes him special injury<lb/> or damage, is actionable… &quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>45. The decision in the case of De Beers Abrasive Products Ltd. and Others<lb/> v International General Electric Co. of New York Ltd. and Another 18<lb/> differentiates between an action for defamation and slander of goods as follows :<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;I shall now briefly notice the cases that have been cited to<lb/> me on this point in chronological order, noting, however,<lb/> before I do so, that, in so far as any of them refer to or may<lb/> have depended upon the absence of a claim in respect of<lb/> special damage, this, since section 3 of the Defamation Act<lb/> 1952, is now wholly irrelevant; no such averment is now<lb/> necessary in a claim for slander of goods or injurious<lb/> falsehood or whatever label one chooses to place upon this<lb/> particular tort.<lb/></item>

			<item>The first case cited to me was Evans v. Harlow (1844) 5 Q.B.<lb/> 624. That case is, I think, a difficult case, but I think it is a<lb/> difficult case solely because the pleadings were in some<lb/> considerable muddle, and it is a little difficult to get out of<lb/> them and the judgments what the real point at issue was;<lb/> but, as I understand that case, the real point was that the<lb/> plaintiff was suing for a libel -that is to say, an ordinary<lb/> libel upon him personally -and, in order to prove that libel,<lb/> the only matter to which he could point was statements<lb/> made about the goods which he was selling. Undoubtedly,<lb/> one of the statements made about the goods that he was<lb/> selling was the rather specific one that &quot;… the tallow is<lb/> wasted instead of being effectually employed as professed&quot;<lb/> (see p. 627). But what the court decided there, in<lb/> contradistinction to what the House of Lords decided in a<lb/> later case which I shall consider later, Linotype Co. Ltd. v.<lb/> British Empire Type-Setting Machine Co. Ltd. (1899) 81<lb/> L.T. 331, was that the allegation that the plaintiff was selling<lb/> ineffective machines was not a personal libel upon him; and<lb/> it was on that ground that the court said that there was no<lb/> case to answer. However, one of the judges, Patteson J., did<lb/> go on to consider the position under what we would now call<lb/> slander of goods. He says, at the conclusion of his judgment,<lb/> 5 Q.B. 624, 633:<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;This is not, in effect, a caution against the<lb/> plaintiff as a tradesman in the habit of selling<lb/> goods which he knows to be bad; if it were, it<lb/> would be a libel upon him personally: but it is a<lb/> caution against the goods, suggesting that the<lb/> articles which the plaintiff sells do not answer<lb/> their purpose; which is not actionable unless it<lb/> were shown that the plaintiff, by reason of the<lb/> publication, was prevented from selling his goods<lb/> to a particular person;&quot;<lb/> that is to say, unless special damage was shown.<lb/> So that, although at first blush that case would make one<lb/> think, if read hastily, that it was perfectly all right for the<lb/> defendant to have said that &quot;the tallow was wasted instead<lb/> of being effectually employed as professed,&quot; once the true<lb/> explanation of that case is appreciated it in fact really does<lb/> not assist us in the present case at all. That my explanation<lb/> of that case is not merely my own appears quite clearly from<lb/> the judgment of Cozens-Hardy M.R. in Griffiths v. Benn<lb/> (1911) 27 T.L.R. 346, where he adopts precisely the same<lb/> sort of approach to it.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>46. It has been contended on behalf of Defendant No. 1 that (i) pleadings in a<lb/> defamation case are liable to be construed strictly (ii) the entire charge<lb/> including innuendos are required to be expressly and explicitly pleaded; and (iii)<lb/> if the plaint does not contain any facet of the defamatory charge, the same is not<lb/> liable to be considered for the grant of any relief. The Defendant No. 1 has<lb/> submitted that the details and particulars of the defamatory material and its<lb/> effect are not set out in the plaint. As pointed out by the Plaintiff, each of the<lb/> contentions of the Plaintiff have been particularised in the plaint with precision<lb/> as under :<lb/></p>

			<p>(i)<lb/> The impugned TVCs are annexed and marked as Exhibits-H at page 256,<lb/> Exhibit-L at page 87 of the plaint, Exhibit-G at page 55 and Exhibit-K at page 86<lb/> of the plaint. The story board of the first Impugned TVC is annexed and<lb/> marked as Exhibit-H at page 56 of the plaint and story board of the second TVC<lb/> is annexed and marked as Exhibit-L at page 87 onwards of the plaint.<lb/></p>

			<p>(ii)<lb/> Amongst other paragraphs, paragraphs 19, 20, 21, 22, 24 to 32 point out<lb/> how the Impugned TVCs are maliciously disparaging the entire category of<lb/> Frozen Desserts, thereby also disparaging the products of the Plaintiff falling in<lb/> the category of Frozen desserts.<lb/></p>

			<p>(iii)<lb/> In Paragraph 19 of the Plaint, it is averred that the first Impugned TVC<lb/> treats all Frozen Desserts as containing Vanaspati and also depicts the same by<lb/> showing Vanaspati going into the cup containing Frozen Desserts.<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> (iv) In Paragraph 20 of the plaint, it is interalia contended that the first<lb/> Impugned TVC makes a false assertion and portrays a false message in a<lb/> malicious manner viz. &quot;All frozen desserts contain only vanaspati.&quot; &quot;Ice-creams<lb/> use whole milk whereas all frozen desserts necessarily use only vanaspati.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;Consumers should not eat frozen desserts since they contain vanaspati and are<lb/> not ice creams and should check label for &quot;ice-cream&quot; word before purchasing;<lb/> Frozen desserts are unhealthy since they contain vanaspati&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<p>(v) In Clause (b) of paragraph 21 of the Plaint, it is averred that the visual and<lb/> oral representation in the first Impugned TVC that Vanaspati is used by all<lb/> manufacturers in their frozen desserts is false and incorrect.<lb/></p>

			<p>(vi) In Clause (e) of paragraph 21 of the Plaint, it is averred that the<lb/> Disclaimer in the first TVC seeks to confuse the term Vanaspati with edible<lb/> vegetable oil and seeks to give a false impression that Frozen Desserts are not<lb/> permitted to and/or do not use milk fat.<lb/></p>

			<p>(vii) In paragraph 22 it is averred that the only change that Defendant No. 1<lb/> made to the First Impugned TVC is that it replaced the word &quot;vanaspati&quot; with<lb/> &quot;vanaspati oil&quot; and commenced publication of the same on various digital<lb/> media. The said change is completely inconsequential and does not in any<lb/> manner change the false message conveyed by the First impugned TVC.<lb/></p>

			<p>(viii) In Paragraph 24 of the Plaint, it is averred that the imputations made in<lb/> the Impugned TVCs are directed not only at the entire category of products<lb/> classified by law as &quot;Frozen Desserts &quot; but also towards the KWALITY<lb/> WALL&apos;S products of the Plaintiff and, in any event, can safely be treated as<lb/> directed at the products/ Frozen Desserts of the Plaintiffs having regard to the<lb/> fact that they control more than 50% of the market share thereof.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>(ix) In Paragraph 25 of the Plaint, it is alleged that Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 are<lb/> attempting to and continue to mislead the consumers by the claims and visuals<lb/> as set out above whereby they are led to believe that all Frozen Desserts are<lb/> made only out of &apos;Vanaspati&apos; whereas in fact that is absolutely incorrect.<lb/></p>

			<p>(x)<lb/> In paragraph 28 of the Plaint, it is averred that the impugned TVCs are<lb/> patently designed by the Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 to mislead the public into<lb/> believing that entire class of products being frozen desserts of which the<lb/> Plaintiff is a market leader with its KWALITY WALL&apos;s products, are of poor<lb/> quality and unhealthy/unfit for consumption.<lb/></p>

			<p>(xi) In paragraph 32 of the Plaint, it is averred that the impugned TVCs have<lb/> the effect of seriously debasing and tarnishing the entire class of product<lb/> (frozen dessert) of which the Plaintiff is the market leader and owns over 50%<lb/> market share and is a malicious attempt to erode the equity and goodwill and<lb/> reputation of such products. Use of the impugned TVCs by Defendant No. 1 is<lb/> wrongful, illegal, fraudulent, reckless and malicious and results in tarnishing<lb/> and disparaging the product category as a whole and in particular the<lb/> KWALITY WALL&apos;S product of the Plaintiff.<lb/></p>

			<p>(xii) In Paragraph 33 of the Plaint, it is averred that the impugned TVCs make<lb/> false statements/representation/suggestions as a fact, that all Frozen Desserts<lb/> contain Vanaspati, are unhealthy, impure and should not be consumed.<lb/></p>

			<p>(xiii) In Paragraph 37 of the Plaint, it is averred that by reason of the aforesaid<lb/> wrongful and illegal acts and misconduct of the Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 in<lb/> telecasting and/or broadcasting and/or publishing the impugned TVCs, the<lb/> Plaintiff has also suffered special damages. Further there is every likelihood that<lb/> the Plaintiff has suffered or is likely to suffer loss of sales of its said product.<lb/></p>

			<p>47. However, the Defendant No.1 has submitted that the Plaintiff has not<lb/> made a mention of the following in the Plaint, but has mentioned the same in<lb/> the Rejoinder thereby completely shifting and expanding its case in rejoinder :<lb/></p>

			<p>(i)<lb/> that the Defendant No.1 has falsely sought to portray in the first<lb/> Impugned TVC that all Frozen Desserts products are made using only<lb/> Vanaspati which is solid in form/nature as opposed to edible vegetable oil which<lb/> is not solid in form or nature.<lb/> The above contention of Defendant No. 1 cannot be accepted. The<lb/> Plaintiff as set out hereinabove, has repeatedly averred in the plaint that the<lb/> Defendant No.1 has falsely sought to portray in the Impugned TVCs that all<lb/> Frozen Dessert products are made using only Vanaspati. From the definition of<lb/> hydrogenated vegetable oil/Vanaspati and vegetable oil reproduced in paragraph<lb/> 13 above, it is clear that Vanaspati is in semi solid form. Therefore elaboration of<lb/> the same by the Plaintiff in its Rejoinder by stating that the Defendant No. 1 has<lb/> falsely portrayed that the Frozen Dessert products are using Vanaspati which is<lb/> solid in form/nature as opposed to edible vegetable oil which is not solid in form<lb/> or nature, cannot be treated as the Plaintiff having completely shifted or<lb/> expanded its case in the Rejoinder.<lb/></p>

			<p>(ii)<lb/> That the Plaintiff in the Rejoinder has sought to clarify that its statement<lb/> in the plaint does not mean that the remaining 30 per cent of the manufacturers<lb/> necessarily use Vanaspati, but only means that the Plaintiff is not aware of the<lb/> product composition of the balance 30 per cent of the manufacturers who may<lb/> also not be using Vanaspati at all.<lb/> The Plaintiff has only sought to clarify a misreading of the plaint by<lb/> Defendant No. 1. This contention of the Defendant No. 1 is already dealt with<lb/> in paragraph nos. 27 to 29 of this Order and need not be repeated.<lb/></p>

			<p>(iii) That by the Suit TVCs, Defendant No. 1 in its depiction has sought to<lb/> falsely show and suggest that the Plaintiff&apos;s products contain Vanaspati and do<lb/> not contain milk at all.<lb/> As set out hereinabove, the Plaintiff has in the plaint stated [paragraphs 20, 25<lb/> (viii)] that the Defendant No. 1 has falsely sought to portray that the Frozen<lb/> Desserts contain<lb/> only Vanaspati. It is thereby obviously implied that<lb/> Defendant No. 1 has sought to portray that frozen desserts does not contain<lb/> anything except vanaspati. In view thereof, the statement of the Plaintiff in the<lb/> rejoinder that Defendant No.1 has falsely sought to suggest that the Plaintiff&apos;s<lb/> products contain vanaspati and do not contain milk at all cannot be termed as<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> the Plaintiff having completely shifted and/or expanded its case in the<lb/> Rejoinder.<lb/></p>

			<p>(iv) That the reference to Vanaspati Tel from the 2011 Regulations (Hindi) is<lb/> merely an afterthought/cover up.<lb/> Since the Managing Director of the Defendant No. 1 had, whilst dealing with<lb/> the reference to Vanaspati Tel relied on the Google Dictionary and had not<lb/> made any reference to the 2011 Regulations (Hindi) with regard to the use of<lb/> the words Vanaspati Tel in the second TVC which Defendant No. 1 has<lb/> mentioned in its reply, the Plaintiff has in the Rejoinder contended that the<lb/> same is merely an afterthought/cover up. This cannot be treated as the<lb/> Defendant shifting or expanding its case in the Rejoinder.<lb/></p>

			<p>(v)<lb/> That despite the use of the word Vegetable Oil, the Suit TVCs convey a<lb/> false message that Frozen Dessert contain Vanaspati and no milk. Defendant<lb/> No. 1 in its reply laid stress on the words &apos;Vegetable Oil/Vanaspati Tel&apos;. In the<lb/> rejoinder, the Plaintiff has referred to the depiction in the snap shots in the first<lb/> TVC and the second TVC which shows thick/semi solid Vanaspati going into<lb/> the cup of Frozen Dessert and have therefore submitted that a false message is<lb/> conveyed that Frozen Desserts contain Vanaspati and no milk. This action<lb/> cannot be termed as the Plaintiffs having completely shifted or expanded its<lb/> case in the Rejoinder.<lb/></p>

			<p>(vi) That the Disclaimer contents are false, since Frozen Desserts are not<lb/> defined as &apos;vegetable oil based products&apos;.<lb/> As regards the Disclaimers, this Court has taken cognizance of the fact that the<lb/> Disclaimers are in such small prints that none watching the TV can read the<lb/> Disclaimers with the naked eye and further, in the first TVC though the voice<lb/> over clearly suggests that all the Frozen Desserts contain Vanaspati, in the<lb/> Disclaimer which is illegible, it is sought to be stated that Vanaspati means<lb/> vegetable oil, which statement is incorrect to the knowledge of the Defendant<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> No. 1, in view of the definitions set out in paragraph 8 above, pertaining to<lb/> hydrogenated/vanaspati and vegetable oil.<lb/> I am therefore, of the view that all the required averments are found in the<lb/> Plaint and it cannot be said that the Plaintiff have tried to shift or expand their<lb/> case in the Rejoinder as alleged.<lb/></p>

			<p>48. Relying on the decisions in: (i) Procter &amp; Gamble Home Products Pvt.<lb/> Ltd. vs. Hindustan Unilever Ltd. 19 ; (ii) Phillips India Pvt. Ltd. vs. Shree Sant<lb/> Kripa Appliances Pvt. Ltd. 20 (iii) Reckit Benckiser (India) Ltd. vs. Naga<lb/> Limited &amp; Ors. 21 ; (iv) Godrej Sara Lee Ltd. vs. Reckitt Benckiser (I) Ltd. 22 ; (v)<lb/> Dabur India Ltd. vs. Colortek Meghalaya Pvt. Ltd. 23 ; (vi) Marico Limited vs.<lb/> Adani Wilmar Ltd. 24 ; (vii) Phillips India Pvt. Ltd. vs. Shree Sant Kripa<lb/> Appliances Pvt. Ltd. (supra); (viii) Havells India Ltd. vs. Amritanshu Khaitan<lb/> and Ors. 25 ; (ix) Procter &amp; Gamble Home Products Pvt. Ltd. vs. Hindustan<lb/> Unilever Ltd. 26 , and Dabur India Ltd. vs. Colortek Meghalaya Pvt. Ltd. 27 ,it is<lb/> submitted on behalf of the Defendant No.1 as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>(i)<lb/> Advertisement and/or commercial speech is a part of the fundamental<lb/> right guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution of India;<lb/></p>

			<p>(ii) It is open for an advertiser to puff (even incorrectly) its own products and<lb/> also to compare only a select or a particular attribute, feature or characteristics<lb/> of the product with that of its competitor. It is in law not necessary for the<lb/> advertiser to either depict all the other factors or characteristics of the product,<lb/> or to show any advantages of the competitors product;<lb/></p>

			<p>(iii) Whilst considering television advertisements, a frame by frame and/or<lb/> over elaborate analysis of the advertisement is to be avoided. Advertisements<lb/> (more particularly, competitive ones) are to be seen from the perspective of an<lb/> aware and &apos;alert consumer of goods;<lb/></p>

			<p>(iv) If the purpose of the advertisement is to make the consumer aware of his<lb/> mistaken impression, or correct a wrongful impression then the Plaintiff cannot<lb/> be heard to complain of such an action.<lb/></p>

			<p>(v)<lb/> In cases of comparative advertising, it is permissible to term one&apos;s own<lb/> products as better than one of its competitor. Equally, the right to protect one&apos;s<lb/> own reputation, is not to be misunderstood as a right not to be spoken against<lb/> or a right to be criticized for one&apos;s own shortcomings. In such cases, the Court<lb/> has to bear in mind that the consumer is vigilant, aware of his rights, and in<lb/> cases of comparative advertisement is likely to be more analytical in analyzing<lb/> the comparison thoughtfully and having a piecemeal review of the product<lb/> attributes;<lb/></p>

			<p>(vi) For a Plaintiff to establish a case of generic disparagement, it has to be in<lb/> a position to demonstrate that either the class or the product reflected in the<lb/> impugned advertisement is that of the Plaintiff or that the Plaintiff&apos;s product is<lb/> synonymous or associated with the class, that any reference to a product in that<lb/> class would evoke only the Plaintiff&apos;s product in the mind of the consumers;<lb/> and<lb/></p>

			<item>NMSL-690/2017<lb/></item>

			<item>(vii) As long as the advertisement is by and large truthful, the advertiser must<lb/> be given enough latitude and room to play around in the grey areas of<lb/> advertisement and the plaintiff ought not to be hypersensitive.<lb/></item>

			<p>49. It cannot be disputed that advertisements and/or commercial speech is a<lb/> part of the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (a) of the<lb/> Constitution of India. However, it cannot be that the fundamental right so<lb/> guaranteed under the Constitution can be abused by any individual and/or<lb/> manufacturer of a product by maligning, discrediting and/or belittling the<lb/> product of another manufacturer by way of negative campaign as is done in the<lb/> present case. It is also correct that it is open for an advertiser to puff up its<lb/> own products and also to compare only a select or a particular attribute, feature<lb/> or characteristic of the product with that of its competitor. However, the<lb/> instant case is not that of a mere puff up of its product by the Defendant No.1.<lb/> As set out hereinabove, Defendant No. 1 has knowingly denigrated the entire<lb/> category of Frozen Desserts thereby also affecting the Plaintiff who is a market<lb/> leader of the products falling under the category of Frozen Desserts. The<lb/> present case is also not in the nature of permissible comparative advertisements<lb/> in the true, proper and fair sense. This is because Defendant No. 1 shows an<lb/> ingredient going into Frozen Desserts, which ingredient most Frozen Desserts<lb/> do not contain at all i.e. vanaspati. In particular, the Plaintiff&apos;s Frozen Dessert<lb/> does not contain any Vanaspati. This cannot be comparative at all. Also, even<lb/> in a permitted comparative advertisement the same corresponding feature of<lb/> the product must be compared and not a totally different feature, as is done in<lb/> the present case i.e. milk is compared with Vanaspati/Vanaspati Tel, instead of<lb/> comparing the &apos;fat&apos; used in both the products.<lb/></p>

			<p>50. It cannot be said that in the instant case the Plaintiff is analysing the<lb/> Impugned TVCs frame by frame. The Impugned TVCs have to be viewed as<lb/> television commercials and not print advertisements. The plaintiff even before<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> the commencement of arguments placed the TVCs for viewing by the Court. It<lb/> is essential to see/view the whole Impugned TVCs and consider what they<lb/> convey. The impugned TVCs, seen as a whole, convey to the public clearly by<lb/> content, intent, manner and meaning that Vanaspati in large quantity goes into<lb/> Frozen Desserts. This is shown by the Vanaspati falling into the cup in the<lb/> visual in both the impugned TVCs seen together with the voice overs. In fact,<lb/> it is Defendant No. 1 who wants this Court to ignore the visual impact and<lb/> consider only the evidently insignificant addition of the word &quot;Tel&quot;. Defendant<lb/> No.1 seeks to dissect the advertisement, its visual portions and its voice over by<lb/> trying to explain only the addition of the word Tel whilst not dealing with the<lb/> visual and its impact at all. In fact, no justification is given by the Defendant<lb/> No. 1 as to why they originally showed Vanaspati and use the term Vanaspati in<lb/> the TVC. It is only after the effect and impact of the visual and the voice over is<lb/> considered that this Court has come to the conclusion that both the TVCs are<lb/> disparaging in nature. As already held hereinabove, it is clear beyond any doubt<lb/> that if the purpose of the advertisement is not to make the consumer aware of<lb/> his mistaken impression, or correct a wrongful impression and therefore the<lb/> Plaintiff can certainly be heard to complain of such an action. The TVCs of<lb/> Defendant No. 1 cannot be said to be truthful and therefore giving any latitude<lb/> and room to play around in the grey areas of advertisement to the Defendant<lb/> No. 1 does not arise nor can it be said that the Plaintiff ought not to be<lb/> hypersensitive.<lb/></p>

			<p>51. The Defendant No. 1 has contended that the consumer is informed,<lb/> analytical and an alert consumer. This is more so, in case of comparative<lb/> advertising. It is wholly misconceived to contend that the depiction in the<lb/> TVCs would make the consumer believe that frozen dessert contains only<lb/> Vanaspati or Vanaspati Tel. The ingredients are written on the pack and the<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> consumer has eaten both ice cream and frozen dessert and knows what he<lb/> wants.<lb/> The effect and impact of the TVCs have been dealt with hereinabove. On<lb/> viewing the TVCs and considering them in their entirety, I do not think that<lb/> even an alert average consumer of dairy based desserts would consider the<lb/> TVCs in the manner stated by Defendant No. 1. The TVCs surely convey a<lb/> message which has been dealt with hereinabove and result in disparagement of<lb/> frozen desserts.<lb/></p>

			<p>52. The Judgments cited on behalf of the Defendant therefore do not in any<lb/> manner show any change in the law. The legal principles continue to be the<lb/> same and that Defendant No. 1 is not entitled to denigrate the products of<lb/> another is clearly borne out by each of the Judgments cited on behalf of<lb/> Defendant No.1 on disparagement. The Judgment in the case of Procter &amp;<lb/> Gamble vs. Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (supra) does not take into consideration<lb/> some of the principles set out in the earlier Judgments, and in particular does<lb/> not take into consideration the difference between disparagement/ malicious<lb/> falsehood/ slander of goods/ and defamation, and therefore with utmost<lb/> respect I do not intend to follow the same.<lb/></p>

			<p>53. The Plaintiff has correctly distinguished the Judgments relied upon by the<lb/> Defendant No. 1 and set out in paragraph 47 above, as summarised hereunder:<lb/></p>

			<p>(i) Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd. vs Naga Limited &amp; 28 Ors<lb/> The present case is not one where Defendant No. 1 is seeking to correct<lb/> a mistaken impression of the consumer as set out in para 7 of the Judgment.<lb/> Defendant No. 1 has not produced any material to show that the consumer has a<lb/> mistaken impression. In fact it is Defendant No. 1 that is seeking to give the<lb/> 28<lb/> .ILR 2003 I Delhi 325<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> consumer a mistaken and misleading impression that all Frozen Desserts<lb/> contain Vanaspati, and this is impermissible.<lb/> The reliance placed on the orders of ASCI referred to in paragraph 8 of the said<lb/> Judgment is baseless. In the said case, the ASCI order pertained to the same<lb/> commercial and not in the context of some other commercial. In any case, as set<lb/> out hereinabove in the present case the ASCI&apos;s proceedings were expressly<lb/> mentioned in the plaint. The said Judgment does not in any manner alter the<lb/> well settled legal position. In fact the Judgments relied upon by the Plaintiff<lb/> have been followed. Whether there is in fact disparagement or not in a given fact<lb/> situation is a matter depending on the facts of each case.<lb/></p>

			<p>( ii) Godrej Sara Lee Ltd vs Reckitt Benkiser (I) Ltd 29<lb/> This Judgment, in fact, supports the case of the Plaintiff. Para 5(c) shows<lb/> that the advertisement in question only projected that the product of the<lb/> defendant had both the qualities in one product. Paragraph 13 clearly provides:<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;he can declare that his goods are better than that of his competitor. However,<lb/> while doing so, he cannot disparage the goods of a competitor. … But while<lb/> doing so, he is not permitted to project that his competitors goods are bad.&quot; So<lb/> also, paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 also contain observations which affirm the<lb/> general principles in favour of the Plaintiff and set out the principal that intent,<lb/> manner and storyline of an advertisement have to be borne in mind; the fact<lb/> that in the electronic media the disparaging message is conveyed to the viewer<lb/> by repeatedly showing the commercial everyday thereby leaving an indelible<lb/> impression in their mind etc. is also to be kept in mind by the court. The only<lb/> reason an injunction was not granted in the said case was that there was in fact<lb/> no denigration in the facts of that case. This is dependent on the facts of each<lb/> case.<lb/> 29<lb/> 2006 (32) PTC 307 (Del)<lb/> (iii) Marico Limited vs Adani Wilmar Ltd. 30<lb/> The Judgment is of no assistance to the Defendant No. 1 since the<lb/> message conveyed by the Impugned TVCs in the present Suit is not the truth.<lb/> In fact, the entire message conveyed by the Impugned TVCs in the present case<lb/> is false, as demonstrated hereinabove. The emphasis on the portion in<lb/> paragraph 15 to say that the public expects a certain amount of hyperbole in<lb/> advertisement and that the tests to be applied is whether a reasonable man<lb/> would take the claim being made as one made seriously or will have to take it<lb/> with a pinch of salt, is not at all applicable to the present case. The present case<lb/> is not one of mere hyperbole but placing incorrect facts before the public. In any<lb/> case, the hyper bole may be to puff up one&apos;s product but in so doing cannot<lb/> disparage somebody else&apos;s product. The hyperbole cannot be used in a negative<lb/> connotation for the product of the rival. An example was placed during<lb/> arguments on behalf of the Plaintiff that if a sugar free product were to be<lb/> compared with one containing very little sugar, the sugar free manufacturer<lb/> cannot show a whole sack full of sugar as an ingredient of the rival product.<lb/> Such a hyper bole in the negative sense is nothing but disparagement and<lb/> malicious falsehood.<lb/></p>

			<p>( iv) Phillips India Pvt. Ltd. vs Shree Sant Kripa Appliances Pvt.<lb/> Ltd. 31<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> The case was about the fact that LED bulbs are better than CFL bulbs,<lb/> which was an admitted fact and hence there was no finding of disparagement on<lb/> facts. (para 3.3 and para 4 of the Judgment). The facts of the case were entirely<lb/> different from the facts of the present case.<lb/> There is otherwise no change in the principle enunciated on the law of<lb/> disparagement. This Judgment is of no assistance to the Defendant No. 1. The<lb/> observations in paragraph 7.4 of the Judgment that disparagement is difficult to<lb/> establish at an interlocutory stage unless an entity against whom disparagement<lb/> is directed is the only rival in the trade is contrary to the findings in all other<lb/> Judgments relating to generic disparagement and the settled law and is<lb/> therefore per incuriam and not binding. This finding is also contrary to the<lb/> findings of the Bombay High Court in the case of Godrej vs Jyothi Laboratories<lb/> (supra) and is therefore not binding on this Court. This Judgement is of no<lb/> assistance to Defendant No. 1. In the present case, disparagement of a class is<lb/> established beyond doubt and there is no &quot;difficulty&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<p>(v) Havells India Limited &amp; Anr. vs Amritanshu Khaitan &amp; Ors 32<lb/> This Judgment was cited for the proposition that the defendant was<lb/> entitled to pick and choose the feature that it wished to compare and it was not<lb/> necessary to compare all product features of competing products. In the case in<lb/> question the same feature in the competing products was compared. This is not<lb/> so in in the present case. In the present case, the milk content of AMUL is<lb/> compared with the FAT content of Frozen Dessert which is obviously not the<lb/> same feature in both the products i.e. it is not fat vs fat comparison -but a<lb/> comparison made on distinct and unfair parameters (paragraph 24 page 19 of<lb/> the plaint). Further, in this case it was not the case of the Plaintiff that the chart<lb/> put up is false. Secondly, the Judgement in para 38 to 42 assist the Plaintiff. The<lb/> 32<lb/> . 2015 (62) PTC 64 (Del)<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> advertisement must not be misleading -in the present case they are misleading.<lb/> The features compared must not be misleading -in the present case they are<lb/> misleading. Accordingly, the question of the Plaintiff being &apos;hypersensitive&apos;<lb/> cannot and does not arise in the present case.<lb/></p>

			<p>(vi) Procter &amp; Gamble vs Hindustan Unilever Limited 33<lb/> This Judgment proceeds on a wrong footing and equates an action for<lb/> malicious prosecution / slander of goods with an action for defamation. This is<lb/> contrary to established principles of law, set out above. This Judgment however,<lb/> also recognises, that comparative advertising is permissible so long as the rival&apos;s<lb/> product is not derogated, discredited, disgraced. The fact that the intent,<lb/> manner and storyline of the advertisement are relevant has also been accepted.<lb/> The &quot;hyperbole&quot; referred to in the Judgment is only in the context of puffing<lb/> up one&apos;s own product but cannot be applied to the showing down of another&apos;s<lb/> product. In the present case, there is no element of permissible puffing up of<lb/> the AMUL product. The Defendant No. 1 is seeking to gain an unfair advantage<lb/> by showing an unfair comparison of the products by depicting incorrect<lb/> statements in respect of Frozen Dessert products. In the present case, showing<lb/> a cup full of &quot;Vanaspati&quot; or &quot;Vanaspati TEL&quot; is not permissible especially<lb/> having regard to the negative connotation that the term Vanaspati has, coupled<lb/> with the negative message not to purchase, by saying, &quot;Vanaspati wala nahi<lb/> unhe frozen dessert kehtey hain&quot; along with the visual. The &apos;search attributes&apos;<lb/> and &apos;experience qualities&apos; tests can have no application to the present case since<lb/> shampoos are utility products, whereas ice-creams / Frozen Desserts are not.<lb/></p>

			<p>(vii) Dabur India Ltd. vs. Colortek Meghalaya Pvt. Ltd.(supra)<lb/> This judgment also lends no assistance to the Defendant No. 1. In the<lb/> said Judgment, the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court has reiterated the<lb/> 33<lb/> 2017(69) PTC 528 (Del)<lb/> NMSL-690/2017<lb/> guiding principles set out by the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in its decision in<lb/> Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd. vs. Hindustan Lever Ltd. 34 including the<lb/> principle that an advertisement must not be false, misleading, unfair or<lb/> deceptive and has further clarified that though an advertisement is commercial<lb/> speech and is protected by Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution; if an<lb/> advertisement extends beyond the grey areas and becomes a false, misleading,<lb/> unfair or deceptive advertisement, it would certainly not have the benefit of any<lb/> protection. Again, in the said judgment the Division Bench of the Delhi High<lb/> Court has also followed its decision in Pepsi Co. Inc. and others vs. Hindustan<lb/> Coca Cola Ltd. and another 35 wherein it was held that though boasting about<lb/> one&apos;s product is permissible, disparaging a rival product is not, whilst glorifying<lb/> its product, an advertiser may not denigrate or disparage a rival product.<lb/> Paragraph 278 of the Halsbury&apos;s Laws of England (Fourth Edition Reissue<lb/> Volume 28) is also referred to which provides that &quot;[It] is actionable when the<lb/> words go beyond a mere puff and constitute untrue statements of fact about a<lb/> rival&apos;s product&quot;. The finding in the decision of the Delhi High Court in Dabur<lb/> India Ltd. vs. Wipro Limited, Bangalore 36 is also referred to namely that &quot;[It] is<lb/> one thing to say that the defendant&apos;s product is better than that of the Plaintiff<lb/> and it is another thing to say that the Plaintiff&apos;s product is inferior to that of the<lb/> defendant&quot;. In the instant case, as pointed out hereinabove, the Defendant No.<lb/> 1 is clearly guilty of disparaging the rival product i.e. frozen desserts by making<lb/> untrue statements of fact with regard to the same and also asking the<lb/> consumers not to have frozen desserts but instead have the product of<lb/> Defendant No.1 i.e. Amul ice cream.<lb/></p>

			<p>54. I have therefore considered the content, intent of commercial, the<lb/> manner of the commercial, the storyline of the commercial; and the message<lb/> sought to be conveyed by the Impugned TVCs in totality and it has become<lb/> crystal clear that the same are shown with the sole intention of disparaging the<lb/> entire category of Frozen Desserts. From the storyline and the manner of the<lb/> impugned advertisements, it can clearly be seen that the message that is sought<lb/> to be given in the impugned advertisements, is that all Frozen Desserts contain<lb/> Vanaspati/ hydrogenated vegetable oil and that all Frozen Desserts are<lb/> necessarily unhealthy / harmful and should not be purchased / consumed. The<lb/> fact that the advertisement campaign or visual media has an immediate impact<lb/> on the viewers and purchaser&apos;s mind, I see substance in the submission of the<lb/> Plaintiff that irreversible damage is caused to the Plaintiff. The impugned<lb/> advertisements are being telecast repeatedly, thus confusing the consumers and<lb/> disseminating incorrect information. The Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to<lb/> interim relief against the Defendant No.1.<lb/></p>

			<p>55. The learned Senior Advocate appearing for the Plaintiff has rightly also<lb/> drawn my attention to the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in R.R.<lb/> Oomerbhoy Pvt. Ltd. vs Court Receiver, High Court &amp;Ors 37 , the<lb/> relevant portions of which are reproduced hereunder:<lb/> &quot;In a matter such as the present, therefore, it<lb/> would be most inappropriate for this Court to<lb/> permit the Appellant to use the mark POSTIANO<lb/> with a modification of the colour scheme, get-up<lb/> or trade dress. Equally, it would be inappropriate<lb/> for this Court to suggest such modifications. That<lb/> the use of the mark by the Appellant was not<lb/> honest or bona fide is also clear, as noted earlier<lb/> 37<lb/> . 2003 (27) PTC 580 Bom<lb/> from the advertisement of the Appellant containing<lb/> a postcard with a postal stamp and a postman in<lb/> the background. An assumption of good faith<lb/> which underlies the request for a modification<lb/> cannot be made in this case, in view of the conduct<lb/> of the appellant. A similar situation arose before<lb/> the Court of Appeal in England in Wright, Layman<lb/> &amp; Umney Ltd. v. Wright, 1949 (46) RPC 149. The<lb/> Master of the Rolls, Lord Greene speaking for the<lb/> Court of Appeal, put it succinctly thus :<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;It has been said many times that it is no part of<lb/> the function of this Court to examine imaginar y<lb/> cases of what the defendant could or could not do<lb/> under this form of injunction. The best guide, if he<lb/> is an honest man, is his own conscience; and it is<lb/> certainly not the business of this Court to give him<lb/> instructions or hints as to how near the wind he<lb/> can sail. Honest men do not attempt to sail near<lb/> the wind.&quot;<lb/> We, therefore, reject this submission.&quot; (emphasis supplied).<lb/></item>

			<item>However the disparaging manner in which the impugned TVC&apos;s are<lb/> made/prepared it is in any event not possible to direct/order/suggest any<lb/> modification/s to the same.<lb/></item>

			<p>56. In the circumstances, I proceed to pass the following Order:<lb/> The Notice of Motion is allowed and the Defendant Nos.1 and 2 are<lb/> restrained from inter alia (i) telecasting or broadcasting or otherwise howsoever<lb/> communicating to the public or publishing two Television Commercials<lb/> (hereinafter, the Impugned TVCs) or any part thereof or any other<lb/> advertisement of a similar nature in any language or in any manner causing the<lb/> Impugned TVCs or any part thereof or any other advertisement of a similar<lb/> nature to be telecast or broadcast or communicated to the public or published in<lb/> any manner and (ii) disparaging or denigrating the Plaintiff&apos;s KWALITY<lb/> WALL&apos;S products (including Frozen Desserts manufactured and/ or sold under<lb/> the said brand and sub-brands thereof ) or the Plaintiff&apos;s business in any manner<lb/> whatsoever.<lb/> Accordingly the Notice of Motion is disposed of with costs.<lb/></p>

			<p>(S. J. K ATHAWALLA, J.)<lb/> After the above Judgment is pronounced the Learned Advocate<lb/> appearing for the Defendant No.1 has requested that the order passed against<lb/> Defendant No.1 be stayed. This court having come to the conclusion that<lb/> Defendant No.1 is guilty of disparaging the rival product i.e. Frozen desserts by<lb/> making false statements of facts with regard to the same and also indulging in a<lb/> negative campaign and also asking the consumers not to have frozen desserts<lb/> but instead have the product of Defendant No.1 i.e. Amul ice-cream, which is<lb/> not permissible in law, the question of granting any stay on the order does not<lb/> arise. The application for stay is therefore rejected.<lb/></p>
