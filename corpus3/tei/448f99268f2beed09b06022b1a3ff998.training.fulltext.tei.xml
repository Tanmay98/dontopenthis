			3.1.
			<lb />
			The Advocate for the Petitioner vrst moved this Court at around 11.30
			<lb />
			a.m. on 9 th ieptember, 2020, and sought circulation of the Writ Petition at the earliest.
			<lb />
			iince the MCGM had vled a Caveat, he was asked to give notice to the MCGM and
			<lb />
			the hearing was vxed within an hour i.e. at 12.30 p.m. The unafrmed Petition, being
			<lb />
			vled in extreme urgency and when the Petitioner was not available in Mumbai, lacked
			<lb />
			material particulars/averments and was incomplete. The Petitioner was, therefore,
			<lb />
			granted liberty to amend the Writ Petition at the time of granting ad-interim reliefs on
			<lb />
			9 th ieptember, 2020 and also on 10 th ieptember, 2020. Pursuant thereto, the Petition
			<lb />
			was amended. In the amended Writ Petition, the Petitioner reiterated her allegation
			<lb />
			that the demolition carried out by MCGM was malavde/malicious, with ulterior
			<lb />
			motives. In support thereof she interalia relied on a video clip recording the interview
			<lb />
			of ihri ianjay Raut, wherein he had allegedly abused the Petitioner. ihe also relied on
			<lb />
			the news report pertaining to the demolition of her bungalow, captioned &apos;m[kkM+ fn;k&apos; ,
			<lb />
			meaning -&apos;uprooted&apos; published in the Marathi daily newspaper &apos;iaamna&apos; of 10 th
			<lb />
			ieptember, 2020 (i.e. the day after the demolition), of which newspaper ihri Raut is
			<lb />
			the Executive Editor. Therefore, by our Order dated 22 nd ieptember, 2020, the
			<lb />
			Petitioner was allowed to join ihri Raut as party Respondent to the above Writ
			<lb />
			Petition. It was also alleged by the Petitioner in the above Writ Petition, that ihri
			<lb />
			Bhagyavant Late, Designated Ofcer of MCGM, had with malavde and malicious
			<lb />
			intent, issued the impugned Notice dated 7 th ieptember, 2020, followed by an Order
			<lb />
			of Demolition dated 9 th ieptember, 2020, and proceeded to demolish the bungalow of
			<lb />
			the Petitioner. Therefore, by our said Order dated 22 nd ieptember, 2020, ihri Late
			<lb />
			was also allowed to be joined in his personal capacity, as party Respondent to the
			<lb />
			above Writ Petition. Consequently, ihri Bhagyawant Late and ihri ianjay Raut are
			<lb />
			joined as Respondent Nos. 4 and 5, respectively, to the above Writ Petition.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3.2.
			<lb />
			On 28 th ieptember, 2020, the learned ienior Advocate appearing for
			<lb />
			MCGM, whilst dealing with the Petitioner&apos;s allegation that the impugned action of
			<lb />
			demolition was with malavde / malicious intent, denied and disputed the said
			<lb />
			allegation by submitting that a Mukadam of the MCGM had visited the bungalow of
			<lb />
			the Petitioner on that day at around 1.00 p.m., whereas the Petitioner&apos;s tweet pointing
			<lb />
			out ihri Raut&apos;s statements against the Petitioner, was at 5.12 p.m. The Advocate for
			<lb />
			the MCGM, whilst making the above submission, did not provide the time at which
			<lb />
			ihri Raut made the ofending statements against the Petitioner. In fact, ihri Raut
			<lb />
			himself has not made any such submission. However, since the learned ienior
			<lb />
			Advocate for the Petitioner, in response, submitted that there was additional material
			<lb />
			in the form of tweets etc., which convrms the Petitioner&apos;s submissions qua the
			<lb />
			malavde/malicious intent of the Respondents in proceeding with the demolition of the
			<lb />
			Petitioner&apos;s bungalow, the Court directed the Advocate for the Petitioner to produce
			<lb />
			in Court, copies of such additional material and also forward the same to the
			<lb />
			Advocates for the Respondents. The learned ienior Advocate for the Petitioner
			<lb />
			thereafter tendered a compilation of tweets from 30 th August, 2020 onwards and also
			<lb />
			tendered a copy of one more news report published on the vrst page of the Marathi
			<lb />
			Daily &apos;iaamna&apos; dated 5 th ieptember, 2020, captioned &quot;ea q cbZ &apos;kh ia xk] iMs y ega xk !&quot;
			<lb />
			meaning : &quot;Joining issues with Mumbai will prove costly&quot;, alongwith a quote (in
			<lb />
			Marathi) of ihri Raut wherein he states that, &quot;it is a promise that Shiv Sena will
			<lb />
			perform Shraddha (i.e. obsequies) of such enemies of Maharashtra&quot;. A copy of
			<lb />
			the said compilation was also forwarded to the Advocates for the Respondents.
			<lb />
			Relying on the said compilation, the Advocate for the Petitioner submitted that the
			<lb />
			contents of the compilation (copies of tweets and news report dated 5 th ieptember,
			<lb />
			2020) alongwith the video clip and the news report in the Marathi Daily &apos;iaamna&apos;
			<lb />
			dated 10 th ieptember, 2020, exposed the malavde / malicious intent of ihri Raut to
			<lb />
			cause injury to the Petitioner through the ofcers of the MCGM. There was no
			<lb />
			objection raised by the Advocates for the Respondents at the time when the Court
			<lb />
			called upon the Advocate to submit copies of the tweets and the news report dated 10 th
			<lb />
			ieptember, 2020 nor at the time when the Petitioner actually tendered and relied
			<lb />
			upon the same in Court.

		<p>

			<lb />

			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4.16.
			<lb />
			The photographs of the frontal / outer facade of the said Bungalow
			<lb />
			which appeared on the website of Quint Entertainment on 15 th January, 2020, show

			According to the Petitioner, she, being a public-spirited person,
			<lb />
			consistently airs her views regarding issues of public importance on social media
			<lb />
			platforms, some of which at times are critical of the afairs and conduct of the

			administration and the Government of the day. In recent times, the Petitioner has
			<lb />
			been at loggerheads with the Government of Maharashtra regarding her views over the
			<lb />
			handling of certain issues which impact the public in general. The expression used by
			<lb />
			her has displeased and caused anger in certain quarters, particularly a political party
			<lb />
			(ihiv iena) which is a part of the Government in Maharashtra, and is also the ruling
			<lb />
			party in the MCGM. By the end of August, 2020, the Petitioner, in her several tweets,
			<lb />
			has severely criticized the Mumbai Police. The particulars of her tweets are as under :
			<lb />
			30 th August, 2020 at 2.01 p.m. : &quot;I am more sfared of Mumbai polife now than the movie

			<lb />
			low…SHAME !! .&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			1 st September, 2020 at 10.54 p.m. : &quot;When @CPMumbaiPolife is openly intimidating
			<lb />
			me like this啾 enfouraging bullying and frime against me啾 will I be safe in Mumbai ? Who is
			<lb />
			responsible for my safety ? @ PMOIndia.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>

			<lb />
			don&apos;t you forget not just me all the people taged got notififations of @CPMumbaiPolife
			<lb />

			<lb />
			you dare to lie @MumbaiPolife啾 don&apos;t you dare…&quot;.
			<lb />
			In response, the Mumbai Police tweeted on the same day that &quot;This tweet has never
			<lb />
			been liked by @CPMumbaiPolife-the fyber polife station has been asked to examine the
			<lb />
			sfreenshot.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			3 rd September, 2020, at 12.27 p.m. : &quot;Sanjay Raut Shiv Sena leader has given me an
			<lb />
			open threat and asked me not to fome bafk to Mumbai啾 after Aazadi graftis in Mumbai
			<lb />
			streets and now open threats啾 why Mumbai is feeling like Pakistan offupied Kashmir ?.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4 th September, 2020, at about 12.53 p.m. : &quot;I see many people are threatening me to not
			<lb />
			fome bafk to Mumbai so I have now defided to travel to Mumbai this foming week on 9 th
			<lb />
			September啾 I will post the time when I land at the Mumbai airport啾 kisi ke baap main
			<lb />
			himmat hai toh rok le&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4.18.
			<lb />
			In view of various threats being given to the Petitioner, including threats
			<lb />
			of harm if she entered Mumbai, the Petitioner was compelled to seek
			<lb />
			assistance/security and was given protection under Y-plus category by the Central
			<lb />
			Government. The Petitioner could come to Mumbai only under such protection.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4.19.
			<lb />
			On the vrst page of the Marathi daily newspaper &apos;iaamna&apos; dated 5 th
			<lb />
			ieptember, 2020, of which ihri ianjay Raut is an Executive Editor, a news report
			<lb />
			under the following caption appeared :
			<lb />
			Meaning : Joining issues with Mumbai, will prove costly.
			<lb />
			In the said article / news report, it is stated that Kangana Ranaut&apos;s (Petitioner&apos;s)
			<lb />
			reference to Mumbai as Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, thereby joining issues with
			<lb />
			Mumbai and Mumbaikars, is going to prove costly. It is further stated that the Home
			<lb />
			Minister has stated that Kangana has no right to stay in Mumbai and Maharashtra. It
			<lb />
			is further stated that ihiv iainiks have given a stern warning to Kangana to the efect
			<lb />
			that if she steps into Mumbai, their ladies will beat her with chappals / shoes.
			<lb />
			On the same page, the quote of ihri ianjay Raut appeared as under :
			<lb />
			Meaning : Mumbai belongs only to forefathers of Marathi people. Those
			<lb />
			who do not agree with this, they should show who are their fathers. It is a
			<lb />
			promise that Shiv Sena will perform Shraddha (i.e. obsequies) of such
			<lb />
			enemies of Maharashtra. The Health Department should handle mental
			<lb />
			cases of such persons also who talk any nonsense about Mumbai.
			<lb />
			ianjay Raut, ihiv iena Leader, Member of Parliament.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4.20.
			<lb />
			On the same day, i.e. on 5 th ieptember, 2020, ihri Raut has answered in
			<lb />
			Hindi, certain questions put to him by a reporter of News Nation Channel in Hindi.
			<lb />
			The DVD containing the video clip of the said interview in Hindi is tendered in Court
			<lb />
			by the Petitioner, the English version of which is as under :
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Sanjay Raut : I am of the view that such person will have to bring her father here, and
			<lb />
			show us the father if there is one.
			<lb />
			News Nation : Will ihiv iena stop her. iome leaders have stated that they will stop
			<lb />
			her and beat her.
			<lb />
			Sanjay Raut : ihiv iena is not just the Jaagir of Maharashtra, all parties are there in it,
			<lb />
			all persons are in it, all of us will meet and decide.
			<lb />
			News Nation : It is your Government, will you take any action against the law ?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Sanjay Raut : Kya Hota Hai Kanoon ? Has the girl respected the law in what she has
			<lb />
			spoken ? Why are you advocating for that Haramkhor girl, who has insulted ihivaji
			<lb />
			Mahajraj and has insulted Maharashtra ? Are you on her side ? Is your Channel
			<lb />
			supporting her ?
			<lb />
			(ianjay Raut walks away in anger)
			<lb />
			News Nation : Thanks for talking to News Nation.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4.21.
			<lb />
			Again, on the same day, i.e. iaturday, 5 th ieptember, 2020 at about 1.00
			<lb />
			p.m. according to the MCGM, the Mukadam of the MCGM visited the Petitioner&apos;s
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</p>

			cisusing your docinant position.&quot; The Advocate for the Petitioner also recorded in
			<lb />
			the said reply letter dated 8 th ieptember, 2020 that, &quot;all allegations made by your
			<lb />
			department by resorting to falsehood shall be legally dealt with by my flient under the

			client with any hidden agenda coupled with ulterior motive.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4.25.
			<lb />
			On 8 th ieptember, 2020, the MCGM vled a Caveat under iection 148A

			<lb />
			seeking a maximum of 07 days&apos; time to respond to the impugned Notice received by
			<lb />
			her on 8 th ieptember, 2020 was rejected. ihri Late passed an Order on 9 th ieptember,
			<lb />
			2020, stating therein &quot;it has been notifed that after refeipt of the notife you have not
			<lb />
			stopped farrying the work and fontinued the work. Under these firfumstanfes your request

			<lb />
			<lb />
			failed to produce the permission/ approval/ sanction granted to carry out the changes
			<lb />
			in the approved B.C.C. plan dated 7 th March, 1979. Therefore, the work carried out by

			the Petitioner as mentioned in the Notice ichedule was declared as unauthorized. It
			<lb />
			was also stated that he was satisved that the Petitioner had not stopped the work and
			<lb />
			therefore, the notice structure as mentioned in the ichedule of the Notice was liable
			<lb />
			to be forthwith demolished.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4.28.
			<lb />
			The said Order dated 9 th ieptember, 2020, was pasted on the same day
			<lb />
			i.e. on 9 th ieptember, 2020, at 10.35 a.m., when the MCGM&apos;s ofcers were already
			<lb />
			present outside the Petitioner&apos;s said Bungalow alongwith a JCB and other equipments,
			<lb />
			ready to demolish the said Bungalow, even prior to the pasting of the said Order. This
			<lb />
			is established from the Petitioner&apos;s tweet dated 9 th ieptember, 2020 at 10.19 a.m.
			<lb />
			wherein she has stated that. &quot;the Maharashtra Government and their goons&quot; are at
			<lb />
			her property all set to illegally break it down.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4.29.
			<lb />
			On 9 th ieptember, 2020, at around 11.30 a.m. the present Writ Petition
			<lb />
			was moved in extreme urgency and the Petitioner&apos;s Advocate himself went to the said
			<lb />
			Bungalow to serve a copy of the Writ Petition on the ofcers of MCGM and also to
			<lb />
			inform them that the matter was sub-judice and kept for hearing at 12.30 p.m. The
			<lb />
			ofcers of MCGM did not pay any attention to what the Advocate for the Petitioner
			<lb />
			had to say; instead they locked the said Bungalow of the Petitioner from inside and
			<lb />
			with malavde intent demolished 40% of the said Bungalow and damaged the following

				<lb />
				On 9 th ieptember, 2020, this Court passed an ad-interim Order
				<lb />
				restraining the MCGM from carrying out any further demolition and also recorded
				<lb />
				the manner in which the MCGM conducted itself despite having vled a Caveat
				<lb />
				expecting a Court hearing, i.e. the Advocate for the MCGM did not have a copy of the
				<lb />
				Petition which was duly served on MCGM and neither did the Advocate have a copy
				<lb />
				of its own impugned Notice dated 7 th ieptember, 2020 issued under iection 354A of
				<lb />
				the Act to the Petitioner and no ofcer of the MCGM was available to instruct the
				<lb />
				Advocate, when the Advocate vrst appeared before the Court.
				<lb />
				4.31.
				<lb />
				This Court, by its Order dated 9 th ieptember, 2020, rendered its prima
				<lb />
				facie vnding that the MCGM&apos;s conduct smacked of malavdes. However, in none of
				<lb />
				the Afdavits vled by MCGM any justivcation or explanation is ofered in regard to
				<lb />
				such conduct.
			</p>
			<p>
				4.32.
				<lb />
				The day after the demolition i.e. 10 th ieptember, 2020, the Newspaper
				<lb />
				&apos;iaamna&apos; of which ihri Raut is the Executive Editor, reported the demolition on its
				<lb />
				vrst page in a manner of rejoicing, i.e. with the headline &quot;m[kkM+ fn;k&quot; meaning :
				<lb />
				&apos;uprooted&apos;. In the said newspaper report, it is interalia stated that the Petitioner who
				<lb />
				was unnecessarily spoiling the name of the Mumbai Police by comparing Mumbai with
				<lb />
				Pakistan Occupied Kashmir has received a good blow from MCGM.

				<lb />
				When the Court was going through the Afdavits and the written

				<lb />
				5 th ieptember, 2020 submitted by the Petitioner on 28 th ieptember, 2020, in the
				<lb />

				<lb />
				SUBMISSIONS MADE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN
				<lb />
				ADDITION TO WHAT IS STATED ABOVE:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				7.1.
				<lb />
				Relying on iections 44, 45 (1), 52, 53 and 54 of the Maharashtra
				<lb />
				Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 (the &apos;MRTP Act&apos;) ; iections 342, 351 and
				<lb />
				354A of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888 ; Circular dated 15 th March,
				<lb />
				2012 of MCGM ; the decisions of the iupreme Court in the case of Muni Suvrat
				<lb />
				Swaci Jain v/s. Arun Gaikwad 1 ; MCGM v/s. Sunbeac High Tefh Developers 2 and
				<lb />
				the decisions of this Court in the case of Abdul Razzaq Sunesra v/s. MCGM 3 ;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				MCGM v/s. Jagdishfhandra Mehra 4 ; Sopan Maruti Thopte v/s. Pune Munifipal
				<lb />
				Corporation 5 , the Petitioner has submitted that invocation of iection 354A of the Act
				<lb />
				is illegal and an abuse of the powers and authority vested under the said itatute.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				7.2.
				<lb />
				In the present case, the provisions of iection 354A of the Act have been
				<lb />
				invoked under the false pretext that there was ongoing work of construction at the
				<lb />
				Petitioner&apos;s Bungalow. The documents and material on record, which includes the
				<lb />
				photographs relied upon by the Petitioner as well as the MCGM, establish beyond an
				<lb />
				iota of doubt that the alleged unauthorized works were already in existence and there
				<lb />
				was no ongoing work of construction as alleged by MCGM. iection 354A was invoked
				<lb />
				only to deprive a fair opportunity to the Petitioner to take steps in accordance with law
				<lb />
				to seek redress and if required, to seek regularization. The fact that there was no
				<lb />
				ongoing work of construction is evident from the detailed reasons set out in paragraph
				<lb />
				45 of the written submissions vled on behalf of the Petitioner.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				7.3.
				<lb />
				It is settled law that malavdes cannot be established by direct evidence
				<lb />
				but may be discernible from circumstances.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				7.4.
				<lb />
				The impugned Notice, order of demolition and its execution are vitiated
				<lb />
				by malice in fact, for the reasons set out in paragraph 73 of the written submissions and
				<lb />
				<lb />
				irrespective of malice in fact, the actions are vitiated by malice in law as explained in
				<lb />
				paragraph 76 of the written submissions of the Petitioner.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				7.5.
				<lb />
				In order to prove that the impugned Notice, Order of demolition and
				<lb />
				action are vitiated by malice in fact and, in any case, by malice in law, the Petitioner
				<lb />
				has relied on the decisions of the iupreme Court in Rajneesh Khajuria v/s.
				<lb />
				Wofkhardt Ltd. 6 ; State of Andhra Pradesh v/s. Govardhanlal Pitti 7 , State of Punjab
				<lb />
				v/s. Gurdial Singh 8 , Kalabharti Advertising v/s. Hecant Narifhania 9 , Sct. S.R.
				<lb />
				Venkatracan v/s. Union of India 10 , the decision of the Calcutta High Court in
				<lb />
				Birendra Kucar Singh v/s. Union of India 11 and the decision of this Court in Reserve
				<lb />
				Bank Ecployees&apos; v/s. State of Maharashtra 12 .
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				7.6
				<lb />
				In the present case, the exercise of power by Respondent Nos.1 to 4 is
				<lb />
				colourable and a fraud on the itatute, i.e. the Act. Every power vested in a public
				<lb />
				body or authority has to be used honestly, bonavde and reasonably. In support of this
				<lb />
				submission, the Petitioner has relied upon the decisions of the iupreme Court in
				<lb />
				Shrisht v/s. Shaw Bros 13 , State of Bihar v/s. P.P. Sharca 14 and S. Pratap Singh v/s.
				<lb />
				State of Punjab 15 .
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				7.7.
				<lb />
				There are several lacunas in the Inspection Report at Exhibit-B / Page
				<lb />
				No. 32 of the MCGM&apos;s Afdavit dated 10 th ieptember, 2020, which are listed in Part-
				<lb />
				C of the written submissions vled on behalf of the Petitioner.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				7.8.
				<lb />
				The MCGM claims that the Detection Report was prepared on 5 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020 at 1.00 p.m. However, the same was not produced before the Court.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				7.9.
				<lb />
				The Petitioner, through her Afdavit in Rejoinder, has produced a
				<lb />
				Detection Report Register, which was available online and which shows that the
				<lb />
				detection took place on 7 th ieptember, 2020 and not on 5 th ieptember, 2020.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				7.10.
				<lb />
				The MCGM has vled its Afdavit in Reply dated 10 th ieptember, 2020,
				<lb />
				Additional Afdavit in Reply dated 17 th ieptember, 2020, and Afdavit in iur
				<lb />
				Rejoinder dated 24 th ieptember, 2020. In each of these Afdavits, MCGM has taken
				<lb />
				inconsistent pleas and has tried to improve its case. The stand taken in the Afdavits
				<lb />
				are also contrary to the various documents produced by MCGM. iome of the
				<lb />
				inconsistent pleas of MCGM have been set out / listed in paragraph 20 of the written
				<lb />
				submissions vled on behalf of the Petitioner.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				7.11.
				<lb />
				No attempt has been made by MCGM to explain the discrepancies in the
				<lb />
				documents and the contentions raised as listed / set out in paragraph 23 of the written
				<lb />
				submissions.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				7.12.
				<lb />
				The Petitioner has since inception pleaded that had the Petitioner been
				<lb />
				given a fair opportunity prior to demolition, the Petitioner could have consulted an
				<lb />
				expert and taken remedial steps as required, including giving a proper response
				<lb />
				contesting the allegations, and if required, apply for regularization under iection 53(3)
				<lb />
				of the MRTP Act.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				7.13.
				<lb />
				The undue haste with which the said Bungalow was demolished has
				<lb />
				deprived the Petitioner of a fair opportunity to apply for regularization, if so required.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				7.14.
				<lb />
				The Circular dated 28 th February, 2020, issued by MCGM, also clearly
				<lb />
				contemplates regularization of internal work on payment of penalty.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				7.15.
				<lb />
				As held by the Delhi High Court in the case of Sayeed Ali v/s.
				<lb />
				Munifipal Corporation of Delhi 16 and by this Court in the case of G.J.Kanga v/s.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				S.S.Basha 17 , a case of unauthorized construction does not always warrant a
				<lb />
				demolition.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				7.16.
				<lb />
				The act of demolition is in breach of the Orders passed by this Court
				<lb />
				restraining demolition in view of the current pandemic.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				7.17.
				<lb />
				At a belated stage, in a iur Rejoinder, MCGM has raised a contention
				<lb />
				that the Writ Petition ought not to be entertained and the Petitioner should be
				<lb />
				relegated to the remedy of a Civil iuit.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				7.18.
				<lb />
				There are no disputed questions of facts as alleged by the MCGM.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				7.19.
				<lb />
				In arguments, MCGM contended that a Civil iuit is the norm and
				<lb />
				entertaining of a Writ Petition can only be in exceptional circumstances, which
				<lb />
				according to MCGM, the Petitioner has not made out. Reliance placed by MCGM in
				<lb />
				support of this contention to the Judgment of this Court in the case of Abdul Karic
				<lb />
				Ahced Mansoori v/s. Munifipal Corporation of Greater Mucbai 18 is misconceived.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				7.20.
				<lb />
				iection 515A of the Act incorporates a bar of jurisdiction and provides
				<lb />
				that any notice issued, Order passed, or direction issued by the Designated Ofcer,
				<lb />
				under iection 351 or 354A of the Act shall not be questioned in any iuit or legal
				<lb />
				proceedings. The constitutional validity of this provision was challenged before this
				<lb />
				Court in the case of Abdul Razzaq Sunesra v/s. MCGM 19 . A Division Bench of this
				<lb />
				Court (Coram: Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud J as he then was and i. C. Gupte J) after
				<lb />
				analyzing the icheme of the Act upheld the validity of the provision and held that a
				<lb />
				remedy of a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is available to the
				<lb />
				Petitioner.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				7.21.
				<lb />
				The iupreme Court has held that the High Court is justived in
				<lb />
				exercising its powers to the exclusion of all other remedies when it vnds that the action
				<lb />
				of the itate, or its instrumentality, is arbitrary and unreasonable and as such violative
				<lb />
				of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				7.22.
				<lb />
				In support of the submission that the Petitioner is justived in vling the
				<lb />
				above Writ Petition for reliefs sought therein, the Petitioner has also relied on the
				<lb />
				decisions of the iupreme Court in ABL International v/s. Export Credit 20 ; Popatrao
				<lb />
				Patil v/s. State of Maharashtra 21 ; Century Spinning and Manufafturing Cocpany
				<lb />
				v/s. Ulhas Nagar Munifipal Counfil 22 and Sayed Maqbool Ali v/s. State of UP 23 .
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				7.23.
				<lb />
				The impugned Notice, Order of demolition and its execution being ex-
				<lb />
				facie illegal, the same ought to be set aside. The Petitioner ought to be permitted to
				<lb />
				take such steps as are required to make the said Bungalow habitable, so that the
				<lb />
				Petitioner can immediately start occupying and using the same. As regards the
				<lb />
				restoration of the demolition work, the Petitioner be allowed to take such steps as this
				<lb />
				Court may deem vt and proper in accordance with law, under the supervision of the
				<lb />
				Court. The Petitioner is also entitled to compensation to make good the loss and
				<lb />
				damage caused to the Petitioner as a result of the illegal and highhanded action of
				<lb />
				MCGM.
				<lb />

			<p>

				<lb />
				SUBMISSIONS MADE ON BEHALF OF MCGM :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.1.
				<lb />
				The learned ienior Advocate appearing for MCGM has made the
				<lb />
				following submissions :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.2.
				<lb />
				In view of the false denials / allegations made in the Writ Petition,
				<lb />
				several disputed questions of fact arise which cannot appropriately be decided in a
				<lb />
				Writ.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.3.
				<lb />
				The Division Bench of this Court in the case of Abdul Karic Ahced
				<lb />
				Mansoori v/s. MCGM (supra), has held that notices under iections 351 and 354A of
				<lb />
				the Act could and should be challenged only by vling a Civil iuit.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.4.
				<lb />
				The Petitioner in the Writ Petition has not made any averments or
				<lb />
				submissions regarding any special facts or circumstances for challenging the notice
				<lb />
				and Order of demolition under iection 354A (1) of the Act under Article 226 of the
				<lb />
				Constitution of India, instead of following the norm of challenging the same in a Civil
				<lb />
				iuit.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.5.
				<lb />
				The record establishes that the Petitioner has unlawfully carried out
				<lb />
				substantial alteration and additions to the property, has made false statements /
				<lb />
				denials and has also withheld material facts.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.6.
				<lb />
				The record establishes that the Petitioner brazenly and unlawfully
				<lb />
				carried out extensive alternations and additions contrary to the approved building plan
				<lb />
				to the bungalow and has sought to make evasive and later demonstrably false denials
				<lb />
				regarding carrying out such unlawful work, as set out in Part III of the written
				<lb />
				submissions of the MCGM.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.7.
				<lb />
				The Petitioner has falsely alleged that the work was not ongoing on 5 th /
				<lb />
				7 th ieptember, 2020 and has maintained a studied silence on when according to her
				<lb />
				such unlawful work had been done.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.8.
				<lb />
				The Petitioner has made allegation of malavde and harassment to cover
				<lb />
				up the fact that she has unlawfully carried out substantial alternations and additions in
				<lb />
				the said Bungalow contrary to the building plan and in an attempt to protect such
				<lb />
				unlawful alternations and additions.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.9.
				<lb />
				The impugned Notice issued under iection 354A lists in its ichedule
				<lb />
				(description of work) the ongoing renovation and vnishing work to the unauthorized
				<lb />
				portion of the premises, which is beyond the approved plan dated 7 th March, 1979 and
				<lb />
				thereafter, Items &apos;a&apos; to &apos;n&apos; lists / gives specivc details of the 14 unlawful additions and
				<lb />
				alterations.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.10.
				<lb />
				The impugned Notice not only disclosed the said 14 unlawful additions
				<lb />
				and alterations contrary to the approved plan, but also the presence of vve workmen
				<lb />
				with material (plywood and construction debris) carrying on renovation and vnishing
				<lb />
				work throughout the said Bungalow, including the unauthorized portions.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.11.
				<lb />
				The photographs annexed to the MCGM&apos;s Afdavit in iur Rejoinder at
				<lb />
				Exhibit-B, pages 156-170 (and particularly pages 156, 160, 161 and 163) show workmen
				<lb />
				with materials and sacks containing plywood pieces and construction debris and at
				<lb />
				Exhibit-C at pages 192 to 195 show the presence of vve workmen and the supervisor in
				<lb />
				the property at the time of the inspection on 7 th ieptember, 2020.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.12.
				<lb />
				In the Petitioner&apos;s Advocate&apos;s Reply dated 8 th ieptember, 2020, the
				<lb />
				Petitioner falsely alleged that, &quot;that no work is being farried out by cy flient in her
				<lb />
				precises as &quot;falsely understood by you&quot; and sought seven days time to vle a detailed
				<lb />
				reply.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.13.
				<lb />
				The Petitioner did not dispute / deny that the additions and alterations
				<lb />
				listed in the Notice issued under iection 354A of the Act, have been carried out.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.14.
				<lb />
				That in the amended Writ Petition, the Petitioner again did not dispute
				<lb />
				the alterations and additions carried on and listed in the impugned Notice, as also the
				<lb />
				presence of workmen, material and tools at the property at the time of inspection on
				<lb />
				7 th ieptember, 2020. Instead the Petitioner stated that, &quot;Petitioner was unable to
				<lb />
				focprehend the details given in the Sfhedule of the notife flearly as the sace required
				<lb />
				expert fonsultation&quot;, &quot;are cerely operational use of area of said bungalow and
				<lb />
				fannot be said to be unauthorized or illegal&quot; and &quot;the frst inspeftion report does not
				<lb />
				cention naces of any of the workcen purported to have been farrying on the alleged
				<lb />
				work, nor does it cention the presenfe of any caterial or tools found at the said
				<lb />
				bungalow whifh were used to farry out the alleged work&quot;.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.15.
				<lb />
				That in paragraph 7 C (g) and Ground G (ix), the Petitioner has made
				<lb />
				evasive &quot;denials&quot; regarding the unlawful work, alterations and additions carried on by
				<lb />
				her.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				8.16.
				<lb />
				That in the Afdavit in Rejoinder, the Petitioner for the vrst time made
				<lb />
				averments, including denials that the sanctioned plans establish that illegal work was
				<lb />
				carried out, and that at the time of inspection six workmen alongwith material and
				<lb />
				tools were also found to be present and work of renovation and vnishing was found to
				<lb />
				be going on in the entire property, including the unlawful additions and alterations,
				<lb />
				and that no photographs of those six workmen have been produced.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				8.17.
				<lb />
				That if iection 354A of the Act is to be restricted only to the actual
				<lb />
				erection work ongoing on the date of the inspection and the issuance of the impugned
				<lb />
				Notice, it would result in an absurd situation, wherein with respect to work on the
				<lb />
				property which is ongoing, the portion which has been done yesterday, or a few days
				<lb />
				ago cannot be the subject matter of iection 354A of the Act and only the portion of
				<lb />
				the work which is actually ongoing on the day of inspection can be made the subject
				<lb />
				matter of iection 354A of the Act.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.18.
				<lb />
				The allegations of malavde, bias and conspiracy are both inadequate to
				<lb />
				make a plea of malavde and are also untenable in law.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.19.
				<lb />
				In the case of Rajneesh Khajuria v/s. Wofkhardt licited 24 , the iupreme
				<lb />
				Court has held that such allegations of malavdes &quot;demands of proof of a high order of
				<lb />
				credibility&quot;.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.20.
				<lb />
				The untenability of the case of malavdes pleaded is apparent from the
				<lb />
				fact that the Petitioner&apos;s statement (tweet) referred to in paragraph 4-A of the Writ
				<lb />
				Petition was made at around 05.00 p.m. on the 5 th ieptember, 2020, whereas the vrst
				<lb />
				visit to the Petitioner&apos;s Bungalow by the Mukadam of the MCGM was around 1.00
				<lb />
				p.m. on the same day, i.e. well before the Petitioner&apos;s tweet.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				24 (2020) 3 iCC 86 (paras 16-20)
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.21.
				<lb />
				That it is well settled that even if malice is to be attributed to a
				<lb />
				Government or a itatutory Local Authority, it cannot be a case of malice in fact, i.e.
				<lb />
				personal ill will or spite of the Government / Local Authority. It could only mean
				<lb />
				malice in law, i.e. legal malavdes, or in other words, exercise of statutory power for
				<lb />
				purposes foreign to those for which it is in law intended.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.22.
				<lb />
				Even if this Court comes to the conclusion that iection 354A of the Act
				<lb />
				could not have been invoked, as the erection of the unlawful additions and alterations
				<lb />
				was not ongoing / had allegedly been completed prior to 7 th ieptember, 2020, the
				<lb />
				Petitioner cannot and should not be permitted to reconstruct the unlawful additions
				<lb />
				and alterations which were demolished on 9 th ieptember, 2020. In support of this
				<lb />
				contention, reliance is placed on the decision of the iupreme Court in Munifipal
				<lb />
				Corporation of Greater Mucbai v/s. Sunbeac High Tefh Developers Private Licited
				<lb />
				(supra), wherein it is held that even if the Corporation violates the statutory procedure
				<lb />
				while demolishing a building, but the structure is illegal, the Court should not permit
				<lb />
				the illegal structure to be re-erected and it is only where the Court comes to a vnding
				<lb />
				that the structure was constructed legally, that it can after recording a clear cut vnding
				<lb />
				as to the dimensions of the structure, permit reconstruction.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				8.23.
				<lb />
				That the fact of the movables and articles allegedly damaged or
				<lb />
				destroyed during the demolition, the same is disputed as also its value. In the absence
				<lb />
				of proper proof, such allegations and claims for compensation for loss allegedly
				<lb />
				caused, cannot be entertained and adjudicated in the present proceedings.
				<lb />

				<lb />
				SUBMISSIONS MADE ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT NO. 4 :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.1.
				<lb />
				ihri iakhare, learned ienior Advocate appearing for Respondent No. 4,
				<lb />
				has submitted that the Petitioner has impugned the action taken by Respondent No. 4
				<lb />
				under iection 354A of the Act, in his ofcial capacity, on the ground of alleged
				<lb />
				malavdes against Respondent No. 4. He further submitted that Respondent No. 4
				<lb />
				adopts the submissions of MCGM and makes further submissions as follows :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.2.
				<lb />
				The Petitioner who never added Respondent No. 4 as a party and had no
				<lb />
				allegations against Respondent No. 4 even after an exhaustive amendment to the Writ
				<lb />
				Petition, vnally sought to take refuge under &apos;malice in fact&apos; against Respondent No. 4.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.3.
				<lb />
				The allegations of malice in fact cannot be gone into under the Writ
				<lb />
				jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.4.
				<lb />
				The allegations of malavdes are vague, general in nature and without
				<lb />
				material particulars.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.5.
				<lb />
				The allegations of &apos;malice in law&apos; can only be made against the itate and
				<lb />
				therefore by adding Respondent No. 4 as a party in his personal / individual capacity,
				<lb />
				the Petitioner has sought to lay the foundation of the challenge on the principle of
				<lb />
				&apos;malice in fact&apos;.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.6.
				<lb />
				The iupreme Court in the case of The Regional Manager &amp; Anr. v/s.
				<lb />
				Pawan Kucar Dubey 25 has held as under :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				25
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(1976) 3 iCC 334, para 15
				<lb />
				&quot;15. We repeat that啾 before any sufh fase of &quot;malife in law&quot; fan be
				<lb />
				affepted啾 the person who alleges it must satisfaftorily establish it on
				<lb />
				proved or admitted fafts as it was in Kulkarni&apos;s fase. Where the
				<lb />
				allegations are of malife in faft啾 whifh are generally seriously
				<lb />
				disputed and the fase fannot be satisfaftorily defided without a
				<lb />
				detailed adduftion of evidenfe or fross-examination of witnesses啾
				<lb />
				fourts will leave the party agrieved to an ordinary fivil suit. This
				<lb />
				rule啾 relating to exerfise of disfretionary powers under Artifle 226啾 is
				<lb />
				also well settled. &quot;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.7.
				<lb />
				The allegations of &apos;malice in fact&apos; thus cannot be gone into by this Court
				<lb />
				in Writ jurisdiction and given the pleadings of the Petitioner on the issue of &apos;malice in
				<lb />
				fact&apos;, her case, as it stands, deserves dismissal in limine.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.8.
				<lb />
				The iupreme Court in the case of Rajneesh Khajuria v/s. Wofkhardt
				<lb />
				Licited &amp; Anr. (supra) has approved its earlier Judgment in the case of HMT Licited
				<lb />
				v/s. Mudappa 26 and held that malice in fact cannot be attributed to the itate and it
				<lb />
				could only be &apos;malice in law&apos;. The relevant passage of the Judgment reads as under :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;It was observed that where malife was attributed to the State啾 it
				<lb />
				fould not be a fase of malife in faft啾 or personal ill will or spite on part
				<lb />
				of the State. &quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				9.9.
				<lb />
				Therefore, the law as it stands requires detailed adducing of evidence
				<lb />
				and cross-examination of witnesses for malice in fact to be proved and therefore the
				<lb />
				Petitioners case deserves a discountenance at the threshold.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				26
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.10.
				<lb />
				The case of &apos;malice in fact&apos; in fact requires clear and specivc allegations
				<lb />
				of personal bias or oblique motives, and ought not to be entertained on the basis of
				<lb />
				general and vague allegations made against the Respondents or on mere conjectures or
				<lb />
				surmises. The Petitioner has made vague and general allegations of malavdes without
				<lb />
				giving any material particulars thereof.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.11.
				<lb />
				The only specivc reference to Respondent No. 4 is at paragraph 2A of
				<lb />
				the Writ Petition, the relevant portion of which reads as under :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;2A. Respondent No. 4 is the designated offer of Respondent No. 1.
				<lb />
				He has malafidely issued the impugned notife dated 07/09/2020 and
				<lb />
				has passed the impugned order dated 09/09/2020 and has afted in the
				<lb />
				manner as set out hereinafter. He is added herein in his individual
				<lb />
				fapafity. The Respondent No. 5….&quot;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.12.
				<lb />
				This obscurity of the Petitioner in fact brings to light one aspect that the
				<lb />
				Petitioner has no case, even after two amendments to the Writ Petition and an array of
				<lb />
				Rejoinder and iur-iur Rejoinder, to prove her case.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.13.
				<lb />
				When a person comes with a case of malavdes, there is a heavy burden
				<lb />
				of proof on the person, who alleges such malavdes and in the present case, the
				<lb />
				Petitioner has not adduced any proof to substantiate the allegations of malavdes.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.14.
				<lb />
				The iupreme Court in Ajit Kucar Nag v/s. General Manager (PJ),
				<lb />
				Indian Oil Corpn. Haldia &amp; Ors. 27 , has held as under :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;56…….It is will settled that the burden of proving malafide is on
				<lb />
				27
				<lb />
				(2005) 7 iCC 764 at para 56
				<lb />
				the person making the allegations and the burden is &apos;very heavy&apos;.
				<lb />
				(vide E.P.Royappa v. State of T.N.). There is every presumption in
				<lb />
				favour of the administration that the power has been exerfised
				<lb />
				bonafide and in good faith. It is to be remembered that the allegation
				<lb />
				of malafide are often more easily made than made out and the very
				<lb />
				seriousness of sufh allegations demands proof of a high degree of
				<lb />
				fredibility. As Krishna Iyer J. stated in Gulac Mustafa vs. State
				<lb />
				of Maharashtra (SCC p. 802 para 2) : &quot;It (malafide) is the last
				<lb />
				refuge of a losing litigant.&quot;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.15.
				<lb />
				The Petitioner has neither made any specivc averments nor adduced any
				<lb />
				material / proof / document against Respondent No. 4 to prove and / or establish that
				<lb />
				the action of Respondent No. 4 was borne out of any malavde, malice, ill-will or spite
				<lb />
				that Respondent No. 4 has in his individual capacity qua the Petitioner.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.16.
				<lb />
				In the case of E.P.Royappa v/s. State of Tacil Nadu and Others 28 ,
				<lb />
				decided by a vve Judge Bench of the iupreme Court, it has been held as under :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;92. Sefondly啾 we must not also overlook that the burden of
				<lb />
				establishing malafides in very heavy on the person who alleges it. The
				<lb />
				allegations of malafides are often more easily made than proved啾 and
				<lb />
				the very seriousness of sufh allegations demands proof of a high order
				<lb />
				of fredibility.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				…..Sufh is the judifial perspeftive in evaluating fharges of unworthy
				<lb />
				fonduft against ministers and other high authorities啾 not befause of
				<lb />
				any spefial status whifh they are supposed to enjoy啾 nor befause they
				<lb />
				are highly plafed in sofial life or administrative set up -these
				<lb />
				28
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				(1974) 4 iCC 3 para 92
				<lb />
				fonsiderations are wholly irrelevant in judifial approafh but befause
				<lb />
				otherwise, funftioning efeftively would befoce diffult in a
				<lb />
				decofrafy. It is from this standpoint that we must assess that merits
				<lb />
				of the allegations of malafides made by the petitioner against the
				<lb />
				sefond respondent. &quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				9.17.
				<lb />
				All the steps / action under iection 354A of the Act have been taken by
				<lb />
				Respondent No. 4 in his ofcial capacity as a Designated Ofcer of MCGM, and are in
				<lb />
				accordance with law.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				9.18.
				<lb />
				The inspection conducted by Respondent No. 4 on 7 th ieptember, 2020
				<lb />
				revealed large scale unlawful additions and alterations and also 5-6 workmen engaged
				<lb />
				in doing vnishing work almost throughout the premises. Materials such as plywood
				<lb />
				and construction debris were found on the premises and for this reason Respondent
				<lb />
				No. 4 issued the impugned Notice under iection 354A of the Act. The Petitioner in
				<lb />
				her Reply (through her Advocate), neither contended that the ongoing work had been
				<lb />
				stopped, nor produced any permission for the said work. iince the reply of the
				<lb />
				Petitioner was evasive, devoid of any merit and ex-facie fallacious, contending that no
				<lb />
				work was going on (per contra in the Petition, it is alleged that waterproovng work was
				<lb />
				going on), Respondent No. 4 has passed a speaking Order for demolition action under
				<lb />
				iection 354A (2) of the Act.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.19.
				<lb />
				It is therefore clear that the action taken by Respondent No. 4 is in
				<lb />
				bonavde discharge of his statutory duties and in his ofcial capacity as the Designated
				<lb />
				Ofcer, H/West.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.20.
				<lb />
				The present facts reveal that it is a clear case where the allegations of
				<lb />
				malavdes have been resorted to as the last refuge of a losing litigant and apart from
				<lb />
				being vague, general in nature, devoid of material particulars and / or without any
				<lb />
				proof, are entirely false and misconceived.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9.21.
				<lb />
				The Writ Petition is therefore not maintainable and even otherwise,
				<lb />
				devoid of any merit and liable to be dismissed.

				<lb />
				SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT NO. 5 :

			</p>
			<p>
				10.1.
				<lb />
				Respondent No. 5, ihri ianjay Raut, who has been impleaded in the

				Court, vled his Afdavit in Reply on 28 th ieptember, 2020, and made the following
				<lb />
				submissions on 5 th / 30 th October, 2020.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				10.2.
				<lb />
				The present Writ Petition involves various disputed questions of facts,
				<lb />
				which cannot be adjudicated under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Hence,
				<lb />
				the above Writ Petition deserves to be dismissed with costs.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				10.3.
				<lb />
				Respondent No. 5 is not concerned with the action of demolition taken
				<lb />
				by MCGM and the present dispute is only between the Petitioner and the Respondent
				<lb />
				Nos. 1 and 2, where Respondent No. 5 has been unnecessarily dragged.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				10.4.
				<lb />
				The action initiated by MCGM under the Act is an independent action
				<lb />
				and the same cannot be said to have been initiated at the behest of Respondent No. 5.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				10.5.
				<lb />
				Respondent No. 5 is neither the complainant nor is he concerned with
				<lb />
				the action taken against the Petitioner in any manner and therefore he cannot be made
				<lb />
				liable for payment of compensation to the Petitioner.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				10.6.
				<lb />
				The Petitioner has not stated as to how Respondent No. 5 is concerned
				<lb />
				with the facts involved in the present Writ Petition and it appears that Respondent No.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				5 has been impleaded in the above Writ Petition as a Respondent only to fulvll some
				<lb />
				ulterior motives of the Petitioner.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				10.7.
				<lb />
				Except vague allegation at page, 8, paragraph No. 4A of the Writ
				<lb />
				Petition, which is also repeated on Page 25 of the Writ Petition, there is no other
				<lb />
				averment made against Respondent No. 5.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				10.8.
				<lb />
				Respondent No. 5 has, in his Afdavit dated 28 th ieptember, 2020,
				<lb />
				denied the allegation that he has threatened the Petitioner in a news video channel
				<lb />
				&apos;News Nation&apos;.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				10.9.
				<lb />
				Respondent No. 5 has not in any manner threatened the Petitioner and
				<lb />
				has only expressed his opinion regarding the dishonesty of the Petitioner in response
				<lb />
				to her statement, wherein she compared Mumbai to Pak Occupied Kashmir.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				10.10.
				<lb />
				Respondent No. 5 has only responded to the derogatory statements
				<lb />
				made by the Petitioner insulting the itate of Maharashtra and Mumbai.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				10.11.
				<lb />
				Respondent No. 5 never responded to any of the tweets of the Petitioner,
				<lb />
				and it is falsely contended that in relation to the statement made by the Petitioner on
				<lb />
				5 th ieptember, 2020, Respondent No. 5 has threatened the Petitioner.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				10.12.
				<lb />
				In so far as malice in fact is concerned, the Petitioner is not only required
				<lb />
				to aver the same specivcally, but heavy burden lies on her to prove the same, as held in
				<lb />
				the case of Regional Manager v/s. Pawan Kucar Dubey (supra).
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				10.13.
				<lb />
				The iupreme Court in case of Ratnagiri Gas &amp; Power Private Licited
				<lb />
				v/s. RDS Projefts Licited 29 has held as follows :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;24. Even otherwise the findings reforded by the High Court on the
				<lb />
				question of malafides do not appear to us to be faftually or legally
				<lb />
				sustainable. While we do not fonsider it nefessary to delve deep into
				<lb />
				this aspeft of the fontroversy啾 we may point out that allegations of
				<lb />
				malafides are more easily made than proved. The law fasts a heavy
				<lb />
				burden on the person alleging malafide to prove the same on the basis
				<lb />
				of fafts that are either admitted or satisfaftorily established and / or
				<lb />
				logifal inferenfes dedufible from the same. This is partifularly so
				<lb />
				when the petitioner alleges malife in faft in whifh event it is
				<lb />
				obligatory for the person making any sufh allegation to furnish
				<lb />
				partifulars that would prove malafide on the part of the defision
				<lb />
				maker. Vague and general allegations unsupported by the requisite
				<lb />
				partifulars do not provide a sound basis for the fourt to fonduft an
				<lb />
				inquiry into their verafity. The legal position in this regard is fairly
				<lb />
				well-settled by a long line of defision of this Court&quot;.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				10.14.
				<lb />
				The Petitioner has impleaded Respondent No. 5, probably in order to
				<lb />
				divert the attention from the fact that the Petitioner had carried out unauthorized
				<lb />
				construction, which is demolished by MCGM.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				10.15.
				<lb />
				The Petitioner is not entitled to any relief against Respondent No. 5 in
				<lb />
				29
				<lb />
				(2013) 1 iCC 524
				<lb />
				the absence of pleadings against Respondent No. 5 and the above Writ Petition
				<lb />
				deserves to be dismissed with heavy compensatory costs.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				10.16.
				<lb />
				As set out earlier, Respondent No. 5 has not dealt with the additional
				<lb />
				documents tendered in Court by the Petitioner at the instance of this Court and since
				<lb />
				the same were not dealt with in the written submissions of Respondent No. 5 dated 5 th
				<lb />
				October, 2020, this Court informed the same to the Advocate for Respondent No. 5
				<lb />
				and gave an opportunity to vle further written submissions to Respondent No. 5 with
				<lb />
				regard to the same. Thereupon, the Advocate for Respondent No. 5 vled additional
				<lb />
				written submissions on behalf of Respondent No. 5 dated 30 th October, 2020, wherein
				<lb />
				it is submitted as follows :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				i.
				<lb />
				The tweets made by Petitioner do not form a part of the pleadings in the
				<lb />
				Writ Petition and Respondent No. 5 has not made any tweets against the Petitioner.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				ii.
				<lb />
				The news report published in the newspaper daily &apos;iaamna&apos; on 5 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020, states that the Maharashtra Home Minister has stated that if the
				<lb />
				Petitioner does not feel safe in Mumbai, she has no right to stay in Maharashtra. The
				<lb />
				said news report is also not part of the pleadings in the Writ Petition and hence this
				<lb />
				Court may not take any cognizance of the same.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				11.
				<lb />
				The Scheme of Section 351 and Section 354A of the Mumbai
				<lb />
				Municipal Corporation Act, 1888.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				11.1.
				<lb />
				The Petitioner has submitted that assuming (though denying) that the
				<lb />
				works carried out by the Petitioner were unauthorized, since every work set out /
				<lb />
				listed in the impugned Notice was completed and therefore existing / in-existence
				<lb />
				prior to the inspection and issuance of the impugned Notice, MCGM was required to
				<lb />
				give 7 days time, as well as a personal hearing to the Petitioner to enable her to take
				<lb />
				action as permissible in law, including seeking regularization of such internal works
				<lb />
				under iection 53 (3) of the MRTP Act, 1966. As against this, MCGM has submitted
				<lb />
				that the alleged unauthorized works were &apos;ongoing&apos; and therefore only 24 hours&apos;
				<lb />
				notice was required to be issued and due to this they issued notice to the Petitioner
				<lb />
				under iection 354A of the Act. For better appreciation of the facts in the present case
				<lb />
				narrated hereinabove, as also the above submissions / claims of the Petitioner and
				<lb />
				MCGM respectively, before we proceed to examine whether the alleged unauthorized
				<lb />
				works were &apos;Existing works&apos; or &apos;Ongoing works&apos;, as well as the conduct of the
				<lb />
				Respondents, we deem it necessary at the outset, to explain hereunder the icheme of
				<lb />
				iection 351 and iection 354A of the Act :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				11.2.
				<lb />
				Section 342 of the Act makes it mandatory for every person who intends
				<lb />
				to make any additions to a building, or change its existing user, or make any alterations
				<lb />
				or repairs to a building involving removal, alteration or re-erection of any part of the
				<lb />
				building, except tenantable repairs, to give notice to the Commissioner in a form
				<lb />
				prescribed under iection 344, and after the Commissioner signives in writing his
				<lb />
				approval for the work or fails to intimate in writing his disapproval of it, as provided
				<lb />
				under iection 345, can such work be carried out. Only after such approval or failure to
				<lb />
				intimate disapproval, the work can be commenced at any time within one year and
				<lb />
				with a notice of not more than seven clear days to the Municipal City Engineer of the
				<lb />
				proposed date of commencement as required by iection 347 of the Act. iection 342
				<lb />
				has a proviso which prevents any work of lowering of plinth, foundation or foor in a
				<lb />
				building under the scheme of these provisions.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				11.3.
				<lb />
				There are two remedial provisions in the MMC Act, in addition to the
				<lb />
				provisions under the MRTP Act, which authorize the Commissioner to act when work
				<lb />
				described in iection 342 is unlawfully commenced or carried on by any person. These
				<lb />
				are iection 351 and iection 354A of the Act.
				<lb />
				Under Section 351, if execution of any work as is described in iection 342 is
				<lb />
				commenced contrary to the provisions of iection 342 or 347, the Commissioner is
				<lb />
				required to serve a written notice requiring the person executing such work, to show
				<lb />
				within seven days of service of the written notice, sufcient cause why such work
				<lb />
				should not be removed, altered or pulled down. The Commissioner has an option to
				<lb />
				require such person, either personally or by an authorized agent, to attend and show
				<lb />
				such cause. Upon failure of such person to show sufcient cause, the Commissioner is
				<lb />
				empowered to remove, alter or pull down the work.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				Section 354A, on the other hand, empowers the Commissioner to stop any work
				<lb />
				described in iection 342, if he is satisved that such work has been unlawfully
				<lb />
				commenced or is being unlawfully carried on upon any premises. If it is not so stopped
				<lb />
				or permission for its execution is not produced within twenty-four hours from service
				<lb />
				of such stop-work notice, the Commissioner has the power, under sub-section (2) of
				<lb />
				iection 354A, to remove or pull down such work without further notice.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				11.4.
				<lb />
				Though there is some apparent overlap between the provisions of
				<lb />
				iections 351 and 354A, since both use the phrase &quot;any such work is…. commenced&quot;
				<lb />
				as the starting point for any action to be initiated thereunder, there is an obvious
				<lb />
				diference between the two. iuch diference has also been judicially noticed. Before we
				<lb />
				turn to the judicial pronouncements on the subject, we may formulate these
				<lb />
				diferences simply from the language employed in the two iections and their context.
				<lb />
				These are as follows:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(i)
				<lb />
				Section 351 contemplates a ihow Cause Notice when
				<lb />
				execution of any work described in iection 342 is commenced
				<lb />
				contrary to the provisions of iection 342 or 347, that is to say,
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(a)
				<lb />
				Without notice to the Commissioner, or
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(b)
				<lb />
				Without approval or want of intimation of
				<lb />
				disapproval from the Commissioner within thirty days of
				<lb />
				such notice, or
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(c) After one year from the date of delivery of such notice,
				<lb />
				or
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(d) Without notice of the proposed date of
				<lb />
				commencement for such work to the city engineer, or
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(e)
				<lb />
				After seven days of notice of intimation to the city
				<lb />
				engineer of the proposed date of commencement.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(ii) Section 354A, on the other hand contemplates a stop-
				<lb />
				work notice upon unlawful commencement or carrying
				<lb />
				on of any work described in iection 342. Though both
				<lb />
				the iections refer to commencement of the ofending
				<lb />
				work, by its very nature, iection 354A refers to on-going
				<lb />
				work, whereas iection 351 refers to completed (whether
				<lb />
				fully or partially) work, which is proposed to be removed,
				<lb />
				altered or pulled down, if no sufcient cause is shown.
				<lb />
				The ihow Cause Notice to be given under iection 351, is
				<lb />
				for work commenced contrary to the provisions of
				<lb />
				iections 342 or 347. Unlike in the case of iection 354A,
				<lb />
				under iection 351 there is no requirement of the
				<lb />
				Commissioner&apos;s satisfaction about the commencement
				<lb />
				being unlawful. This is but natural, since iection 351
				<lb />
				contemplates a show cause notice and the satisfaction of
				<lb />
				the Commissioner can come only after such cause is
				<lb />
				shown, whereas iection 354A contemplates the initial
				<lb />
				action of stoppage of work, which is a direct interference
				<lb />
				with the work, to be preceded by the Commissioner&apos;s
				<lb />
				satisfaction. In other words, whereas a mere reason to
				<lb />
				believe is sufcient to warrant a notice under iection 351,
				<lb />
				for any notice under iection 354A, there must be
				<lb />
				satisfaction of breach of law.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(iii) Under iection 354A, the Commissioner is empowered to
				<lb />
				act (under sub-section 2) by removing or pulling down
				<lb />
				the work, if the work is not stopped, or permission
				<lb />
				approved by the competent authority for execution of
				<lb />
				such work is not produced within twenty-four hours. In
				<lb />
				other words, if the person executing the work stops the
				<lb />
				work, or in the alternative produces authorization for the
				<lb />
				work, the Commissioner cannot proceed to remove or
				<lb />
				pull down the work.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				11.5.
				<lb />
				This scheme of iections 351 and 354A has been explained in various
				<lb />
				judicial pronouncements. The leading authority on this subject is the Judgement of
				<lb />
				the iupreme Court in Muni Suvrat Swaci Jain v/s. Arun Gaikwad (supra), where,
				<lb />
				whilst noticing the diference between iections 351 and 354A of the Act, the Court
				<lb />
				observed as follows:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;53.) It is seen that no notife under the provisions of Seftion 351
				<lb />
				has been issued by the Munifipal Coccissioner in this catter
				<lb />
				against the appellant. In the spefial leave petition, it is flearly
				<lb />
				centioned by the appellant that the Corporation had issued a
				<lb />
				notife to stop the work under Seftion 354A of the BMC Aft. No
				<lb />
				referenfe is cade to any notife under Seftion 351 of the Aft. It is
				<lb />
				spefififally mentioned that the afdavit whifh was filed on behalf of
				<lb />
				the Corporation had fategorifally stated that after the servife of stop-
				<lb />
				work notife under Seftion 354A no work was farried out. Respondent
				<lb />
				1 is fully aware that the provisions of Seftion 354A of the Aft
				<lb />
				deals with stopcwork notife whereas the provisions of Seftion 351
				<lb />
				of the Aft deals with showcfause notife for decolition of
				<lb />
				unauthorized strufture. The grievanfe of the appellant herein has
				<lb />
				been that without issuing a notife under Seftion 351 of the Aft and
				<lb />
				without giving an opportunity to the appellant of being heard the
				<lb />
				strufture of the temple fould not be ordered to be demolished by the
				<lb />
				High Court. The power under Seftion 351 of the Aft啾 in our opinion啾
				<lb />
				has to be exerfised only by the Munifipal Commissioner and it is left to
				<lb />
				the Munifipal Commissioner under the provisions of Seftion 351 (2)
				<lb />
				either to order or not to order the demolition of alleged unauthorized
				<lb />
				temple. In faft啾 Respondent 1 by himself through his advofate&apos;s letter
				<lb />
				dated 16-4-2005 (annexed to his founter-afdavit) requested the
				<lb />
				munifipal authorities to take aftion under Seftion 351 of the Aft. At
				<lb />
				the time of admission of this spefial leave petition啾 the provisions of
				<lb />
				Seftion 351 of the Aft was pointed out by the learned Senior Counsel to
				<lb />
				show that the Munifipal Commissioner had only been fonferred the
				<lb />
				power under the said provisions to demolish or not to demolish
				<lb />
				unauthorized strufture and啾 therefore啾 the High Court ought not to
				<lb />
				have issued mandamus for demolition of the temple before any order
				<lb />
				was passed by the Commissioner on the question of demolition. The
				<lb />
				provisions of Seftion 354A have nothing to do with the question of
				<lb />
				demolition.&quot;
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				11.6.
				<lb />
				In Abdul Razzaq Sunesra v/s. MCGM (supra), after referring to
				<lb />
				iections 351 and 354A, this Court observed the distinction in the following words:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;9.) This provision啾 as noted in the judgement of the Supreme Court
				<lb />
				in Muni Suvrat-Swami Jain S.M.P Sangh v. Arun Nathuram
				<lb />
				Gaikwad啾 2007 (2) Mh.L.J. (S.C.) 8 : (2006) 8 SCC 590 Paragraph
				<lb />
				57 on pages 611 and 612 fonfers an enabling power on the
				<lb />
				Commissioner and a disfretion if suffient fause is not shown啾
				<lb />
				whether or not to demolish the unauthorized fonstruftion. Similarly啾
				<lb />
				under Seftion 354A啾 if the designated offer is satisfied that the
				<lb />
				ereftion of a building or exefution of a work has been unlawfully
				<lb />
				fommenfed or is being unlawfully farried on啾 he may issue a notife to
				<lb />
				stop sufh ereftion of work forthwith…&quot;
				<lb />
				&quot;10.) Sub-seftion (2) of Seftion 354A deals with a situation where
				<lb />
				the ereftion of a building or exefution of a work is not stopped upon
				<lb />
				refeipt of a notife or where the person to whom the notife is addressed
				<lb />
				does not produfe the approval of the fompetent authority within 24
				<lb />
				hours. In sufh fase啾 the designated offer is authorized啾 without
				<lb />
				further notife啾 to remove or pull down the building or the work.
				<lb />
				Seftion 354A evidently applies to emergent situations where the
				<lb />
				designated offer fonsiders it nefessary to stop work whifh has been
				<lb />
				unlawfully fommenfed or work whifh has been unlawfully farried out
				<lb />
				despite issuanfe of a stop work notife.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				12.
				<lb />
				The authorities quoted above, make the following position clear :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				i.
				<lb />
				iection 354A primarily deals with a stop work notice, whereas iection
				<lb />
				351 deals with a show cause notice for demolition of an unauthorized structure;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				ii.
				<lb />
				iection 354A applies to ongoing work; it applies to emergent situations
				<lb />
				where the designated ofcer considers it necessary to stop such ongoing work which
				<lb />
				has been unlawfully commenced, or which is being unlawfully carried out despite
				<lb />
				issuance of a stop work notice.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				iii.
				<lb />
				For any unauthorized work already carried out, the Commissioner must
				<lb />
				resort to his power under iection 351 and not under iection 354A.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				13.
				<lb />
				Guidelines laid down by MCGM in its Circular dated 15 th March,
				<lb />
				2012 and relied upon by MCGM itself in the present matter :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				13.1.
				<lb />
				The MCGM, perhaps keeping in mind the aforestated apparent overlap
				<lb />
				between the provisions of iections 351 and 354A of the Act, in supersession of its
				<lb />
				earlier instructions, has laid down guidelines for the guidance of its staf in its Circular
				<lb />
				dated 15 th March, 2012. These guidelines provide for procedure to be followed for
				<lb />
				actions to be taken under iections 354A and 351. At the very outset, the guidelines
				<lb />
				distinguish between two diferent situations :
				<lb />
				Part A, deals with action under iection 354A and contains the procedure to be
				<lb />
				followed &quot;for on-going unauthorized fonstruftion&quot;, whilst
				<lb />
				Part B, deals with iection 351, and contains the procedure to be followed &quot;for existing
				<lb />
				unauthorized fonstruftion&quot;.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				Part A provides for a situation where &quot;any unauthorized construction is in
				<lb />
				progress contrary to the provisions of Sections 342 and 347 of the MMC Act and
				<lb />
				where change in foundation, plinth or structural addition, alteration, load bearing
				<lb />
				walls endangering the life and property of the occupiers or other persons is
				<lb />
				detected.&quot; (Emphasis supplied). The concerned ofcer detecting such work has
				<lb />
				then to take photographs showing the date and status of the work and prepare a
				<lb />
				Panchnama / Inspection Report &quot;of the work in progress&quot;. He then has to make an
				<lb />
				entry to that efect in the Detection Register and then prepare a notice under Section
				<lb />
				354A of the Act.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				13.2.
				<lb />
				On the other hand, for existing unauthorized construction, the staf of
				<lb />
				MCGM is mandated to proceed under iection 351, requiring the owner / occupier of
				<lb />
				unauthorized construction to show within 7 days&apos; time, that the work complained of is
				<lb />
				&quot;carried out in accordance with the provisions of iections 337, 342 and iection 347 of
				<lb />
				the MMC Act&quot;.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				13.3.
				<lb />
				The Circular of 15 th March, 2012, thus, makes it very clear when and
				<lb />
				how, consistent with the purpose of iection 354A discussed above, the MCGM&apos;s staf
				<lb />
				should resort to a notice under iection 354A.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				14.
				<lb />
				Whether the &apos;unauthorized works&apos; carried out by the Petitioner were
				<lb />
				completed and therefore &apos;Existing&apos; on the date of issue of the impugned Notice,
				<lb />
				or as alleged by the MCGM were &quot;in progress&quot;, justifying the issuance of notice
				<lb />
				to the Petitioner under Section 354A of the Act ?
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				14.1.
				<lb />
				The Petitioner approached this Court in the morning of 9 th ieptember,
				<lb />
				2020, with the present Writ Petition, which was prepared in immense haste and in the
				<lb />
				absence of the Petitioner in Mumbai. However, in this Writ Petition itself it was
				<lb />
				averred on behalf of the Petitioner as follows :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;….Respondent No. 2 (MCGM) has purported that the Petitioner is
				<lb />
				farrying out work in the Suit premises啾 whereas in reality no work is
				<lb />
				being farried out. &quot;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;….the fonflusion arrived at in the impugned notife that the
				<lb />
				Petitioner has farried out unauthorized development or is farrying out
				<lb />
				an unlawful ereftion or building is perverse and based upon improper
				<lb />
				and prejudifial surmises.&quot;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				14.2.
				<lb />
				In the amended Writ Petition, the Petitioner has interalia categorically
				<lb />
				stated that :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				i.
				<lb />
				&quot;In January, 2020啾 the interior designing of the said bungalow was fully
				<lb />
				focpleted by one design and arfhiteft fonsultanfy firm falled The Orange Lane LLP (&quot;said
				<lb />
				Firm&quot;). The Petitioner spent fonsiderable monies towards renovating the said bungalow to
				<lb />
				ensure that she fould fonveniently work therefrom. The defor of the said bungalow refeived
				<lb />
				mufh apprefiation from all and was widely publifized.&quot; (emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				ii.
				<lb />
				&quot;The Petitioner&apos;s said bungalow also featured in a leading interior défor
				<lb />
				magazine falled Elle Defor in their April-May 2020 Issue where she opened up about the
				<lb />
				interiors of her new work plafe.&quot;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				iii.
				<lb />
				&quot;The Petitioner also fondufted a Makarsankranti puja feremony at the said
				<lb />
				bungalow in the month of January啾 2020 after the works and renovation was &quot;fully
				<lb />
				focpleted&quot;. This puja also refeived wide publifity and was reported in various online
				<lb />
				artifles. &quot;
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				iv.
				<lb />
				&quot;It is evident from the pooja photographs and magazine photographs that
				<lb />
				there was no ereftion of work or unlawful fommenfement / farrying on of work being farried
				<lb />
				out by the Petitioner. Furthermore啾 the photographs in the magazine Elle Defor edition of
				<lb />
				April-May 2020啾 whifh was published way before the Impugned Notife was issued by the
				<lb />
				Respondent No.1啾 demonstrates that the said Premises was fully focpleted in tercs of all
				<lb />
				works and there was no further requirecent by the Petitioner to farry out work
				<lb />
				therein. &quot;
				<lb />
				(emphasis applied)
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				v.
				<lb />
				&quot;The photographs annexed to the impugned notife is mere photo of one person啾
				<lb />
				who was trying to fontrol / prevent the leakage whifh had taken plafe啾 by doing
				<lb />
				waterproofing as stated above. The fause of leakage was infessant rains that had happened
				<lb />
				during the fourse of monsoon in Mumbai. It is also pertinent that while啾 the MCGM has
				<lb />
				listed out 14 alleged works ongoing in the said bungalow at Item 7 whifh were allegedly said
				<lb />
				to be &apos;fommenfed/unlawfully farried on&apos;啾 there is only one photo of 1 person annexed to the
				<lb />
				Impugned Notife whifh is just the photo of person trying to prevent leakage from the monsoon
				<lb />
				rains. &quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>

			<p>
				14.5.
				<lb />
				Items &apos;a&apos; to &apos;d&apos; in the impugned Notice pertain to portions of the
				<lb />
				premises on the ground foor of the said Bungalow. We vrst propose to deal with Item
				<lb />
				&apos;d&apos; and will thereafter proceed to deal with Items &apos;a&apos; to &apos;c&apos; and then Item &apos;e&apos; onwards.

				<lb />
				Item &apos;d&apos; in the impugned Notice dated 7 th ieptember, 2020 reads thus :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;d) Unauthorised Pantry is fonstrufted on ground foor.&quot;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>

				<lb />
				The following photograph of the Pantry on the ground foor complete in
				<lb />
				all respects appeared in the April-May 2020 Issue of the Elle Decor Magazine :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				ii.
				<lb />
				The said Pantry on the ground foor of the said Bungalow was complete
				<lb />
				in all respects and ready for use on the date of publication of the above photograph, as
				<lb />
				is clear from the description given on the right side of the above photograph. The said
				<lb />
				description is reproduced hereunder for convenient reading :

				<lb />
				In the handwritten inspection report prepared by ihri Late, Designated

				<lb />
				gate at ground foor is fhanged&quot;, thereby making it clear that there was no ongoing
				<lb />
				vnishing / renovation work being carried on, on the entire ground foor as alleged.
				<lb />
				Despite this, the above Pantry is mentioned as Item &apos;d&apos; in the ichedule to the
				<lb />
				impugned Notice issued under iection 354A of the Act, and contrary to the above
				<lb />
				recording in the handwritten inspection report prepared at site by the same ihri Late,
				<lb />
				it is now wrongly alleged in the impugned Notice dated 7 th ieptember, 2020, issued
				<lb />

				<lb />
				alteration and acalgacation work is in progress at G+2 Bungalow no. 5 without any
				<lb />
				percission froc focpetent authority.&quot; Needless to add that the MCGM has also not
				<lb />
				produced a single photograph showing any work being carried out by any person /
				<lb />
				workman on any portion on the ground foor, or atleast in respect of the said Pantry.
				<lb />
				However, MCGM after pasting the impugned Notice on the outer wall of the said
				<lb />
				Bungalow on 8 th ieptember, 2020 at 10.03 a.m. and before pasting the Order of
				<lb />
				demolition at 10.35 a.m. on 9 th ieptember, 2020 on the outer wall of the said
				<lb />
				Bungalow, had already made arrangements to carry out the demolition work and the
				<lb />
				Pantry was completely demolished by the time the Court commenced the hearing of
				<lb />
				the ad-interim application at 12.30 p.m. on 9 th ieptember, 2020, and before the
				<lb />
				Advocate for the MCGM conveyed the Order of this Court to forthwith stop
				<lb />
				demolition. The photographs of the demolition of the Pantry on the ground foor of
				<lb />
				the said Bungalow being carried out and completed, are shown hereunder :
				<lb />
				14.7.
				<lb />
				Item &apos;a&apos; in the impugned Notice dated 7 th ieptember, 2020 reads thus :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;a) Toilet unauthorizedly fonverted into offe fabin on ground foor&quot;.

				<lb />
				The photograph produced by the MCGM showing the work set out in

				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				ii.
				<lb />
				The above photograph taken by the MCGM on 7 th ieptember, 2020
				<lb />
				shows that the work is complete in all respects. The table, chairs, telephone, vles, air
				<lb />
				conditioner, cctv camera in the said Ofce Cabin on the ground foor shows that the
				<lb />
				same is in fact in use.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				iii.
				<lb />
				MCGM has neither set out any details nor have they produced any
				<lb />
				photograph of any ongoing work/s in the ground foor premises described in Item &apos;a&apos;
				<lb />
				of the impugned Notice.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				iv.
				<lb />
				In fact, the handwritten &apos;Inspection Report&apos; dated 7th ieptember, 2020,
				<lb />
				which was prepared by ihri Late and other ofcers of the MCGM at the said
				<lb />
				Bungalow and produced before this Court on 10 th ieptember, 2020, does not record
				<lb />
				that any renovation / vnishing work was ongoing on the ground foor. It is only alleged
				<lb />
				in the Report that, &quot;At frst &amp; sefond foor, internal renovation, fnishing work is
				<lb />
				found in progress. Position of the entranfe gate at ground foor is fhanged.&quot;

				<lb />
				been demolished.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				14.8.
				<lb />

			<p>
				&quot;b) Unauthorized kitfhen is fonstrufted in store rooc on ground foor&quot;.
				<lb />

			<p>
				i.
				<lb />
				The photograph produced by the MCGM showing the work set out in
				<lb />
				Item &apos;b&apos; of the impugned Notice as on 7 th ieptember, 2020 is reproduced hereunder :
				<lb />
				i.
				<lb />
				The above photograph taken by the MCGM on 7 th ieptember, 2020
				<lb />
				shows that the work is complete in all respects. The gas cylinder, the dust bin, the
				<lb />
				vessels on the kitchen platform, the refrigerator, the vre extinguisher etc., in the
				<lb />
				kitchen shows that the same is in fact in use.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				iii.
				<lb />
				MCGM has neither set out any details nor have they produced any
				<lb />
				photograph of any ongoing work/s in the ground foor premises described in Item &apos;b&apos;
				<lb />
				of the impugned Notice.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				iv.
				<lb />
				In fact, in the handwritten &apos;Inspection Report&apos; dated 7 th ieptember,
				<lb />
				2020 which was prepared by ihri Late and the ofcers of the MCGM at the said
				<lb />
				Bungalow and produced before this Court on 10 th ieptember, 2020, the same does not
				<lb />
				record that any renovation / vnishing work was ongoing on the ground foor. It is only
				<lb />
				alleged in the Report that, &quot;At frst and sefond foor, internal renovation, fnishing
				<lb />
				work is found in progress. Position of the entranfe gate is found fhanged.&quot;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				v.
				<lb />
				MCGM therefore ought not to have included the &apos;unauthorized&apos; kitchen
				<lb />
				on the ground foor as Item &apos;b&apos; in its impugned Notice.
				<lb />
				vi.
				<lb />
				However, in view of the ad-interim Order passed by this Court dated 9 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020, except for demolition of the entrance door to the kitchen described
				<lb />
				in Item &apos;b&apos; of the impugned Notice, nothing else has been demolished.
				<lb />

				<lb />
				Item &apos;c&apos; in the impugned Notice dated 7 th ieptember, 2020 reads thus :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;f) New toilets are unauthorizedly fonstrufted beside stairfase
				<lb />
				inside store and another in parking area on ground foor.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				i.
				<lb />
				From a plain reading of Item &apos;c&apos; hereinabove, it is clear that two toilets
				<lb />
				are included in Item &apos;c&apos;, i.e. one besides the staircase inside the store and another in
				<lb />
				the parking area on the ground foor. Under the Circular dated 15 th March, 2012, relied
				<lb />
				upon by the MCGM itself, MCGM is bound to take photographs of the ongoing
				<lb />
				works. This is so because the onus is on MCGM to show / establish that the
				<lb />
				&apos;unauthorized&apos; work is going on. MCGM has produced one photograph, that too the
				<lb />
				side view of the toilet besides the staircase inside the store on the ground foor. In view
				<lb />
				thereof the only photograph produced by the MCGM is reproduced hereunder :
				<lb />

			<p>
				iii.
				<lb />
				In fact, the handwritten &apos;Inspection Report&apos; dated 7th ieptember, 2020
				<lb />
				which was prepared by ihri Late and the ofcers of the MCGM at the said Bungalow
				<lb />
				and produced before this Court on 10 th ieptember, 2020, the same does not record

			<p>
				v.
				<lb />
				Admittedly, the south side wall / wooden partition between the living
				<lb />
				room and the discussion room on the vrst foor is common. However, no work was
				<lb />
				going on in the living room on 5 th / 7 th ieptember, 2020 and no workman was found in
				<lb />
				the said room which is independent of the discussion room. MCGM have not
				<lb />
				produced any photograph of any work being carried out in the living room or showing
				<lb />
				any workmen present in the living room. From the photographs produced by MCGM,
				<lb />
				on 5 th / 7 th ieptember, 2020, the workman (described as Workman No. 1 by MCGM)
				<lb />
				was carrying out some work on a ladder in the discussion room and next to him a box
				<lb />

				<lb />
				another workman (described as Workman No. 2 by MCGM) is seen sitting on the
				<lb />
				foor with a box of paint / polish but he does not appear to be doing any work. The
				<lb />
				Petitioner has explained in her Afdavit that the said Workman No. 2 was a helper to
				<lb />
				the Workman No. 1 -who is seen on the ladder. The photographs produced / relied
				<lb />

			<p>
				vi.
				<lb />
				Despite the living room and the discussion room being completed in all
				<lb />
				respects, MCGM by alleging that two persons / workmen were carrying out work in
				<lb />
				the discussion room, have included the living room as well as the discussion room in
				<lb />
				the impugned Notice by describing the same as &quot;e) Unauthorized room / fabin with
				<lb />
				wooden partition made in living room on first foor&quot;. Despite being independent of each
				<lb />
				other and fully completed and furnished atleast since April-May 2020, MCGM
				<lb />
				after pasting the impugned Notice on the outer wall of the said Bungalow on 8 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020 at 10.03 a.m., and before pasting the Order of demolition on 9 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020 on the outer wall of the said bungalow had already made

				<lb />
				as well as the discussion room were completely demolished by the time the Court
				<lb />
				commenced the ad-interim application at 12.30 p.m. on 9 th ieptember, 2020, and

				<lb />
				showing any ongoing work in the conference room on 5 th / 7 th ieptember, 2020 is

				The above photograph establishes that the work on the entire second

				MCGM in Items &apos;j&apos; and &apos;l&apos; of the impugned Notice dated 7 th ieptember, 2020 issued
				<lb />
				under iection 354A of the Act. MCGM has alleged that Workman Nos. 3, 4, 5 and a
				<lb />
				iite iupervisor were found in the said room/s. The photographs relied on by the
				<lb />
				MCGM are reproduced hereunder :
				<lb />
				According to the MCGM : -

				The man in pink shirt in photograph No. 1 is workman No. 3.

				<lb />
				The Workmen who are numbered as 3 and 4 by the MCGM, are

				MCGM and the workman described as Workman No.4 -ihri ihivam Rajil Varma, is
				<lb />
				the Caretaker of the said Bungalow and the person shown as Workman No. 5 is an

				electrician named Ishwar, who had come to check the dimmers. It is also submitted
				<lb />
				that ihri Nikhil iurve supervises the ofce and is always present in the said Bungalow

				&apos;unauthorized&apos; works, as per the Circular dated 15 th March, 2012 relied upon by
				<lb />
				MCGM, has itself not produced any photograph. The premises described in Item &apos;m&apos;
				<lb />
				is not demolished due to the ad-interim Order passed by this Court dated 9 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020. However, the Petitioner has produced the photograph of the

				<lb />
				As regards Item &apos;n&apos; of the impugned Notice dated 7 th ieptember, 2020,
				<lb />
				the MCGM who is required to take the photographs of all the &apos;unauthorized&apos; works
				<lb />
				alongwith the date and status of the work at the time of detection of such works, as per
				<lb />
				the Circular dated 15 th March, 2012 relied upon by MCGM, has itself not produced
				<lb />
				any photograph showing any ongoing works in respect to Item &apos;n&apos;. The premises
				<lb />
				described in Item &apos;n&apos; is not demolished due to the ad-interim Order passed by this
				<lb />
				Court dated 9 th ieptember, 2020.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				14.18.
				<lb />
				From the facts and photographs reproduced above, we have no doubt
				<lb />
				and we are sure that ihri Late and the ofcers of MCGM also had no doubt, that the
				<lb />
				works described in Items &apos;a&apos; to &apos;n&apos; of the ichedule to the impugned notice dated 7 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020 were all existing works completed in all respects much prior to the
				<lb />
				inspection taken on 5 th / 7 th ieptember, 2020, and except for one workman who
				<lb />
				alongwith his helper appears to be carrying out some painting / polishing /
				<lb />
				waterproovng work in the discussion room on the vrst foor which discussion room
				<lb />
				was also complete in all respects atleast by April-May 2020 (photograph at page 66
				<lb />
				hereinabove) there was no other work including any renovation and/or vnishing work
				<lb />
				going on in any part of the said bungalow, as alleged by MCGM or otherwise. MCGM
				<lb />
				therefore could never have issued a notice under iection 354A of the Act giving only
				<lb />
				24 hours to the Petitioner to respond to the allegations made therein. Even if the
				<lb />
				existing / completed works described in Items &apos;a&apos; to &apos;n&apos; of the schedule to the
				<lb />
				impugned notice were unauthorized, the work/s being completed and existing, ihri
				<lb />
				Late was bound to issue and serve the Petitioner with a notice under iection 351 of the
				<lb />
				Act giving seven days time to respond, including a personal hearing. ihri Late being
				<lb />
				aware of the above facts, has consciously not provided the required rough sketch of the
				<lb />
				unauthorized works either in the First Inspection Report or in the impugned notice
				<lb />
				both dated 7 th ieptember, 2020. ihri Late has also consciously not provided any other
				<lb />
				photographs of the alleged ongoing unauthorized works to the Petitioner alongwith the
				<lb />
				impugned notice dated 7 th ieptember, 2020 and has called upon the Petitioner to
				<lb />
				comply with the impugned notice, without informing her what according to him /
				<lb />
				MCGM were the ongoing unauthorized works in the entire bungalow. For the very
				<lb />
				same reason ihri Late despite having stated in his Afdavit dated 10 th ieptember,
				<lb />
				2020 that he has annexed thereto the photographs taken by him / his team during
				<lb />
				inspection of the said bungalow on 7 th ieptember, 2020 has not annexed a single
				<lb />
				photograph to his Afdavit with a view to delay the production of the same before the
				<lb />
				Court.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				14.19.
				<lb />
				ihri Late also failed to annex the photographs to his Afdavit dated 17 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020 and produced the same only when this Court through its Associate
				<lb />
				called upon the MCGM to do so. We have also set out hereinafter, how ihri Late
				<lb />
				belatedly made a statement for the vrst time in his Afdavit dated 24 th ieptember,
				<lb />
				2020 that the Mukadam too had taken photographs during the inspection of the said
				<lb />
				bungalow on 5 th ieptember, 2020 and when this Court called upon ihri Late on 25 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020 to produce the camera used by the Mukadam for taking the
				<lb />
				photographs, on 28 th ieptember, 2020, ihri Late who had throughout taken a stand
				<lb />
				that it was only the Mukadam who had visited the said bungalow on 5 th ieptember,
				<lb />
				2020, now through his Counsel retracted the earlier statements made by him on oath
				<lb />
				and stated that it was some other ofcer who had accompanied the Mukadam on 5 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020 and who had taken photographs. Besides this, in view of the facts set
				<lb />
				out hereinabove and the facts which will unfold hereinafter, it will be further
				<lb />
				established that ihri Late has also made an incorrect statement in his Afdavit dated
				<lb />
				17 th ieptember, 2020 that he found six workmen working in the said bungalow on 7 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				15.
				<lb />
				The much required clarifcation :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				15.1.
				<lb />
				Before proceeding further, we make it clear that this Court does not
				<lb />
				countenance unauthorized construction, and also does not approve of loose and
				<lb />
				irresponsible statements against any individual, authority or Government. We do not
				<lb />
				accept as true any of the statements/allegations made by the Petitioner through her
				<lb />
				tweets with regard to the alleged prevailing atmosphere in the itate or the itate Police
				<lb />
				or against the vlm industry. If anything, we are of the view that the Petitioner should
				<lb />
				be better advised to exercise restraint when &quot;as a publif spirited person&quot;, she &quot;airs her
				<lb />
				views regarding issues of publif importanfe on sofial media platforms啾 ….&quot;. We must,
				<lb />
				however, hasten to add that the subject matter of the controversy in the present
				<lb />
				Petition or, indeed, of the impugned Order of demolition / action on the part of
				<lb />
				Respondent Nos. 1 to 4, is not the tweets of the Petitioner but action on the part of an
				<lb />
				arm of the itate whilst dealing with a citizen. Irresponsible statements made by a
				<lb />
				citizen in an individual capacity, however distasteful or wrong they may be, are best
				<lb />
				ignored. Illegal and colourable action/s on part of the itate or its agencies vis-à-vis a
				<lb />
				citizen, is far too serious and damaging to society to be overlooked. Whatever be the
				<lb />
				folly of an individual, whether in the matter of unauthorized construction, or
				<lb />
				irresponsible statements hurting the sentiments of individuals or the public in general,
				<lb />
				no action against such individual by anyone, much less by the itate, can lie except
				<lb />
				within the four corners of law. By no means, colourable exercise of power or resort to
				<lb />
				threats, use of muscle power and/or causing of injury by unlawful means to such
				<lb />
				person or to his/her property, can be permitted in any civil society. iuch actions are
				<lb />
				the very antithesis of the rule of law.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				16.
				<lb />
				Malafde conduct: when can it be alleged :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				16.1.
				<lb />
				As stated hereinabove, it is contended on behalf of the Petitioner that the
				<lb />
				conduct of the Respondents smack of malavdes. In view thereof, before we proceed to
				<lb />
				set out in detail, the facts which led to the demolition of the said Bungalow, and decide
				<lb />
				whether the action of demolition of the said Bungalow may be termed as
				<lb />
				malavde/malicious, we vrst need to visit the law on the subject:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				16.2.
				<lb />
				As correctly submitted by the Advocates for the parties, malavde means
				<lb />
				want of good faith, personal bias, grudge, oblique or improper motive or ulterior
				<lb />
				purpose. An administrative authority must act in a bonavde manner and should never
				<lb />
				act with improper or ulterior motives, contrary to the requirements of the statute or
				<lb />
				circumstances contemplated by law, or improperly exercised discretion to achieve
				<lb />
				some ulterior purpose.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				16.3.
				<lb />
				For malice in fact, the same has to be expressly pleaded, alongwith the
				<lb />
				allegations in support thereof, and the concerned person also has to be impleaded.
				<lb />
				There is however an independent concept of malice in law. There cannot possibly be
				<lb />
				any set guidelines with regard to the proof of malavdes. Malavdes, whereever alleged,
				<lb />
				depend upon facts and circumstances of an individual case. The Court must scrutinize
				<lb />
				the factual spectrum and come to its own conclusion. Malice in law can be inferred
				<lb />
				from the doing of a wrongful act, without any just cause or excuse, or something done
				<lb />
				without lawful excuse. It is a deliberate act in disregard to the rights of others, the
				<lb />
				conscious violation of the law to the prejudice of another, a depraved inclination on
				<lb />
				the part of the authority to disregard the rights of others, which intent is manifested by
				<lb />
				its injurious acts. Malice in law does not even need to be pleaded.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				16.4.
				<lb />
				In Rajneesh Khajuria v/s. Wofkhardt Ltd (supra) the iupreme Court
				<lb />
				held as follows:
				<lb />
				&quot;16.) The aft of transfer fan be unfair labour praftife if the
				<lb />
				transfer is aftuated by mala fide. The allegations of mala fides
				<lb />
				have two fafets -one malife in law and the other being malife in
				<lb />
				faft. The fhallenge to the transfer is based upon malife in faft as it
				<lb />
				is an aftion taken by the employer on affount of two offers present
				<lb />
				in Conferenfe. In a judgment in State of Bihar v. P.P. Sharma
				<lb />
				[State of Bihar v. P.P. Sharma啾 1992 Supp (1) SCC 222 : 1992
				<lb />
				SCC (Cri) 192] 啾 this Court held that mala fide means want of
				<lb />
				good faith啾 personal bias啾 grudge啾 oblique or improper motive or
				<lb />
				ulterior purpose. The plea of mala fides involves two questions啾
				<lb />
				namely (i) whether there is a personal bias or an oblique motive啾
				<lb />
				and (ii) whether the administrative aftion is fontrary to the objefts啾
				<lb />
				requirements and fonditions of a valid exerfise of administrative
				<lb />
				power. As far as sefond aspeft is fonferned啾 there is a power of
				<lb />
				transfer vested in the employer in terms of letter of appointment.
				<lb />
				Even in terms of the provisions of the Aft啾 the transfer by itself
				<lb />
				fannot be said to be an aft of unfair labour praftife unless it is
				<lb />
				aftuated by mala fides. Therefore啾 to sustain a plea of mala fides啾
				<lb />
				there has to be an element of personal bias or an oblique motive.
				<lb />
				This Court held as under: (SCC pp. 260 &amp; 264-65啾 paras 50-51 &amp;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				59)
				<lb />
				&quot;50. Mala fdes ceans want of good faith, personal bias,
				<lb />
				grudge, oblique or icproper cotive or ulterior purpose. The
				<lb />
				adcinistrative aftion cust be said to be done in good faith, if
				<lb />
				it is in faft done honestly, whether it is done negligently or
				<lb />
				not. An aft done honestly is deeced to have been done in good
				<lb />
				faith. An adcinistrative authority cust, therefore, aft in a
				<lb />
				bona fde canner and should never aft for an icproper
				<lb />
				cotive or ulterior purposes or fontrary to the requirecents of
				<lb />
				the statute, or the basis of the firfucstanfes fontecplated by
				<lb />
				law, or icproperly exerfised disfretion to afhieve soce
				<lb />
				ulterior purpose. The detercination of a plea of cala fdes
				<lb />
				involves two questions, nacely (i) whether there is a personal
				<lb />
				bias or an oblique cotive, and (ii) whether the adcinistrative
				<lb />
				aftion is fontrary to the objefts, requirecents and fonditions
				<lb />
				of a valid exerfise of adcinistrative power.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				51. The aftion taken must啾 therefore啾 be proved to have been made
				<lb />
				mala fide for sufh fonsiderations. Mere assertion or a vague or bald
				<lb />
				statement is not suffient. It must be demonstrated either by
				<lb />
				admitted or proved fafts and firfumstanfes obtainable in a given
				<lb />
				fase. If it is established that the aftion has been taken mala fide for
				<lb />
				any sufh fonsiderations or by fraud on power or folourable exerfise
				<lb />
				of power啾 it fannot be allowed to stand.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				59. Malife in law fould be inferred from doing of wrongful aft
				<lb />
				intentionally without any just fause or exfuse or without there
				<lb />
				being reasonable relation to the purpose of the exerfise of statutory
				<lb />
				power. Malife in law is not established from the omission to
				<lb />
				fonsider some dofuments said to be relevant to the affused. Equally
				<lb />
				reporting the fommission of a frime to the Station House Offer啾
				<lb />
				fannot be held to be a folourable exerfise of power with bad faith or
				<lb />
				fraud on power. It may be honest and bona fide exerfise of power.
				<lb />
				There are no grounds made out or shown to us that the first
				<lb />
				information report was not lodged in good faith. State of Haryana
				<lb />
				v. Bhajan Lal [State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal啾 1992 Supp (1)
				<lb />
				SCC 335 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 426] is an authority for the
				<lb />
				proposition that existenfe of deep seated politifal vendetta is not a
				<lb />
				ground to quash the FIR. Therein despite the attempt by the
				<lb />
				respondent to prove by afdavit evidenfe forroborated by
				<lb />
				dofuments of the mala fides and even on fafts as alleged no ofenfe
				<lb />
				was fommitted啾 this Court deflined to go into those allegations and
				<lb />
				relegated the dispute for investigation. Unhesitatingly啾 I hold that
				<lb />
				the findings of the High Court [Prem Prakash Sharma v. State of
				<lb />
				Bihar啾 1990 SCC OnLine Pat 105 : (1990) 2 PLJR 404 (2)] that
				<lb />
				FIR gets vitiated by the mala fides of the Administrator and the
				<lb />
				fharge-sheets are the results of the mala fides of the informant or
				<lb />
				investigator啾 to say the least啾 is fantastif and obvious gross error of
				<lb />
				law.&quot;

				17.) In the matter of Prabodh Sagar v. Punjab SEB [Prabodh
				<lb />
				Sagar v. Punjab SEB啾 (2000) 5 SCC 630 : 2000 SCC (L&amp;S)
				<lb />
				731] 啾 it was held by this Court that the mere use of the expression啾
				<lb />
				&quot;mala fide&quot; would not by itself make the petition entertainable.
				<lb />
				The Court held as under: (SCC p. 640啾 para 13)
				<lb />
				&quot;13. … Infidentally啾 be it noted that the expression &quot;mala fide&quot; is
				<lb />
				not meaningless jargon and it has its proper fonnotation. Malife or
				<lb />
				mala fides fan only be apprefiated from the refords of the fase in
				<lb />
				the fafts of eafh fase. There fannot possibly be any set
				<lb />
				guidelines in regard to the proof of cala fdes. Mala fdes,
				<lb />
				where it is alleged, depends upon its own fafts and
				<lb />
				firfucstanfes…. There must be faftual support pertaining to the
				<lb />
				allegations of mala fides啾 unfortunately there is none. Mere user of
				<lb />
				the words &quot;mala fide&quot; by the petitioner would not by itself make
				<lb />
				the petition entertainable. The Court cust sfan the faftual
				<lb />
				aspeft and foce to its own fonflusion i.e. exaftly what the High

				State of A.P. v. Goverdhanlal Pitti [State of A.P. v. Goverdhanlal

				&quot;Legal calife&quot; or &quot;calife in law&quot; ceans &quot;socething done

				<lb />
				a deliberate aft in disregard of the rights of others.&quot;&apos;
				<lb />
				It was observed that where malife was attributed to the State啾 it
				<lb />
				fould not be a fase of malife in faft啾 or personal ill will or spite on
				<lb />
				the part of the State. It fould only be malife in law i.e. legal mala

				India v. Ashok Kumar啾 (2005) 8 SCC 760 : 2006 SCC (L&amp;S)
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				47] 啾 it has been held that allegations of mala fides are often more
				<lb />
				easily made than proved啾 and the very seriousness of sufh
				<lb />
				allegations demands proof of a high order of fredibility. The Court
				<lb />
				held as under: (SCC p. 770啾 para 21)
				<lb />
				&quot;21. Doubtless啾 he who seeks to invalidate or nullify any aft or
				<lb />
				order must establish the fharge of bad faith啾 an abuse or a misuse
				<lb />
				by the authority of its powers. While the indireft motive or purpose啾
				<lb />
				or bad faith or personal ill will is not to be held established exfept
				<lb />
				on flear proof thereof啾 it is obviously diffult to establish the state
				<lb />
				of a man&apos;s mind啾 for that is what the employee has to establish in
				<lb />
				this fase啾 though this may sometimes be done. The diffulty is not
				<lb />
				lessened when one has to establish that a person apparently afting
				<lb />
				on the legitimate exerfise of power has啾 in faft啾 been afting mala
				<lb />
				fide in the sense of pursuing an illegitimate aim. It is not the law
				<lb />
				that cala fdes in the sense of icproper cotive should be
				<lb />
				established only by direft evidenfe. But it cust be disfernible
				<lb />
				froc the order icpugned or cust be shown froc the
				<lb />
				established surrounding faftors whifh prefeded the order. If
				<lb />
				bad faith would vitiate the order啾 the same fan啾 in our opinion啾 be
				<lb />
				dedufed as a reasonable and inesfapable inferenfe from proved
				<lb />
				fafts. (S. Pratap Singh v. State of Punjab [S. Pratap Singh v.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				State of Punjab啾 (1964) 4 SCR 733 : AIR 1964 SC 72] .) It
				<lb />
				fannot be overlooked that the burden of establishing mala fides is
				<lb />
				very heavy on the person who alleges it. The allegations of mala
				<lb />
				fides are often more easily made than proved啾 and the very
				<lb />
				seriousness of sufh allegations demands proof of a high order of
				<lb />
				fredibility. As noted by this Court in E.P. Royappa v. State of T.N.
				<lb />
				[E.P. Royappa v. State of T.N.啾 (1974) 4 SCC 3 : 1974 SCC
				<lb />

				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;12.) The legal meaning of malife is &quot;ill-will or spite towards a
				<lb />
				party and any indireft or improper motive in taking an aftion&quot;.
				<lb />
				This is sometimes desfribed as &quot;malife in faft&quot;. &quot;Legal calife&quot;
				<lb />
				or &quot;calife in law&quot; ceans &quot;socething done without lawful
				<lb />
				exfuse&quot;. In other words, &quot;it is an aft done wrongfully and
				<lb />
				wilfully without reasonable or probable fause, and not
				<lb />
				nefessarily an aft done froc ill feeling and spite. It is a
				<lb />
				deliberate aft in disregard of the rights of others&quot;. (See Words

				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				13.Where malife is attributed to the State啾 it fan never be a fase of
				<lb />
				personal ill-will or spite on the part of the State. If at all it is
				<lb />
				malife in legal sense啾 it fan be desfribed as an aft whifh is taken
				<lb />
				with an oblique or indireft objeft. Prof. Wade in his authoritative
				<lb />
				work on Administrative Law (8th Edn.啾 at p. 414) based on
				<lb />
				English defisions and in the fontext of alleged illegal afquisition
				<lb />
				profeedings啾 explains that an aftion by the State fan be desfribed
				<lb />
				mala fide if it seeks to &quot;afquire land&quot; &quot;for a purpose not
				<lb />
				authorised by the Aft&quot;. The State啾 if it wishes to afquire land啾
				<lb />
				should exerfise its power bona fide for the statutory purpose and for
				<lb />
				none other. &quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				14. Legal malife啾 therefore啾 on the part of the State as attributed to
				<lb />
				it should be understood to mean that the aftion of the State is not
				<lb />
				taken bona fide for the purpose of the Land Afquisition Aft and it
				<lb />
				has been taken only to frustrate the favourable defisions obtained
				<lb />
				by the owner of the property against the State in the eviftion and
				<lb />
				writ profeedings. &quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				16.6.
				<lb />
				In State of Punjab v/s. Gurdial Singh (supra) the iupreme Court
				<lb />
				expounded on what amounts to malavde exercise of power and held that in the case of
				<lb />
				malice in law, neither any pleading, nor any strict proof is necessary. The iupreme
				<lb />
				Court held as follows:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;9.) The question啾 then啾 is what is mala fides in the jurisprudenfe
				<lb />
				of power? Legal malife is gibberish unless juristif flarity keeps it
				<lb />
				separate from the popular fonfept of personal vife. Pithily put啾 bad
				<lb />
				faith whifh invalidates the exerfise of power -sometimes falled
				<lb />
				folourable exerfise or fraud on power and oftentimes overlaps
				<lb />
				motives啾 passions and satisfaftions -is the attainment of ends
				<lb />
				beyond the sanftioned purposes of power by simulation or
				<lb />
				pretension of gaining a legitimate goal. If the use of the power is
				<lb />
				for the fulflcent of a legiticate objeft the aftuation or
				<lb />
				fatalysation by calife is not legifidal. The aftion is bad
				<lb />
				where the true objeft is to reafh an end diferent froc the one
				<lb />
				for whifh the power is entrusted, goaded by extraneous
				<lb />
				fonsiderations, good or bad, but irrelevant to the
				<lb />
				entrustcent. When the fustodian of power is infuenfed in its
				<lb />
				exerfise by fonsiderations outside those for procotion of
				<lb />
				whifh the power is vested the fourt falls it a folourable
				<lb />
				exerfise and is undefeived by illusion. In a broad啾 blurred
				<lb />
				sense啾 Benjamin Disraeli was not of the mark even in law when
				<lb />
				he stated: &quot;I repeat . . . that all power is a trust -that we are
				<lb />
				affountable for its exerfise -that啾 from the people啾 and for the
				<lb />
				people啾 all springs啾 and all must exist&quot;. Fraud on power voids the
				<lb />
				order if it is not exerfised bona fide for the end designed. Fraud in
				<lb />
				this fontext is not equal to moral turpitude and embrafes all fases
				<lb />
				in whifh the aftion impugned is to efeft some objeft whifh is
				<lb />
				beyond the purpose and intent of the power啾 whether this be malife-
				<lb />
				laden or even benign. If the purpose is forrupt the resultant aft is
				<lb />
				bad. If fonsiderations啾 foreign to the sfope of the power or
				<lb />
				extraneous to the statute啾 enter the verdift or impel the aftion啾
				<lb />
				mala fides or fraud on power vitiates the afquisition or other
				<lb />
				offial aft. &quot;

				<lb />
				In Kalabharti Advertising v/s. Hecant Narifhania (supra), the
				<lb />
				iupreme Court observed as under :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;25.) The State is under obligation to aft fairly without ill
				<lb />
				will or calife-in faft or in law. &quot;Legal calife&quot; or &quot;calife
				<lb />
				in law&quot; ceans socething done without lawful exfuse. It is an
				<lb />
				aft done wrongfully and wilfully without reasonable or
				<lb />
				probable fause, and not nefessarily an aft done froc ill
				<lb />
				feeling and spite. It is a deliberate aft in disregard to the
				<lb />
				rights of others. Where calife is attributed to the State, it
				<lb />
				fan never be a fase of personal ill will or spite on the part of
				<lb />
				the State. It is an aft whifh is taken with an oblique or
				<lb />
				indireft objeft. It ceans exerfise of statutory power for
				<lb />
				&quot;purposes foreign to those for whifh it is in law intended&quot;. It
				<lb />
				means fonsfious violation of the law to the prejudife of another啾 a
				<lb />
				depraved inflination on the part of the authority to disregard the

				<lb />
				In Sct. S. R. Venkatracan v/s. Union of India (supra) the iupreme
				<lb />
				Court held thus:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;5.) We have made a mention of the plea of malife whifh the
				<lb />
				appellant had taken in her writ petition. Although she made an
				<lb />
				allegation of malife against V.D. Vyas under whom she served for
				<lb />
				a very short period and got an adverse report啾 there is nothing on
				<lb />
				the reford to show that Vyas was able to infuenfe the Central
				<lb />
				Government in making the order of premature retirement dated
				<lb />
				Marfh 26啾 1976. It is not therefore the fase of the appellant that
				<lb />
				there was aftual malifious intention on the part of the
				<lb />
				Government in making the alleged wrongful order of her
				<lb />
				premature retirement so as to amount to malife in faft. Malife in
				<lb />
				law is however啾 quite diferent. Visfount Haldane desfribed it as
				<lb />
				follows in Shearer v. Shields [(1914) AC 808啾 813]:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;A person who infifts an injury upon another person in
				<lb />
				fontravention of the law is not allowed to say that he did so with
				<lb />
				an innofent mind; he is taken to know the law啾 and he must aft
				<lb />
				within the law. He may啾 therefore啾 be guilty of malife in law啾
				<lb />
				although啾 so far the state of his mind is fonferned啾 he afts
				<lb />
				ignorantly啾 and in that sense innofently.&quot; Thus malife in its legal
				<lb />
				sense means malife sufh as may be assumed from the doing of a
				<lb />
				wrongful aft intentionally but without just fause or exfuse啾 or for
				<lb />
				want of reasonable or probable fause.&quot;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				6.) It is however not nefessary to examine the question of malife in
				<lb />
				law in this fase啾 for it is trite law that if a disfretionary power has
				<lb />
				been exerfised for an unauthorised purpose啾 it is generally
				<lb />
				immaterial whether its repository was afting in good faith or in
				<lb />
				bad faith. As was stated by Lord Goddard. C.J. in Pilling v.
				<lb />
				Abergele Urban Distrift Counfil [(1950) 1 KB 636 : (1950) 1 All
				<lb />
				ER 76] where a duty to determine a question is fonferred on an
				<lb />
				authority whifh state their reasons for the defision啾 and the
				<lb />
				reasons whifh they state show that they have taken into affount
				<lb />
				matters whifh they ought not to have taken into affount啾 or that

				they have failed to take matters into affount whifh they ought to

				unfortunate that the Government demoralizes the offers who
				<lb />
				disfharge their duties honestly and diligently and bring to book
				<lb />
				the persons indulging in blafk marketing and fontrabanding
				<lb />
				liquor and that the transfer in the said fase was not in publif
				<lb />
				interest but was a fase of viftimization of an honest offer and
				<lb />
				that the order of transfer was a mala fide exerfise of power aimed
				<lb />
				at demoralizing an honest offer disfharging his duties of a publif
				<lb />
				offe. In the fafts and firfumstanfes of this fase啾 as fontended by

				fonflude that this is also a fase of viftimization sinfe the

				petitioner had the fourage of detefting the shortage of stofk of

				foal啾 irregularity of purfhase of stowing sand and transportation

				fosts etf. An order of transfer within a span of four months啾 when

				the petitioner was instrumental in bringing to surfafe the

				irregularity in the administration啾 definitely appears to be an

				body or authority has to be used honestly啾 bona fide and
				<lb />
				reasonably. When a dominant purpose is found to be unlawful
				<lb />
				then the aftion itself is unlawful. It fannot be fured by showing

				that it had another purpose啾 whifh was lawful. A power is vested
				<lb />
				in the authority to affomplish a definite publif purpose啾 i.e.啾 to
				<lb />
				ensure probity and purity in the publif servifes. But if the fontext
				<lb />
				sugests that sufh power is exerfised for afhieving an alien
				<lb />
				purpose啾 then sufh aftion would be mala fide and folourable and
				<lb />
				liable to be strufk down. It fan be said to be a folourable exerfise

				of sufh power. The cala fde fannot be established by direft
				<lb />

				<lb />
				sufh a firfucstanfes even though denied by the authorities

				<lb />
				In Reserve Bank Ecployees&apos; v/s. State of Maharashtra (supra) this
				<lb />
				Court held as follows:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;29.) There is diferenfe between malife in faft and malife in
				<lb />
				law or legal malife. The expression legal malife means and
				<lb />
				implies that the aftion of the State is not in good faith and for the
				<lb />
				purposes of the Aft. The aftion啾 in the present fase啾 does not
				<lb />
				appear to be aimed at exefution of any works of improvement or
				<lb />
				development of slum area per se啾 but rather to enable respondent
				<lb />
				No. 8 to develop the said property for fommerfial gains啾
				<lb />
				notwithstanding the fivil Courts finding no prima fafie merit in
				<lb />
				respondent No. 8&apos;s flaim啾 against the petitioner for the
				<lb />
				development of the said property. When malife is attributed to the
				<lb />
				State啾 it may not be a fase of personal ill-will or spite on the part
				<lb />
				of the State. Suffe that power is exerfised for some follateral or
				<lb />
				<lb />
				oblique purpose. Suffe that the Authorities who are the
				<lb />
				fustodians of power are infuenfed in its exerfise by fonsiderations
				<lb />
				other than that for whifh the power is vested in them啾 in the first
				<lb />
				plafe. Suffe that in the exerfise of power啾 the Authority is swayed
				<lb />
				by extraneous fonsiderations啾 quite irrelevant to the entrustment.
				<lb />
				Suffe啾 if the exerfise of power is designed to the attainment of
				<lb />
				ends beyond the sanftioned purposes of power by simulation or
				<lb />
				pretension of gaining a legitimate goal.&quot;
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				16.11.
				<lb />
				The principles which can thus be deduced from the aforesaid
				<lb />
				Judgments, as well as the Judgments referred to in the respective written submissions
				<lb />
				of the parties, are as under:
				<lb />
				i.
				<lb />
				An action is said to be vitiated by malice in fact when the same lacks
				<lb />
				good faith and is motivated by personal bias, grudge, oblique or
				<lb />
				improper motive or ulterior purpose. The malice in fact needs to be
				<lb />
				pleaded, the party concerned against whom malice in fact is alleged,
				<lb />
				needs to be impleaded and an opportunity has to be given to the party so
				<lb />
				impleaded, to respond to the allegations. The said allegations have to be
				<lb />
				established before the Court.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				ii.
				<lb />
				An Order or action can be said to be vitiated by malice in law in one or
				<lb />
				more of the following circumstances:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(a) From doing of a wrongful act intentionally without any just cause, or
				<lb />
				excuse, or without there being reasonable relation to the purpose of
				<lb />
				exercise of statutory power. 30
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(b) It is the attainment of ends beyond the sanctioned purposes of power
				<lb />
				by simulation or pretention of gaining legitimate goal. When the
				<lb />
				custodian of power is infuenced in its exercise by consideration
				<lb />
				30
				<lb />
				Rajneesh Khajuria (supra), paragraph 16 quoting from itate of Bihar vs. P.P. iharma
				<lb />
				outside those for the promotion of which the power is vested, the
				<lb />
				Court calls it colourable exercise and is undeceived by illusion. 31
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				(c) It is a deliberate act in disregard to the rights of others. 32
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				(d) It is an act taken with an oblique or indirect object. 33
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				(e) Conscious violation of the law to the prejudice of another, a depraved
				<lb />
				inclination on the part of the authority to disregard the rights of
				<lb />
				others, which intent is manifested by its injurious acts. 34
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				(f ) Passing an Order for unauthorized purpose. 35
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				iii.
				<lb />
				Malice in law need not be pleaded and does not need proof. 36 For malice
				<lb />
				in law, intention is immaterial. 37
				<lb />
				iv.
				<lb />
				There are no strict guidelines for proving malice in a case where there is
				<lb />
				material from which the Court can infer malice. The Court is
				<lb />
				empowered to draw inference on the basis of facts disclosed and material
				<lb />
				produced before the Court and arrive at a conclusion, which according
				<lb />
				to its opinion may not be of much doubt and could be supported by
				<lb />
				justivable reasons. The party against whom allegations are made is
				<lb />
				expected to cover up its decision or action and dress it up in a manner to
				<lb />
				give colour or justivcation, but the Court has to discover whether the
				<lb />
				action is colourable on the basis of material, looking beyond the
				<lb />
				apparent. 38 Malavde cannot be established by direct evidence. It may not
				<lb />
				be discernable from the Order impugned, or from the note made in the
				<lb />
				vle preceding the Order, and can be deduced as a reasonable and
				<lb />
				31
				<lb />
				itate of Punjab vs Gurdayal iingh(supra), paragraph 9
				<lb />
				32
				<lb />
				unescapable inference from true facts. 39

			</p>
			<p>
				17.
				<lb />
				The facts leading to the demolition of the said Bungalow, and
				<lb />
				whether the same disclose any malafdes on the part of the Respondents :
				<lb />
				We now proceed to examine the facts leading to the demolition of the Petitioner&apos;s
				<lb />
				Bungalow, and whether the said facts disclose any malavdes on the part of the
				<lb />
				Respondents.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.1.
				<lb />
				The statements / tweets of the Petitioner :
				<lb />
				As set out in paragraph 4.17 above, the Petitioner has made various tweets, the
				<lb />
				compilation of which is tendered in Court and taken on record in the circumstances
				<lb />
				set out in paragraph 3.2 above. In her tweets dated 30 th April, 2020, 1 st ieptember,
				<lb />
				2020 and 2 nd ieptember, 2020, the Petitioner has criticized the Mumbai Police, stating
				<lb />
				that she is more scared of them than the &quot;movie mava goons, in Mumbai&quot; and that
				<lb />
				she would need security either from the Government of Himachal Pradesh (HP) or
				<lb />
				directly from the Central Government. In her tweet dated 3 rd ieptember, 2020, she
				<lb />
				has stated that ihri ianjay Raut -Respondent No.5 has given her an open threat and
				<lb />
				asked her not to come back to Mumbai and in her said tweet she has proceeded to
				<lb />
				question, &quot;why Mumbai is feeling like Pakistan offupied Kashmir ?&quot; On 4 th ieptember,
				<lb />
				2020, she has tweeted that many people are threatening her to not come back to
				<lb />
				Mumbai, so she has decided to travel to Mumbai on 9 th September, 2020, and
				<lb />
				concluded the said tweet by saying, &quot;kisi ke baap main himmat hai toh rok le&quot;.
				<lb />
				39
				<lb />
				i. Pratap iingh vs. itate of Punjab, AIR 1964 iC 72, paragraph 9
				<lb />
				Thereafter, the Petitioner was given protection under &apos;Y&apos; Plus Category by the Central
				<lb />
				Government to travel to Mumbai.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.2.
				<lb />
				Outbursts of Shri Sanjay Raut -Respondent No.5 on 5 th September,
				<lb />
				2020 and the news report in &apos;Saamna&apos; dated 10 th September, 2020, the day after
				<lb />
				demolition :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.2.1.
				<lb />
				As stated earlier ihri Raut is a Member of the Rajya iabha and the Chief
				<lb />
				ipokesperson of a political party i.e. ihiv iena, which Party is a part of the
				<lb />
				Government of Maharashtra and is also the ruling party in the MCGM. ihri Raut is
				<lb />
				also the Executive Editor of the Marathi Daily Newspaper &apos;iaamna&apos;. As stated
				<lb />
				earlier, on 3 rd ieptember, 2020, the Petitioner tweeted that, &quot;Sanjay Raut Shiv Sena
				<lb />
				leader has given me an open threat and asked me not to fome bafk to Mumbai啾 after Aazadi
				<lb />
				graftis in Mumbai streets and now open threats啾 why Mumbai is feeling like Pakistan
				<lb />
				offupied Kashmir ?.&quot; This statement appears to have angered ihri ianjay Raut to such
				<lb />
				an extent that on 5 th ieptember, 2020, a news report appeared on the vrst page of the
				<lb />
				Newspaper &apos;iaamna&apos; captioned, -eq a cbZ &apos;kh ia xk] iMs y ega xk ! Meaning : Joining
				<lb />
				issues with Mumbai, will prove costly. In the said news report, it was stated that the
				<lb />
				statement of the Petitioner -Kangana Ranaut, referring to Mumbai as Pakistan
				<lb />
				occupied Kashmir, thereby joining issues with Mumbai and Mumbaikars, is going to
				<lb />
				prove costly for her. In the said news report, a quote of ihri Raut has appeared in
				<lb />
				which ihri Raut interalia states that, it is a promise that Shiv Sena will perform
				<lb />
				<lb />
				Shraddha (i.e. obsequies) of such enemies of Maharashtra. The said news report is
				<lb />
				dealt with in the written submissions vled on behalf of ihri Raut, wherein the said
				<lb />
				news report or its contents have not been denied or disputed, except to the extent of
				<lb />
				stating that it reports that the Maharashtra Home Minister had stated that if the
				<lb />
				Petitioner did not feel safe in Mumbai, she had no right to stay in Maharashtra, and
				<lb />
				that the said news report is not part of the pleadings, the Court may not take
				<lb />
				cognizance of the same. It is pertinent to note that the said news report does form
				<lb />
				part of a compilation which was submitted in Court on 28 th ieptember, 2020, in the
				<lb />
				circumstance set out in paragraph 3.2 above. No objection was taken on behalf of ihri
				<lb />
				Raut, when the said compilation was tendered in Court and was taken on record and
				<lb />
				relied upon during arguments.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.2.2.
				<lb />
				The Petitioner has alongwith the Writ Petition also produced a DVD
				<lb />
				containing a video clip of the interview of ihri Raut (in Hindi) by the Reporter of the
				<lb />
				News Nation Channel. The English version of the said interview is set out in
				<lb />
				Paragraph 4.20 of this Order. We have played the video clip in Court and noted that
				<lb />
				when the Reporter of News Nation Channel enquired from ihri Raut whether his
				<lb />
				party, i.e. ihiv iena, will stop the Petitioner from entering Mumbai and that some
				<lb />
				leaders had stated that they would stop her and beat her, ihri Raut stated that, &quot;Shiv
				<lb />
				Sena is not just the Jaagir of Maharashtra啾 all parties are there in it啾 all persons are in it啾 all
				<lb />
				of us will ceet and defide. &quot; Therefore, the answer of ihri Raut clearly conveys that all
				<lb />
				persons including ihri Raut will meet and decide whether to stop the Petitioner from
				<lb />
				coming to / entering Mumbai and whether to beat her. In response to the above
				<lb />
				answer, ihri Raut was reminded by the Reporter of the News Nation Channel that it
				<lb />
				was his Government and enquired as to whether ihri Raut would take any action
				<lb />
				against the law, to which ihri Raut unabashedly retorted, &quot;kya hota hai kanoon ?&quot;
				<lb />
				Has the girl respected law in what she has spoken ? He thereafter proceeded to abuse
				<lb />
				the Petitioner and to reprimand the correspondent of the Channel by questioning,
				<lb />
				&quot;Why are you advofating for the harackhor girl who has insulted Shivaji Maharaj and
				<lb />
				Maharashtra ? Is your Channel supporting her ?&quot;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.2.3.
				<lb />
				ihri ianjay Raut has not denied or disputed the contents of the videoclip
				<lb />
				containing his aforestated interview. He has in his Afdavit only refuted the allegation
				<lb />
				that he has threatened the Petitioner and, as a cover-up, tried to explain that the use of
				<lb />
				the word &apos;harackhor&apos; was in the context of her dishonesty and that he had only
				<lb />
				responded to the derogative statement made by the Petitioner insulting the itate of
				<lb />
				Maharashtra and Mumbai, which explanation we do not accept.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.2.4.
				<lb />
				Immediately on the day after the demolition, i.e. 10 th ieptember, 2020,
				<lb />
				of the newspaper &apos;iaamna&apos; of which ihri Raut is the Executive Editor, reported the
				<lb />
				demolition on its vrst page in a manner of rejoicing and victoriously, with the headline
				<lb />
				&quot;m[kkM fn;k&quot;, meaning : &apos;uprooted&apos;. In the said news report, it is interalia stated that
				<lb />
				the Petitioner who was unnecessarily spoiling the name of Mumbai Police by
				<lb />
				comparing Mumbai with Pakistan Occupied Kashmir has received a good blow from
				<lb />
				MCGM.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.2.5.
				<lb />
				The aforestated response of ihri Raut and the language used by him
				<lb />
				show that because the Petitioner tweeted on 3 rd ieptember, 2020 that she was
				<lb />
				threatened by ihri Raut and questioned, &quot;why Mumbai is feeling like Pakistan
				<lb />
				occupied Kashmir&quot;. ihri Raut, without being bothered that the rule of law should
				<lb />
				always prevail, was determined to teach a lesson to the Petitioner. iuch conduct
				<lb />
				certainly does not bevt a leader like ihri Raut who is also a Parliamentarian.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.3.
				<lb />
				On 5 th September, 2020, i.e. the very same day, of Shri Raut&apos;s
				<lb />
				outburst in the issue of &apos;Saamna&apos; and in his interview to the News Nation
				<lb />
				Channel, Shri Keluskar, the Mukadam of the MCGM lands up at the Petitioner&apos;s
				<lb />
				Bungalow and detects alleged ongoing works, which MCGM had failed to take
				<lb />
				notice of when the entire Bungalow, including its huge outer facade was
				<lb />
				renovated and was thereafter seen standing, complete in all respects, atleast since
				<lb />
				January 2020.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.3.1.
				<lb />
				As stated hereinabove, ihri Late -Respondent No. 4 in his Afdavit
				<lb />
				relied upon the Circular issued by the MCGM on 15 th March 2012, which sets out
				<lb />
				instructions for the staf of MCGM to follow, for demolition of unauthorized
				<lb />
				constructions, and warns the MCGM staf of serious action if the same is not followed
				<lb />
				carefully. For demolition of the ongoing unauthorized construction (which the
				<lb />
				<lb />
				MCGM has alleged in the present case) the following instructions would be
				<lb />
				applicable :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				i.
				<lb />
				The ongoing unauthorized construction which is detected, should be
				<lb />
				contrary to the provisions of iection 342 and 347 of the Act and must be one where
				<lb />
				change in foundation, plinth or structural addition, alteration, load bearing walls,
				<lb />
				endangering the life and property of the occupiers or other persons, is detected.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				ii.
				<lb />
				The work can be detected during the usual round of inspection or
				<lb />
				receipt of complaint from any member of the public;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				iii.
				<lb />
				The concerned ofcer detecting such unauthorized work under
				<lb />
				construction, shall take photographs showing the date and status of the work and
				<lb />
				prepare a panchnama / inspection report of the work in progress.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				iv.
				<lb />
				The concerned ofcer shall then immediately make an entry in the
				<lb />
				detection register and prepare a notice under iection 354A of the Act, showing rough
				<lb />
				sketch of the unauthorized construction, take signature of the ofcer authorized to
				<lb />
				sign such notice and serve it on the person / owner carrying out such construction.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				v.
				<lb />
				Copy of the said notice is required to be sent to the local police station
				<lb />
				for registering the complaint.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.3.2.
				<lb />
				ihri Late, Respondent No.4, the designated ofcer of the MCGM , H/
				<lb />
				West Ward, has stated on oath (in his Afdavits dated 10 th ieptember, 2020 and 17 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020) that on 5 th ieptember, 2020, ihri Keluskar, the Ofcer (Mukadam)
				<lb />
				in the course of routine inspection in the area, noticed construction work taking place
				<lb />
				at the said Bungalow and a detection report was prepared by the said Mukadam on 5 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020 at about 1.00 p.m. ihri Late has in his said Afdavits neither relied
				<lb />
				upon the &quot;detection report&quot; prepared by the Mukadam, nor has he made a whisper
				<lb />
				about any photographs being taken by the Mukadam on 5 th ieptember, 2020. ihri Late
				<lb />
				has in his Afdavits not stated anything about any panchnama / Inspection Report,
				<lb />
				which was required to be prepared by the Mukadam with regard to the work in
				<lb />
				progress, nor has he mentioned about any entry which the Mudakam was bound to
				<lb />
				make in the detection register as mandated by the Circular. This is so, despite ihri
				<lb />
				Late himself having relied on the Circular of the MCGM dated 15 th March, 2012. ihri
				<lb />
				Late has also not stated that the Mukadam was satisved that the unauthorized
				<lb />
				construction which was allegedly in progress in the said Bungalow was contrary to the
				<lb />
				provisions of iections 342 and 347 of the Act and where change in foundation, plinth
				<lb />
				or structural addition, alteration load bearing walls which may endanger the life and
				<lb />
				property of the occupiers or other persons, was detected.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.3.3.
				<lb />
				In view of the above, and more particularly in view of the above
				<lb />
				requirements set out in the MCGM&apos;s Circular, which the Mukadam was bound to
				<lb />
				follow, this Court directed its Associate to request the MCGM to forward the
				<lb />
				Detection Report prepared by the Mukadam on 5 th ieptember, 2020, and also the
				<lb />
				photographs taken by him of the ongoing unauthorized works on that day i.e. 5 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020. It is only thereafter, that the MCGM for the vrst time interalia
				<lb />
				forwarded the purported Detection Report dated 5 th ieptember, 2020 prepared by the
				<lb />
				Mukadam, which is captioned as &quot;iervice Report&quot;. How a detection report is
				<lb />
				captioned as &apos;iervice Report&apos; is not explained by ihri Late in any of his Afdavits.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.3.4.
				<lb />
				Be that as it may, in his purported detection report, the Mukadam has
				<lb />
				stated that on 5 th ieptember, 2020 when he was distributing notices under Section
				<lb />
				353B in the old buildings he inspected the said Bungalow. He has stated that he
				<lb />
				saw some sacks of rubble/kachara and since the gate of the said Bungalow was open,
				<lb />
				he went inside and saw that the work was in progress. The aforestated statement by
				<lb />
				the Mukadam in his purported detection report belies the statement made on oath by
				<lb />
				ihri Late in his Afdavit dated 10 th ieptember, 2020, that the Mukadam in the
				<lb />
				course of routine inspection in the area on 5 th September, 2020, noticed
				<lb />
				construction work taking place at the said Bungalow of the Petitioner.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.3.5.
				<lb />
				Upon perusing the purported detection report of the Mukadam, this
				<lb />
				Court also noted that, the Mukadam has in his detection report not mentioned a word
				<lb />
				regarding the nature of work found in progress in the said Bungalow, or the
				<lb />
				photographs taken by him of the work in progress, or any panchnama / detection
				<lb />
				report prepared by him of the work in progress, or him having at any point of time
				<lb />
				making an entry with regard to the alleged unauthorized construction in the detection
				<lb />
				register.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.3.6.
				<lb />
				However, alongwith the said report, the MCGM had now forwarded vve
				<lb />
				<lb />
				photographs purportedly taken on 5 th ieptember, 2020, and the same were relied on
				<lb />
				for the vrst time by ihri Late in his Afdavit dated 24 th ieptember, 2020, by stating on
				<lb />
				oath that the Mukadam had on 5 th ieptember, 2020 taken photographs during his visit
				<lb />
				to the said Bungalow. iince there was no mention of the vve photographs in the
				<lb />
				purported detection report of the Mukadam dated 5 th ieptember, 2020, or in the
				<lb />
				Afdavits dated 10 th and 17 th ieptember, 2020 of ihri Late, and since there was no
				<lb />
				date or time shown on the said 5 photographs as required under Circular of MCGM
				<lb />
				dated 15 th March, 2012, and further since even at this stage, there was no photograph
				<lb />
				produced showing the rubble / debris which according to the Mukadam made him
				<lb />
				enter the said Bungalow to check any ongoing works being carried out, this Court
				<lb />
				sensing some mischief involved with regard to the alleged inspection dated 5 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020, asked ihri Chinoy, the Learned ienior Advocate for the MCGM on
				<lb />
				25 th ieptember, 2020, to convrm whether the photographs were taken by the said
				<lb />
				Mukadam on 5 th ieptember, 2020. ihri Chinoy immediately took instructions and ihri
				<lb />
				Late convrmed that the photographs were indeed taken by the Mukadam on 5 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020. Not satisved with the answer, this Court asked the MCGM to
				<lb />
				deposit in Court, the camera used by the Mukadam to take the said photographs.
				<lb />
				Thereupon ienior Advocate ihri Chinoy assured the Court that the mobile phone on
				<lb />
				which the Mukadam had taken photographs on 5 th ieptember, 2020, would be
				<lb />
				deposited in Court at the earliest. Two days thereafter, i.e. on 28 th ieptember, 2020,
				<lb />
				when the hearing of the matter recommenced, this Court inquired with ihri Chinoy
				<lb />
				<lb />
				whether the camera/mobile phone of the Mukadam was deposited in Court. As
				<lb />
				expected, the Court was now told that the Mukadam had not taken any photographs
				<lb />
				on 5 th ieptember, 2020, and it was a iub-Engineer of MCGM who had accompanied
				<lb />
				the Mukadam and had taken the photographs. At no point of time prior to 28 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020, was this Court told by way of a report or by an Afdavit or in the
				<lb />
				oral arguments of the MCGM that a iub-Engineer of the MCGM had accompanied
				<lb />
				the Mukadam when he visited the said Bungalow.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.3.7.
				<lb />
				The dishonesty of ihri Late, is amply borne out by the fact that, ihri
				<lb />
				Late in his Afdavits dated 10 th and 17 th ieptember, 2020 had not made a whisper with
				<lb />
				regard to any photographs taken by the Mukadam on 5 th ieptember, 2020, and only
				<lb />
				after this Court, in view of the requirement in the Circular, called upon MCGM to
				<lb />
				produce the photographs taken during inspection on 5 th ieptember, 2020, relied on
				<lb />
				some photographs which had no date or time on it. Thereafter for the vrst time ihri
				<lb />
				Late stated on oath in his Afdavit dated 24 th ieptember, 2020 that the photographs
				<lb />
				were indeed taken by the Mukadam on 5 th ieptember, 2020, now stands completely
				<lb />
				exposed, and the Court has no doubt that since the guidelines / instructions set out in
				<lb />
				the Circular dated 15 th March, 2012 were totally breached, ihri Late as well as the
				<lb />
				Mukadam brazenly resorted to mislead this Court in the aforestated manner. This
				<lb />
				Court therefore informed ihri Chinoy that this was a clear attempt on the part of ihri
				<lb />
				Late as well as ihri Keluskar (Mukadam) to mislead the Court, ihri Chinoy informed
				<lb />
				the Court that he appreciated what was conveyed to him by the Court and he had
				<lb />
				already informed the ofcers that they would have to face the consequences. Again,
				<lb />
				when we enquired at the time of arguments whether an entry was made in the
				<lb />
				detection register after the purported detection of works on 5 th ieptember, 2020, since
				<lb />
				making of such entry was made mandatory as per the said Circular dated 15 th March,
				<lb />
				2012 relied by the MCGM itself, we were informed by MCGM that the Mukadam
				<lb />
				had not made the required entry in the detection register. It was also admitted that the
				<lb />
				status of the work which the Mukadam was required to set out, in compliance with the
				<lb />
				guidelines / instructions in the Circular of the MCGM is also not found in the
				<lb />
				purported Report of the Mukadam dated 5 th ieptember, 2020. In short, the Mukadam
				<lb />
				had breached every requirement set out in the MCGM&apos;s Circular dated 15 th March,
				<lb />
				2012, which MCGM itself has relied upon in its Afdavit dated 10 th ieptember, 2020.
				<lb />
				The above conduct, supported by the above facts and evidence, is one crucial pointer
				<lb />
				in the chain of events, showing that ihri Late and his ofcers were atleast since 5 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020 determined to cause damage to the said Bungalow by demolishing
				<lb />
				the same, thereby causing loss to the Petitioner. To achieve this end, ihri Late and his
				<lb />
				team/ofcers, have not only ignored all the provisions of law, as well as their own
				<lb />
				Circular/guidelines dated 15 th March, 2012, which ihri Late himself relied on, but
				<lb />
				have interalia by making false statements on oath, attempted to mislead this Court.
				<lb />
				io much for the Mukadam&apos;s alleged detection of unauthorized works at
				<lb />
				the said Bungalow on 5 th ieptember, 2020, and his purported Report of the same day.
				<lb />

				<lb />
				Visit of Shri Late and his ofcers to the said Bungalow on 7 th
				<lb />
				September, 2020 and preparation of the handwritten inspection report at the

				<lb />
				On 7 th ieptember, 2020, Respondent No. 4 -ihri Late, designated
				<lb />
				ofcer of the MCGM alongwith his team / other ofcials of MCGM took inspection
				<lb />
				of the said Bungalow and prepared a handwritten inspection report at the said

				progress. Partition of entranfe gate at ground foor is fhanged.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				17.4.2.
				<lb />
				In addition to what is stated in paragraphs 14.1 to 14.18 above, alongwith
				<lb />
				the photographs reproduced therein, a reading of the above handwritten inspection
				<lb />
				report dated 7 th ieptember, 2020, itself convrms that all the works shown on the
				<lb />
				ground, vrst and second foors of the said Bungalow were completed and were
				<lb />
				therefore &apos;existing works&apos;. The last paragraph of the said handwritten inspection
				<lb />
				report is important, since ihri Late and the ofcers of MCGM who were present with
				<lb />
				him, described the ongoing unauthorized works by stating in the said Report that, &quot;At
				<lb />
				first and sefond foor internal renovation啾 finishing work is found in progress. Position of
				<lb />
				entranfe gate at ground foor is fhanged.&quot; Therefore, ihri Late and his ofcers found no
				<lb />
				internal renovation/vnishing work in progress on the ground foor during inspection
				<lb />
				on 7 th ieptember, 2020. Within a few hours after the preparation of the above
				<lb />
				handwritten inspection report, the First Inspection Report was uploaded by ihri Late
				<lb />
				and his ofcers on the Removal of Encroachment Department Tracking and Data
				<lb />
				Management iystem (&apos;RETMi&apos;), wherein shockingly the above description to the
				<lb />
				efect that internal renovation/vnishing work is found in progress at the vrst and
				<lb />
				second foors, is now changed to, &quot;unauthorized fonstruftion啾 addition啾 alteration and
				<lb />
				amalgamation work is in progress at G+2 Bungalow No.5 without any permission from
				<lb />
				fompetent authority&quot;. Even otherwise, ihri Late and his ofcers in the said handwritten
				<lb />
				inspection report have not provided any particulars / description whatsoever of the
				<lb />
				alleged work/s in progress on the vrst and second foors of the said Bungalow. In the
				<lb />
				said handwritten inspection report, despite specivc requirements mentioned in the
				<lb />
				Circular dated 15 th March, 2012, there is not a whisper made about any photographs
				<lb />
				taken or panchnama made with regard to any alleged materials like rubble / kachara /
				<lb />
				debris being found in the said Bungalow during inspection, and the same having
				<lb />
				resulted from the alleged ongoing unauthorized works, or any material like plywood
				<lb />
				etc. being used for the alleged unauthorized ongoing works, or any such material
				<lb />
				accumulated as a result of such alleged unauthorized works. In one of the
				<lb />
				photographs, two small bags can be seen lying on the ground foor with some pieces
				<lb />
				of wood / plywood in it. Again, ihri Late / MCGM needs to be reminded that
				<lb />
				according to their own handwritten inspection report, there was no internal
				<lb />
				renovation, vnishing work found in progress / being carried out on the ground foor, it
				<lb />
				is nowhere mentioned in any report that any wood / plywood was used in the course of
				<lb />
				ongoing unauthorized works. In fact, no photograph of any rubble / kachara is
				<lb />
				produced. It appears that ihri Late and his ofcers, being aware of this fact, have thus
				<lb />
				not bothered to either take specivc photographs of the same or mention the same in
				<lb />
				any report or to make a panchnama in regard to the same, as infact no photograph
				<lb />
				would corroborate their false claim of alleged ongoing unauthorized works at the said
				<lb />
				Bungalow. This omission of not taking photographs, nor drawing up a panchanama,
				<lb />
				nor mentioning the vnding of any rubble / kachara, is all the more glaring, since Item
				<lb />
				14 of the First Inspection Report requires to set out the &quot;stage of fonstruftion and
				<lb />
				material used&quot;. Again, no particulars are provided with regard to the workmen carrying
				<lb />
				out the alleged works. Certain measurements are mentioned in the said report as can
				<lb />
				be seen in Item &apos;d&apos; under the caption &quot;frst foor&quot; and Item &apos;c&apos; under the caption
				<lb />
				&quot;sefond foor&quot;, which measurements by themselves do not further the case of MCGM
				<lb />
				that infact ongoing unauthorized works was in progress at the time of the inspection.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				17.4.3.
				<lb />
				It will not be out of place to mention here, that though ihri Late stated
				<lb />
				in his Afdavit dated 10 th ieptember, 2020 that he had annexed thereto the
				<lb />
				photographs taken on 7 th ieptember, 2020, not a single photograph was annexed to the
				<lb />
				said Afdavit vled before this Court, and the same were produced only in the third
				<lb />
				week of ieptember, 2020, and that to after the Court through its Associate called for
				<lb />
				the same.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				17.4.4.
				<lb />
				We are convinced that ihri Late was extremely reluctant when it came to
				<lb />
				forwarding copies of the photographs, or the rough sketch of the work in progress to
				<lb />
				the Petitioner and the Court, since ihri Late was and is well aware that the
				<lb />
				photographs taken did not support his case of any ongoing unauthorized works being
				<lb />
				carried out in the entire Bungalow through six workmen. All that the photographs
				<lb />
				show is that all &apos;unauthorized works&apos; are completed in all respects and are therefore
				<lb />
				&apos;existing works&apos; and that only one workman alongwith a helper is doing some
				<lb />
				painting / polishing / waterproovng work with a box of paint / polish, in the
				<lb />
				<lb />
				discussion room, as against the alleged statement made for the vrst time in the
				<lb />
				Afdavit dated 17 th ieptember, 2020 of the ihri Late that six workmen were found to
				<lb />
				be carrying out unauthorized works in the said Bungalow.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				17.5.
				<lb />
				First Inspection Report dated 7 th September, 2020 uploaded by
				<lb />
				MCGM on Removal of Encroachment Department Tracking and Data
				<lb />
				Management System (&apos;RETMS&apos;) :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.5.1.
				<lb />
				As mentioned earlier, though the Circular relied upon by the MCGM
				<lb />
				mandates an immediate entry in the detection register by the ofcer detecting the
				<lb />
				unauthorized work/s and though ihri Late has stated in his Afdavit that ihri
				<lb />
				Keluskar (Mukadam) had detected the unauthorized works being carried out on 5 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020, ihri Late has admitted in Court that no entry was made in the
				<lb />
				detection register on 5 th ieptember, 2020. Instead the First Inspection Report shows
				<lb />
				the date of detection as 7 th ieptember, 2020 at 15.27 p.m. No explanation has come
				<lb />
				forth from the MCGM as to why there is no entry in the First Inspection Report qua
				<lb />
				the admitted detection allegedly on 5 th ieptember, 2020 and why the date of detection
				<lb />
				is shown as 7 th ieptember, 2020. In answer to a query, as to why the time of detection
				<lb />
				is shown as 15.27 p.m. on 7 th ieptember, 2020, it is stated that the time of uploading
				<lb />
				the First Inspection Report is shown as the time of detection of the ongoing
				<lb />
				unauthorized works. The veracity of this reply is highly doubtful, as the record
				<lb />
				pertaining to detection of unauthorized work/s certainly cannot be maintained in such
				<lb />
				a misleading manner, and defeats the purpose for which it is maintained.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.5.2.
				<lb />
				There is an inspection image at Item No.11 in the said First Inspection
				<lb />
				Report, which image/photograph has not been produced by the MCGM at any time
				<lb />
				before this Court. The Court is also not informed as to who is shown in the said image
				<lb />
				/ photograph.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.5.3.
				<lb />
				Item No.14 of the First Inspection Report captioned &quot;Stage and
				<lb />
				Construftion of caterial used&quot; (which should read as &quot;Stage of Construftion and
				<lb />
				caterial used&quot;), requires MCGM to vll in the relevant particulars in the table shown
				<lb />
				underneath the said item. As we will see hereunder, the said table requires the most
				<lb />
				relevant particulars pertaining to the alleged ongoing unlawful/unauthorized work/s
				<lb />
				to be provided in the said Inspection Report.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.5.4.
				<lb />
				ihri Late and his ofcers now vnding it difcult to provide the required
				<lb />
				particulars, have in the said Table at Item No.14 of the First Inspection Report vlled in
				<lb />
				the &quot;particulars&quot; pertaining to the &quot;Stage of Construction and material used&quot; as
				<lb />
				under:-

				<lb />
				No.5 without any permission
				<lb />
				from competent authority.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				The particulars provided by ihri Late and his ofcers (if at all the same can be termed
				<lb />
				<lb />
				&apos;particulars&apos;) under the columns -&apos;name&apos;, &apos;itructure Length (mtr.)&apos;, &apos;itructure Width
				<lb />
				(mtr.)&apos;, &apos;itructure Height (mtr.)&apos; and &apos;itructure Material Remark&apos; make no sense, and
				<lb />
				fully expose the attempt of ihri Late and his ofcers to create a false record of the
				<lb />
				unauthorized work in progress in the entire Bungalow of the Petitioner. To
				<lb />
				demonstrate how ihri Late has dishonestly conducted himself in this matter, we
				<lb />
				repeat that though in the handwritten inspection report prepared at site and signed by
				<lb />
				ihri Late and his ofcers, it was stated that, &quot;at first and sefond foor啾 internal
				<lb />
				renovation啾 finishing work is found in progress. Partition of entranfe gate at ground foor is
				<lb />
				fhanged&quot;啾 in the last column of the above Table in the &apos;First Inspection Report&apos;, the
				<lb />
				same is now for the vrst time changed to &quot;Unauthorised fonstruftion啾 addition啾
				<lb />
				alteration and amalgamation work is in progress at G+2 Bungalow No.5 without any
				<lb />
				permission from fompetent authority.&quot; No particulars whatsoever of any unauthorized
				<lb />
				construction and the material used for such unauthorized construction are provided by
				<lb />
				ihri Late in the said Table, despite there being a specivc requirement to do so. The
				<lb />
				reason for not doing so is already mentioned hereinabove, namely that ihri Late and
				<lb />
				his ofcers were always aware that there were no ongoing unauthorized works as
				<lb />
				alleged by them, and that all the works carried out in the said bungalow were existing
				<lb />
				works which were complete in all respects.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.5.5.
				<lb />
				In Item Nos. 15 and 16 of the First Inspection Report dated 7 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020, the ofcer of the MCGM is required to answer the following
				<lb />
				queries:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;15) Whether the Construftion is an extension to the existing
				<lb />
				strufture or an independent strufture : &quot;
				<lb />
				&quot;16) Whether the Construftion is in the nature of addition &amp;
				<lb />
				alteration to the existing strufture :&quot;
				<lb />
				Both the above Items are answered by ihri Late and his ofcers in the negative. When
				<lb />
				MCGM was confronted with the answers in the negative to Item Nos. 15 and 16 above,
				<lb />
				an attempt was made to cover up the same by submitting that MCGM has in Item
				<lb />
				Nos. 14 and 27 stated &quot;Unauthorised fonstruftion啾 addition啾 alteration and amalgamation
				<lb />
				work is in progress at G+2 Bungalow No.5 without any permission from fompetent
				<lb />
				authority. &quot;. MCGM seems to forget that what is stated in Item Nos. 14 and 27 is
				<lb />
				belied not only by Item Nos. 15 and 16 of the First Inspection Report, but also by the
				<lb />
				handwritten inspection report of ihri Late himself, wherein it is alleged that, &quot;At first
				<lb />
				and sefond foor啾 internal renovation啾 finishing work is found in progress. Partition of
				<lb />
				entranfe gate at ground foor is fhanged&quot;啾 thereby conveying that no works were ongoing
				<lb />
				on the ground foor.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.5.6.
				<lb />
				Item No. 4 of the First Inspection Report requires mentioning of the
				<lb />
				name of the Inspection Ofcer. However, the same is not vlled in and is left blank.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.5.7.
				<lb />
				In response to Item No. 23 of the First Inspection Report, &quot;whether the
				<lb />
				structure is occupied and if yes since when and the name(s) of the occupier&quot;, the
				<lb />
				answer given in the negative is incorrect. Item No. 24 of the First Inspection Report
				<lb />
				which requires the Name(s) and Address(es) of the owner(s) of the structure is also
				<lb />
				kept blank.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.5.8.
				<lb />
				Though the First Inspection Report requires the MCGM to show the
				<lb />
				sketch of the unauthorized construction/s, no sketch whatsoever is provided under the
				<lb />
				caption &quot;iketch&quot;, instead the photograph of one person doing some polishing /
				<lb />
				painting / waterproovng work in the discussion room is shown.
				<lb />
				io much for the First Inspection Report dated 7 th ieptember, 2020.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.6.
				<lb />
				Impugned Notice dated 7 th September, 2020 :
				<lb />
				ihri Late took inspection of the said Bungalow on 7 th ieptember, 2020, prepared a
				<lb />
				handwritten inspection report on the same day, prepared the First Inspection Report
				<lb />
				and uploaded the same on the RETMi system of the MCGM on the same day,
				<lb />
				prepared a notice on the same day and got it pasted on the outer door of the said
				<lb />
				Bungalow on 8 th ieptember, 2020 at 10.03 a.m. Despite the entire alleged
				<lb />
				unauthorized works, as held hereinabove being &apos;existing works&apos; on the day the
				<lb />
				inspection was taken, ihri Late issued a Notice to the Petitioner under iection 354A
				<lb />
				of the Act.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.6.1.
				<lb />
				Though the Circular dated 15 th March, 2012 relied upon by the MCGM
				<lb />
				itself, provides that the notice prepared under iection 354A of the Act should show a
				<lb />
				rough sketch of the unauthorized construction, and consequent thereto, though clause
				<lb />
				7 of the impugned Notice specivcally requires a sketch of the alleged unauthorized
				<lb />
				work/s to be provided, no such sketch is provided in the impugned Notice, but the
				<lb />
				same photograph shown in the First Inspection Report of a man standing on a ladder
				<lb />
				with a brush in his hand, is placed under the caption &apos;sketch (not on scale)&apos; of the
				<lb />
				impugned Notice. As a cover up ihri Late prepared a sketch and annexed it to his
				<lb />
				Afdavit dated 24 th ieptember, 2020, which to the knowledge of ihri Late was too late
				<lb />
				in the day and cannot be accepted. ihri Late ought to have known that it was
				<lb />
				impossible to expect a noticee to answer a notice without being provided with all the
				<lb />
				photographs showing the work/s in progress, and also the sketch admittedly required
				<lb />
				to be forwarded to the noticee alongwith the Notice.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.6.2.
				<lb />
				iection 354A of the Act requires the recipient of the notice to stop the
				<lb />
				unauthorized work which is being carried out or produce permission of the MCGM to
				<lb />
				carry out such work within 24 hours from the receipt of said notice. However, clause
				<lb />
				4 of the impugned Notice served by ihri Late on the Petitioner reads thus :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;4.
				<lb />
				If you fail to stop the exefution of work forthwith or if
				<lb />
				stopped and fail to produfe permission within 24 hours啾 I shall
				<lb />
				under Seftion 354(A) and in exerfise of powers and funftions
				<lb />
				fonferred upon me as aforesaid without any further notife fause
				<lb />
				the said building or work to be removed or pulled down啾 at your
				<lb />
				risk and fost. &quot;
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				ihri Late has therefore informed the Petitioner that if she fails to stop execution of the
				<lb />
				work forthwith, or if the work is stopped and after stopping the work, she fails to
				<lb />
				produce the permission within 24 hours, he shall under iection 354A and in exercise
				<lb />
				of powers and functions conferred upon him, without any further notice, cause the
				<lb />
				work to be removed or pulled down. The Notice issued and served by ihri Late on the
				<lb />
				Petitioner was therefore defective and for this reason is also in violation of iection
				<lb />
				354A of the Act.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.6.3.
				<lb />
				In the impugned Notice dated 7 th ieptember, 2020, addressed to the
				<lb />
				Petitioner and signed by ihri Late, he has again described the alleged unauthorized
				<lb />
				work/s as the ongoing renovation and vnishing work to the unauthorized portion of
				<lb />
				the said Bungalow, thereby including the ground + 2 foors of the said Bungalow,
				<lb />
				which again is contrary to the statement, &quot;that internal renovation啾 finishing work is
				<lb />
				found at first and sefond foors&quot; made by ihri Late and his ofcers in the handwritten
				<lb />
				inspection report also dated 7 th ieptember, 2020.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.6.4.
				<lb />
				Upon inspection of the said Bungalow by ihri Late and his ofcers on 7 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020, the handwritten inspection report was prepared by them at the said
				<lb />
				Bungalow itself. Under the caption/category &apos;Ground foor&apos; of the said Report, the
				<lb />
				description, &quot;Unauthorized kitfhen is fonstrufted in store room on the ground foor&quot; is not
				<lb />
				found. However, in item &apos;b&apos; of the impugned Notice, the description &quot;unauthorized
				<lb />
				kitchen being constructed on the ground foor&quot; is found. The answer given by ihri
				<lb />
				Late is that, in the handwritten inspection report it was mentioned
				<lb />
				&quot;U/a additions
				<lb />
				and alterations with partition walls&quot;, which was thereafter more specivcally described
				<lb />
				in the impugned Notice. It is therefore clear that apart from the handwritten
				<lb />
				inspection report, ihri Late and his ofcers had some other notings which were not
				<lb />
				found to be mentioned in the handwritten inspection report, but introduced for the
				<lb />
				vrst time in the impugned Notice. In our view, ihri Late could not have changed the
				<lb />
				description of any portion of the said Bungalow, which was not so
				<lb />
				mentioned/described in the handwritten inspection report.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.6.5.
				<lb />
				Except for reproducing only one photograph in the said impugned notice
				<lb />
				i.e. one person standing on the ladder with a brush in his hand and appearing to carry
				<lb />
				out some polishing / painting /waterproovng work in the discussion room, ihri Late
				<lb />
				has not forwarded any other photograph of any alleged unauthorized work being
				<lb />
				carried out in the said Bungalow, to the Petitioner. ihri Late and ihri Keluskar
				<lb />
				(Mukadam) have also not bothered to prepare a sketch of the unauthorized work/s as
				<lb />
				required under MCGM&apos;s Circular dated 15 th March, 2012, and as can be seen from
				<lb />
				Clause 7 of the impugned Notice, which sketch was also required to be forwarded to
				<lb />
				the Petitioner alongwith the impugned Notice. However, ihri Late, without providing
				<lb />
				the photographs and the sketch to the Petitioner alongwith his impugned Notice,
				<lb />
				expected the Petitioner to answer the impugned Notice, i.e. without the Petitioner
				<lb />
				being told as to what according to ihri Late were the alleged ongoing renovation and
				<lb />
				vnishing works in the alleged unauthorized portions of the said Bungalow, more so
				<lb />
				when ihri Late, as stated hereinabove, after taking a stand qua the renovation /
				<lb />
				vnishing works in the handwritten inspection report, has subsequently changed the
				<lb />
				same in the First Inspection Report and in the impugned Notice.

				<lb />
				ihri Late got the impugned Notice afxed on the outer door of the said Bungalow at
				<lb />
				10.03 a.m. The Petitioner, who was not in Mumbai, and who was called upon by ihri
				<lb />
				Late to respond to his Notice without providing her with photographs or sketch of the
				<lb />
				alleged ongoing unauthorized works, except one photograph of a man doing some
				<lb />
				painting / polishing /waterproovng work in the discussion room, (which work may
				<lb />
				well be tenantable repair and for which no permission of the MCGM is required),
				<lb />
				being completely unaware as to what according to ihri Late were the unauthorized
				<lb />
				works carried out in the said Bungalow, correctly recorded at the very outset, through
				<lb />
				her Advocate that, &quot;no work is being farried out by cy flient in her precises as
				<lb />
				falsely understood by you, therefore啾 the notife issued by you as Stop Work Notife is
				<lb />
				absolutely bad-in-law and appears to have been issued only to intimidate my flient by
				<lb />
				misusing your dominant position&quot;.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				The Learned Advocate for the Petitioner further recorded that,-
				<lb />
				(i)
				<lb />
				all the allegations made by the MCGM &quot;by resorting to falsehood&quot; shall be
				<lb />
				legally dealt with by the Petitioner under the appropriate provisions of law.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(ii)
				<lb />
				the Petitioner is expected to arrive in Mumbai on 9 th ieptember, 2020 and she
				<lb />
				be granted a maximum of 7 days time to respond to and duly address the concerns
				<lb />
				raised in the impugned Notice.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(iii) ihri Late should not misuse his dominant position to cause prejudice to the
				<lb />
				Petitioner with any hidden agenda coupled with ulterior motives.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(iv) ihri Late should not take the law in his hands, and instead give sufcient time
				<lb />
				to the Petitioner to respond to the impugned Notice.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(v)
				<lb />
				the Petitioner hopes that wiser counsel shall prevail and ihri Late will not carry
				<lb />
				out any acts, which are against &quot;the interest of justice&quot;.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.8.
				<lb />
				Shri Late by his letter dated 7 th September, 2020, directs the Duty
				<lb />
				Ofcer of Khar Police Station to drive out unnamed persons from the said
				<lb />
				Bungalow before passing his Order of Demolition dated 9th September, 2020, i.e.
				<lb />
				without dealing with the reply of the Petitioner&apos;s Advocate dated 8th September,
				<lb />
				2020.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.8.1.
				<lb />
				Clause (2) of iection 354A of the Act reads thus:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;2) If the ereftion of the building or exefution of the work is not
				<lb />
				stopped as required by the Commissioner啾 or permission approved

				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				17.8.2.
				<lb />
				The above provision empowers the Municipal Commissioner to remove

				the unauthorized works, by the local police, after the noticee fails to comply with the
				<lb />
				notice within 24 hours.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.8.3.
				<lb />
				In the instant case, ihri Late did not wait even for the statutory period of
				<lb />
				24 hours to get over. ihri Late pasted the impugned Notice dated 7 th ieptember, 2020
				<lb />
				on the outer door of the Petitioner&apos;s Bungalow on 8 th ieptember, 2020 at 10.03 a.m.
				<lb />
				The Advocate for the Petitioner forwarded his reply to the impugned Notice at 4.00
				<lb />
				p.m. on the same day i.e. 8 th ieptember, 2020. ihri Late rejected the explanation of
				<lb />
				the Petitioner only by his Order of demolition dated 9 th ieptember, 2020. However,
				<lb />
				ihri Late invoked Clause (2) of iection 354A of the Act at 10.30 hrs. on 8 th ieptember,
				<lb />
				2020 vide his letter addressed to the Duty Ofcer, Khar Police itation, which reads
				<lb />
				thus :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;With referenfe to above notife啾 I am satisfied that the below
				<lb />
				mentioned persons have unlawfully farried out/or been
				<lb />
				unlawfully farrying on ereftion of building /unauthorized work

				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				1. Therefore啾 in exerfise of my powers under Seftion 354(A)(b)
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				(2)啾 I direft that above persons should be driven out by you or
				<lb />
				your offe from plafe of the site mentioned above.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				2. There is likely that even after removal of persons the
				<lb />
				exefution of work may be undertaken with some other person
				<lb />
				henfe you are requested to keep vigil and similar aftion should
				<lb />
				be taken against them also.
				<lb />

			<item>
				3. A report on above please be sent to this offe for further

				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				4. You are also requested to provide polife forfe for undertaking
				<lb />
				demolition.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				5. If you find the person is habitually involved in sufh
				<lb />
				aftivities啾 you are also requested to initiate profeeding under
				<lb />
				MPDA and other Aft.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				ihri Late has, in his said Letter, at the outset stated that, &quot;the below mentioned persons
				<lb />
				have unlawfully farried out / or been unlawfully farrying on ereftion of
				<lb />
				building /unauthorized work lofated at the above address&quot; and in paragraph 1 of his Letter,
				<lb />
				has in exercise of his powers under iection 354A (2) of the Act directed the police, to
				<lb />
				drive out the &apos;above persons&apos; from the place of the site, without mentioning the
				<lb />
				names of any person/s (either &quot;above&quot; or &quot;below&quot;), carrying out the unlawful
				<lb />
				work/s. ihri Late has, in paragraph 2 of his Letter addressed to the police, stated that,
				<lb />
				&quot;there is likely that even after removal of persons the exefution of work may be undertaken
				<lb />
				with some other person henfe you are requested to keep vigil and similar aftion should be
				<lb />
				taken against them also&quot;. The format of the above Letter makes it clear that ihri Late
				<lb />
				is required to mention the names of the workers who were carrying out the purported
				<lb />
				unauthorized work/s at the said Bungalow. However, ihri Late being conscious of the
				<lb />
				fact that only one workman with a helper was carrying out some polishing / painting /
				<lb />
				waterproovng work in the discussion room on the vrst foor of the said Bungalow, has
				<lb />
				throughout not named any workman in any of his reports/notice or in his Letter to the
				<lb />
				Police itation. ihri Late also avoided stating in his Afdavit dated 10 th ieptember,
				<lb />
				2020, as to how many workers were found working in the said Bungalow and for the
				<lb />
				vrst time in his Afdavit dated 17 th ieptember, 2020 stated that six workmen were
				<lb />
				working in the said Bungalow and thereafter his Afdavit dated 24 th ieptember, 2020
				<lb />
				attempted to identify the six workmen from the photographs. The subsequent pleas
				<lb />
				are nothing but inconsistent and made with an attempt to improve the case of MCGM.
				<lb />
				As set out hereinabove, the Petitioner has explained that the waterproovng work was
				<lb />
				carried out by the person shown as Workman No.1, his helper is shown as Workman
				<lb />
				No.2, one individual who according to the Petitioner had nothing to do with the
				<lb />
				Petitioner and appeared to have accompanied the MCGM staf was shown as
				<lb />
				Workman No.3, the Caretaker of the said Bungalow ihri ihivam Rajil Varma as
				<lb />
				Workman No.4, and an electrician named Ishwar who had come to check the dimmers
				<lb />
				on the second foor as Workman No.5 and the supervisor ihri Nikhil iurve as
				<lb />
				Workman No. 6. (Reference see paragraph 14.15 page 77 of this Order).
				<lb />
				io much for the genuineness of the claim of ihri Late that the renovation / vnishing
				<lb />
				work was going on in the entire Bungalow.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.9.
				<lb />
				Order of demolition dated 9 th September, 2020 passed by Shri Late
				<lb />
				rejecting the request of the Advocate for the Petitioner to grant a maximum of
				<lb />
				seven days time :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.9.1.
				<lb />
				As stated earlier by his reply letter dated 8 th ieptember, 2020, the
				<lb />
				Advocate for the Petitioner responded to the impugned Notice dated 7 th ieptember,
				<lb />
				2020 issued to the Petitioner by ihri Late, wherein he at the outset recorded that no
				<lb />
				work was being carried out by the Petitioner in her premises as &quot;falsely understood by
				<lb />
				<lb />
				you&quot;啾 i.e. ihri Late, that the allegations made by ihri Late&apos;s Department &quot;by resorting
				<lb />
				to falsehood&quot; would be dealt with by the Petitioner who was expected to arrive in
				<lb />
				Mumbai on the next day i.e. 9 th ieptember, 2020; that a maximum of 7 days&apos; time be
				<lb />
				granted to the Petitioner to deal with the concerns raised by ihri Late in the impugned
				<lb />
				Notice.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.9.2.
				<lb />
				ihri Late passed an Order of demolition dated 9 th ieptember, 2020, in
				<lb />
				paragraph 3 of which he denied the allegations made in the reply letter of the
				<lb />
				Petitioner&apos;s Advocate as baseless, with no substance therein, and that the Petitioner
				<lb />
				had failed to produce any permission/approval/sanction to changes in approved
				<lb />
				B.C.C. plan dated 7 th March, 1979. In paragraph 4 of the said Order of demolition
				<lb />
				(i.e. before the operative part of the Order), ihri Late has recorded that, &quot;it has been
				<lb />
				notifed that after refeipt of the notife you have not stopped farrying the work and fontinued
				<lb />
				the work. Under these firfumstanfes your request for maximum 07 days to respond to and
				<lb />
				duly addressed is rejefted herewith.&quot;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.9.3.
				<lb />
				In the operative part of the Order of demolition dated 9 th ieptember,
				<lb />
				2020, ihri Late has whilst rejecting the reply vled by the Petitioner stated that he was
				<lb />
				satisved that the Petitioner was carrying out the work as mentioned in the ichedule to
				<lb />
				the impugned Notice, and had failed to produce the permission/ approval/ sanction
				<lb />
				granted to carry out the changes in the approved B.C.C. plan dated 7 th March, 1979.
				<lb />
				Therefore, the work carried out by the Petitioner as mentioned in the ichedule to the
				<lb />
				impugned Notice was declared as unauthorized. It was also stated that he was satisved
				<lb />
				that the Petitioner had not stopped the work and therefore, the notice structure as
				<lb />
				mentioned in the ichedule of the Notice was liable to be forthwith demolished.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.9.4.
				<lb />
				When this Court, in the course of hearing, commented that though in
				<lb />
				paragraph 3 of his Order, ihri Late has stated that, &quot;it has been notifed that after
				<lb />
				refeipt of the notife you have not stopped farrying the work and fontinued the work&quot;, ihri
				<lb />
				Late has not mentioned in any of his Afdavits when it was noticed by him or any of
				<lb />
				his ofcers after the inspection had taken place on 7 th ieptember, 2020 that the work
				<lb />
				was continued after the inspection on 7 th ieptember, 2020, on the next date of hearing,
				<lb />
				a response to the above observation was thought of by the MCGM, and it was
				<lb />
				submitted that since the Petitioner in her reply to the Notice had not mentioned that
				<lb />
				she had stopped the work, it was presumed that the work had not stopped. The
				<lb />
				MCGM had to be reminded that the Advocate for the Petitioner in his reply to the
				<lb />
				impugned Notice, had categorically stated that, &quot;no work has been farried out by the
				<lb />
				Petitioner in her premises as falsely understood by you啾 and therefore啾 the stop work notife
				<lb />
				issued to the Petitioner is absolutely bad-in-law and appears to have been issued only to
				<lb />
				intimidate the Petitioner by misusing his dominant position.&quot; To this, the response was
				<lb />
				that the Advocate for the Petitioner had not written in the reply letter dated 8 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020 that no unauthorized work was being carried out in the said
				<lb />
				Bungalow.
				<lb />
				ihri Late is certainly aware that the work of applying
				<lb />
				paint/polish/waterproovng material on the wall / ceiling of a room or rooms cannot be
				<lb />
				construed as anything other than tenantable repairs under iection 342 of the Act and
				<lb />
				<lb />
				therefore the alleged ongoing unlawful work/s set out in the impugned Notice was
				<lb />
				referred to by the Advocate as the work &quot;falsely understood by you&quot;. The MCGM, after
				<lb />
				issuing the impugned Notice, without forwarding the required photographs of the
				<lb />
				unauthorized works, as well as the sketch showing the unauthorized works, or even
				<lb />
				otherwise, certainly cannot expect a response from the Petitioner or her Advocate in
				<lb />
				the language that they want their allegations to be responded to. The statement made
				<lb />
				by the Advocate for the Petitioner in his reply letter clearly conveys that no work was
				<lb />
				being carried out by the Petitioner as alleged by the MCGM. The Advocate has also
				<lb />
				recorded that the Department of ihri Late has made allegations in the impugned
				<lb />
				Notice by resorting to falsehood. The Advocate, who was running against time and
				<lb />
				working in the absence of his client in Mumbai, was certainly not expected to address a
				<lb />
				detailed reply as to how the impugned Notice was based on incorrect facts / falsehood.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.9.5.
				<lb />
				As set out hereinabove, the impugned Notice dated 7 th ieptember, 2020
				<lb />
				was issued under iection 354A of the Act despite the entire &apos;unauthorized work&apos;
				<lb />
				having been completed in all respects and only one person alongwith his helper was
				<lb />
				doing some painting / polishing / waterproovng work in the discussion room, which
				<lb />
				room again, as pointed out hereinabove, was completed atleast by April-May 2020 in
				<lb />
				all respects. Under the circumstances, ihri Late could certainly have granted some
				<lb />
				time to the Petitioner to come to Mumbai and deal with the allegations of the MCGM,
				<lb />
				which ihri Late refused to do. Admittedly, ihri Late before pasting his Order of
				<lb />
				demolition dated 9 th ieptember, 2020 on the outer wall of the said Bungalow on 9 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020 at 10.35 a.m. stating that, &quot;the notife strufture as mentioned in the
				<lb />
				sfhedule of the notife is liable for forthwith demolition at your risk啾 fosts and fonsequenfes
				<lb />
				therein&quot;, was already stationed at the said Bungalow alongwith his entire demolition
				<lb />
				squad with necessary equipment including a JCB and number of Police Ofcials, and
				<lb />
				started the demolition by 11.00 a.m.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.10.
				<lb />
				Demolition on 9 th September, 2020 :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.10.1.
				<lb />
				MCGM commenced demolition of the said Bungalow on 9 th ieptember,
				<lb />
				2020 and continued the same until this Court passed an ad-interim Order for stay of
				<lb />
				demolition. As set out hereinabove, before the above Order of demolition dated 9 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020 passed by ihri Late was served by MCGM on the Petitioner by
				<lb />
				pasting a copy of the same on the said Bungalow, ihri Late alongwith his demolition
				<lb />
				squad (40 persons according to the news report in &apos;iaamna&apos; dated 10 th ieptember,
				<lb />
				2020) was ready at the site alongwith a huge contingent of police ofcers to
				<lb />
				commence the demolition. As stated hereinabove, the Advocate for the Petitioner
				<lb />
				moved this Court with a Writ Petition, the hearing of which commenced at 12.30 p.m.
				<lb />
				on 9 th ieptember, 2020. However, MCGM left no stone unturned in attempting to
				<lb />
				delay the said hearing. The same is recorded by this Court in its Order dated 9 th
				<lb />
				ieptember, 2020, paragraphs 5 and 6 of which are relevant and reproduced
				<lb />
				hereunder :-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				5. The matter was falled out at 12.30 p.m. However啾 for the first
				<lb />
				ten minutes啾 none appeared for the MCGM despite notife being
				<lb />
				served on them by the Petitioner&apos;s Advofate. In the meantime啾 the
				<lb />
				Advofate for the Petitioner informed the Court that today
				<lb />
				morning at around 11.00 a.m.啾 the MCGM moved its entire
				<lb />
				mafhinery and in the presenfe of several polife offers啾 started
				<lb />
				farrying out the job of demolition by use of heavy mafhines and by
				<lb />
				now 40% of the said Premises is already demolished by the
				<lb />
				MCGM. Thereafter啾 an in-house Advofate of the MCGM
				<lb />
				appeared and informed the Court that they do not have a fopy of
				<lb />
				the Writ Petition. The Advofate for the Petitioner informed the
				<lb />
				Court that a fopy of the Writ Petition has been served on the
				<lb />
				MCGM. This Court inquired from the Advofate for the MCGM
				<lb />
				whether she at least had a fopy of the impugned Notife issued by
				<lb />
				the Corporation to the Petitioner. The answer given was in the
				<lb />
				negative. When this Court inquired as to who is instrufting her in
				<lb />
				the matter啾 she informed the Court that none of the Offers of the
				<lb />
				MCGM are present with her. Sinfe the Court was of the view that
				<lb />
				the MCGM is trying to waste the time of the Court and in the
				<lb />
				meantime fomplete the demolition of the said Premises啾 the
				<lb />
				Advofate for MCGM was orally instrufted by the Court to
				<lb />
				forthwith inform the Munifipal Commissioner that the Court has
				<lb />
				direfted the MCGM to forthwith stop the demolition work啾 in the
				<lb />
				light of today&apos;s hearing pending before the Court. Sinfe no flear
				<lb />
				assuranfe was foming from the Advofate that the Munifipal
				<lb />
				Commissioner was so informed啾 the Court Assofiate at our
				<lb />
				instanfe tried to fall up the Munifipal Commissioner啾 whose
				<lb />
				fellphone was fontinuously switfhed-of. Ten minutes thereafter啾
				<lb />
				the in-house Advofate for the Corporation informed the Court
				<lb />
				that the direftions of this Court were fonveyed to the Munifipal
				<lb />
				Commissioner. About 15 minutes thereafter啾 Shri Sakhare啾 Senior
				<lb />
				Advofate啾 for MCGM appeared before the Court through video-
				<lb />
				fonferenfing. In response to a query by the Court啾 he informed the
				<lb />
				Court that he too is not having a fopy of the Writ Petition as well
				<lb />
				as fopy of the impugned Notife and that the Offers of the
				<lb />
				Corporation are not with him sinfe he is appearing from his
				<lb />
				residenfe.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				6. We find the above fonduft of the MCGM highly deplorable啾
				<lb />
				more so sinfe the MCGM was well aware that a Writ Petition
				<lb />
				would be filed by the Petitioner before this Court at any time啾 and
				<lb />
				an applifation seeking urgent orders will be moved by the
				<lb />
				Petitioner啾 and MCGM had therefore filed a Caveat before this
				<lb />
				Court. We therefore啾 informed Senior Advofate Shri Sakhare that
				<lb />
				sufh fonduft on the part of the MCGM is totally unaffeptable to
				<lb />
				the Court. However啾 Shri Sakhare immediately arranged to bring
				<lb />
				the Assistant Munifipal Commissioner as well as the Exefutive
				<lb />
				Engineer (B&amp;F) of H/W Ward of MCGM online to answer the
				<lb />
				queries raised by the Court.&quot;

				From the analysis of the above facts, photographs and documents, i.e. (i)
				<lb />
				the tweets of the Petitioner, more particularly, the tweet dated 3 rd ieptember, 2020,
				<lb />
				wherein she has stated that &quot;Sanjay Raut has given me an open threat and asked me not to

				ieptember, 2020 at 12.30 p.m. thereby ensuring 40% demolition of the said Bungalow,
				<lb />
				before this Court could pass the ad-interim Order restraining the MCGM from
				<lb />
				continuing with the demolition of the said bungalow ; (xiv) the demolition of the said
				<lb />
				bungalow reported on 10 th ieptember, 2020, i.e. immediately on the day after the
				<lb />
				demolition on the vrst page of the newspaper &apos;iaamna&apos; of which ihri Raut is
				<lb />
				Executive Editor, in a manner of rejoicing and victoriously, with the headline &quot;m[kkM
				<lb />
				fn;k&quot;, meaning : &apos;uprooted&apos; and interalia stating in the said news report, that the
				<lb />
				Petitioner who was unnecessarily spoiling the name of Mumbai Police by comparing
				<lb />
				Mumbai with Pakistan Occupied Kashmir has received a good blow from MCGM,
				<lb />
				lends credence to the Petitioner&apos;s case that the action of demolition was malavde and
				<lb />
				was predetermined with a view to cause injury to the Petitioner before she could come
				<lb />
				to Mumbai on 9 th ieptember, 2020 in retaliation to her tweet stating that she has been
				<lb />
				openly threatened by ihri ianjay Raut and concluding the said tweet by questioning as
				<lb />
				to &quot;why Mumbai is feeling like Pakistan offupied Kashmir ?&quot;.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.12.
				<lb />
				There is material, both in form of pleadings and evidence adduced
				<lb />
				before the Court, indicating that the action of demolition smacks of malavdes. The
				<lb />
				attempt made on behalf of the Respondents to deny the allegations made by the
				<lb />
				Petitioner and to justify the conduct of the MCGM by making allegations against the
				<lb />
				Petitioner of making false statements, denials, withholding of material facts, lack of
				<lb />
				averments in the Petition, allegations being general and vague based on conjunctures
				<lb />
				and surmises etc. are belied by this material, much of which is set out /pointed out in
				<lb />
				detail hereinabove. We would however, refrain from rendering a vnal verdict on
				<lb />
				malice in fact on the basis of this material for two reasons. The vrst is that it is possible
				<lb />
				to say that the material may not be sufcient for a Civil Court to make a declaration of
				<lb />
				malice in fact; it may be necessary to allow the parties to lead further oral /
				<lb />
				documentary evidence and that may call for a trial. iecondly, and more importantly, it
				<lb />
				is really not necessary for us to make a declaration, though we are of the view that the
				<lb />
				material placed before us makes a strong case of such declaration, since there is a clear
				<lb />
				and palpable case of malice in law which is sufcient to redress the Petitioners
				<lb />
				grievance in this petition, as we have pointed out below.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.13.
				<lb />
				Before we do so, however, we would in particular want to deal with the
				<lb />
				submission of ihri Chinoy namely, that if iection 354A of the Act is to be restricted
				<lb />
				only to the actual erection work ongoing on the date of the inspection and the issuance
				<lb />
				of the notice, it would result in an absurd situation that where work on the property is
				<lb />
				ongoing, the portion which has been done yesterday, or a few days ago cannot be the
				<lb />
				subject matter of iection 354A of the Act and only the portion of the work which is
				<lb />
				actually ongoing on the day of inspection can be subject matter of iection 354A of the
				<lb />
				Act. There is no such submission made in the present case by the Petitioner. As set
				<lb />
				out in paragraphs 14.1 to 14.18 and the photographs produced therein and also the
				<lb />
				photographs produced by the MCGM itself, as held hereinabove, show that all the
				<lb />
				works described in Items &apos;a&apos; to &apos;n&apos; of the impugned notice dated 7 th ieptember, 2020
				<lb />
				were in existence much before the date of the inspection, i.e. atleast since April-May
				<lb />
				2020. Even the discussion room in which the job of painting / polishing /
				<lb />
				<lb />
				waterproovng was ongoing, as of the date of the inspection was complete in all
				<lb />
				respects as can be seen in the photographs at page 66 of this Order bears testimony to
				<lb />
				the fact that the said discussion room was complete in all respects atleast since April-
				<lb />
				May 2020. On the other hand, and in any event, if the submission of ihri Chinoy that
				<lb />
				if any work is ongoing in an existing huge structure, which is unauthorized, the entire
				<lb />
				structure should be demolished by issuing a 24 hours notice under iection 354A of the
				<lb />
				Act, were to be accepted, the same would lead to an absurd situation and misuse of
				<lb />
				power by the ofcials of the MCGM leading to demolition of an entire unauthorized
				<lb />
				structure, constructed, say, 20 years back, on the ground that some renovation work /
				<lb />
				vnishing work is ongoing in the interior of the structure. iection 351 of the Act would
				<lb />
				in that event become practically otiose.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.14.
				<lb />
				Assuming that the above facts and evidence is not enough to reach a
				<lb />
				conclusion of personal bias, grudge and oblique or improper motive or ulterior
				<lb />
				purpose they do unmistakably sustain a case of legal malice.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.14.1.
				<lb />
				Despite a strong case of malavdes being made out as set out
				<lb />
				hereinabove, even if one assumes that these facts and the irresistible conclusion that
				<lb />
				may follow from them do not amount to a proven case of personal bias, grudge,
				<lb />
				oblique or improper motive or ulterior purpose and in that sense, may call for a trial,
				<lb />
				they do unmistakably sustain a case of legal malice for this Court to issue its Writ. As
				<lb />
				distinguished from malice in fact, which is required to be expressly pleaded and
				<lb />
				proved, though not necessarily by direct evidence, &apos;malice in law&apos;, as held by the
				<lb />
				iupreme Court in State of A.P v. Govardhanlal Pitti (supra), means &quot;something done
				<lb />
				without lawful excuse&quot;; it is an act done wrongfully and willfully without reasonable or
				<lb />
				probable cause, and not necessarily an act done from ill feeling and spite. It is a
				<lb />
				&quot;deliberate act in disregard of the rights of others&quot;. As iupreme Court observed in
				<lb />
				that case, using the explanation of Prof. Wade in &quot;Administrative Law&quot; (8 Edn., at p.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				414), itate action can be described as malavde if it is &quot;for a purpose not authorized by
				<lb />
				the Act&quot; under which it is taken. The iupreme Court in State of Punjab v. Gurdial
				<lb />
				Singh (supra) held that where the true object is to reach an end diferent from the one
				<lb />
				for which the power is entrusted, exercise of that power by its custodian is bad in law
				<lb />
				and lacking in bonavdes.
				<lb />
				17.14.2.
				<lb />
				As we have noted above, so far as the ofending works (i.e. works
				<lb />
				in breach of iections 342 and 347) referred to in the schedule to the impugned notice
				<lb />
				under iection 354A in our case are concerned, they are clearly referred to in the
				<lb />
				impugned notice as having been completed. The impugned notice (together with its
				<lb />
				schedule) refers to an inspection carried out prior to it being issued, which shows the
				<lb />
				following works as having been carried out unauthorizedly:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				a. Toilet converted into an ofce cabin;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				b. Kitchen constructed in store room;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				c. New toilets constructed beside staircase inside store room and in parking
				<lb />
				area;
				<lb />
				d. Unauthorized pantry constructed on ground foor;
				<lb />
				e. Unauthorized room / cabin with wooden partition made in living room
				<lb />
				on the vrst foor;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				f. Unauthorized room / cabin with wooden partition made in pooja room
				<lb />
				on vrst foor;
				<lb />
				g. Unauthorized construction of toilets in open chowk area;
				<lb />
				h. Unauthorized horizontal extension of slab on front side;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				i. itaircase orientation changed on the second foor;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				j. Balcony found enclosed in habitable area by removing partition walls on
				<lb />
				second foor;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				k. Unauthorized horizontal extension of slab at front side on second foor;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				l. Bedroom of adjoining bungalow merged into the Petitioner&apos;s bungalow
				<lb />
				by removing the partition wall on second foor;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				m. Toilet of adjoining bedroom of the adjoining bungalow removed and
				<lb />
				used as habitable area on second foor, and
				<lb />
				n. Position of the main entrance gate found changed.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				Each of these works, by the MCGM&apos;s own admission, was a completed
				<lb />
				work; there is no case, and none is borne out by the material relied upon by the
				<lb />
				MCGM, that any of these works was an ongoing work. These works were found as
				<lb />
				beyond approved B.C.C. Plan dated 7 th March,1979. If these works were beyond the
				<lb />
				approved Building Completion Certivcate Plan of 7 th March,1979 and were found at
				<lb />
				the date of the inspection, i.e. on 5 th ieptember, 2020, that means they could have
				<lb />
				been carried out anytime between 7 th March,1979 and 5 th ieptember, 2020. If that is
				<lb />
				so, there is absolutely no case to proceed under iection 354A and remove them or pull
				<lb />
				them down.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.14.3.
				<lb />
				The materials relied upon by the MCGM in support of its case,
				<lb />
				including the photographs produced before the Court, do not at all indicate that any of
				<lb />
				these works were being carried out at the bungalow at the time of issuance of the
				<lb />
				impugned Notice under iection 354A of the Act. Mere presence of some workmen or
				<lb />
				some construction debris is no evidence that the works referred to in the impugned
				<lb />
				notice were ongoing works.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.14.4.
				<lb />
				The object and purpose of iection 354A is stoppage of
				<lb />
				unauthorized ongoing work (which is described in iection 342) by a notice and its
				<lb />
				removal, if despite such notice the noticee does not stop the unauthorized ongoing
				<lb />
				work or produce authorization within twenty-four hours. The purpose is not
				<lb />
				demolition of unauthorized work already carried out (in contravention of iections 342
				<lb />
				or 347). The itate action of demolition of works under iection 354A in the present
				<lb />
				case, is thus clearly for a purpose not authorized by the Act. There is no reasonable or
				<lb />
				probable cause or excuse for the itate action complained of and it has been carried
				<lb />
				out, as we shall demonstrate presently, wrongfully and willfully.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.14.5.
				<lb />
				We shall deal with the willful part vrst. As we have seen above,
				<lb />
				there is a distinction between iections 351 and 354A of the Act and the two provisions
				<lb />
				have been judicially analyzed extensively to bring out that distinction. What is more,
				<lb />
				even the MCGM itself has made it abundantly clear that the two provisions operate in
				<lb />
				diferent velds and call for diferent approaches. As set out hereinabove, the MCGM,
				<lb />
				in supersession of its earlier instructions, laid down guidelines for the guidance of its
				<lb />
				staf in its Circular dated 15 th March, 2012. These guidelines provide for procedure to
				<lb />
				be followed for action to be taken under iections 354A and 351 of the Act. At the very
				<lb />
				outset, even at the cost of repetition it must be pointed out that the guidelines
				<lb />
				distinguish between two diferent situations; Part A, which deals with action under
				<lb />
				iection 354A, contains the procedure to be followed &quot;for on-going unauthorized
				<lb />
				<lb />
				fonstruftion&quot;, whilst Part B, dealing with iection 351, is &quot;For existing unauthorized
				<lb />
				fonstruftion&quot;. Part A provides for a situation where &quot;any unauthorized fonstruftion is in
				<lb />
				progress fontrary to the provisions of Seftion 342 and 347 of the Aft and where fhange in
				<lb />
				foundation啾 plinth or struftural addition啾 alteration啾 load bearing walls endangering the life
				<lb />
				and property of the offupiers or other persons is detefted.&quot; The concerned ofcer detecting
				<lb />
				such work has then to take photographs showing the date and status of the work and
				<lb />
				prepare a Panchnama / Inspection Report &quot;of the work in progress&quot;. He then has to
				<lb />
				make an entry to that efect in detection register and then prepare a notice under
				<lb />
				iection 354A of the Act. On the other hand, for existing unauthorized construction,
				<lb />
				the MCGM staf is mandated to proceed under iection 351, requiring the owner /
				<lb />
				occupier of unauthorized construction to show within 7 days&apos; time that the work
				<lb />
				complained of is &quot;farried out in affordanfe with the provisions of Seftion 337啾 342 and
				<lb />
				Seftion 347of the MMC Aft&quot;. The Circular of 15 th March, 2012, thus, makes it very
				<lb />
				clear when and how, consistent with the purpose of iection 354A discussed above, the
				<lb />
				MCGM&apos;s staf should resort to a notice under iection 354A. A deliberate resort to
				<lb />
				iection 354A, in contravention of the law, the authority of Courts and the MCGM&apos;s
				<lb />
				own Circular, in the case of an existing unauthorized structure (that is to say, assuming
				<lb />
				that the structure is unauthorized being beyond approved B.C.C. plan of the building),
				<lb />
				can only be described as willful.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.14.6.
				<lb />
				Coming now to the wrongfulness of the itate action, it is
				<lb />
				important to note at the outset that anything which is not authorized by law and which
				<lb />
				infringes a citizen&apos;s rights is wrongful on the part of the itate. As we have seen above,
				<lb />
				assuming that the subject structures were illegal and amounted to unauthorized works
				<lb />
				as per iections 342 and 347 of the Act, it was the Petitioner&apos;s right to show cause why
				<lb />
				they should not be removed, altered or pulled down. Even after passing of a vnal
				<lb />
				Order for removal, alteration or pulling down of these works, upon her failure to show
				<lb />
				sufcient cause, it was open to the Petitioner to approach the MCGM for
				<lb />
				regularization of such works under iection 53(3) of the MRTP Act or alternatively,
				<lb />
				approach the Court for preventing the threatened action. To the extent she was
				<lb />
				prevented from doing so, the action of the MCGM in taking precipitate steps under
				<lb />
				iection 354A, as we have noted above, can only be described as wrongful. But what
				<lb />
				really aggravates the wrongfulness and lends further credence to the case of malice in
				<lb />
				law, is the manner in which the whole action was carried out as we have described
				<lb />
				above.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.14.7.
				<lb />
				The manner in which the action was carried out, as we have noted
				<lb />
				above, leaves hardly any manner of doubt that the purpose for using the provision of
				<lb />
				iection 354A in the instant case was not only unauthorized, considering the
				<lb />
				distinction between iections 351 and 354A, but more sinister than that, namely, to
				<lb />
				prevent the Petitioner from taking recourse to her legal remedies. The whole attempt
				<lb />
				on the part of the Respondent -MCGM and its ofcers was to somehow present the
				<lb />
				Petitioner with a fait accompli, leaving her practically no time to seek redressal of her
				<lb />
				grievance through Courts by means of preventive action.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.14.8.
				<lb />
				That sums up the case against the Respondents of malice in law.
				<lb />
				The MCGM, which is an organ of the itate, has done something &quot;without lawful
				<lb />
				excuse&quot;; it has proceeded to act &quot;wrongfully and willfully without reasonable or
				<lb />
				probable cause&quot;; its act can only be described as a deliberate act in disregard of the
				<lb />
				rights of a citizen; the true object of the act clearly appears to be to reach an end
				<lb />
				diferent from the one for which the power was entrusted to it. The exercise of power
				<lb />
				can be summed up as bad in law and lacking in bonavdes. It is nothing but malice in
				<lb />
				law.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				18.
				<lb />
				Maintainability of the Writ Petition :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				18.1.
				<lb />
				The MCGM at the stage of sur-rejoinder raised the contention that the
				<lb />
				Writ Petition ought not to be entertained and the Petitioner should be relegated to the
				<lb />
				remedy of a Civil iuit. It is also submitted that since several disputed questions of
				<lb />
				facts arise in the present matter, the Writ Petition should not be entertained. It was
				<lb />
				contended by MCGM that a Civil iuit is the norm and the entertaining of a Writ
				<lb />
				Petition can only be in exceptional circumstances which according to MCGM, the
				<lb />
				Petitioner has not made out. Reliance was placed by MCGM in support of this
				<lb />
				contention on the judgment of this Court in the case of Abdul Karic Ahced
				<lb />
				Mansoori v/s. Munifipal Corporation of Greater Mucbai (supra).
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				18.2.
				<lb />
				According to the Petitioner, the contention of maintainability of the Writ
				<lb />
				Petition raised at a belated stage is clearly an afterthought. It is submitted that it is
				<lb />
				apparent that on the wrongdoings of MCGM standing exposed and vnding no defence
				<lb />
				on merits, MCGM has raised this issue only in an attempt to deprive the Petitioner of
				<lb />
				her legitimate rights and remedies.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				18.3.
				<lb />
				It is also submitted on behalf of the Petitioner that there are no disputed
				<lb />
				questions of facts as alleged by the MCGM. The facts of the case are clearly
				<lb />
				established from the documents on record including the photographs produced by the
				<lb />
				MCGM itself. It is apparent from the pleadings when seen in light of the record that
				<lb />
				the MCGM has merely raised certain contentions only in an attempt to create dispute
				<lb />
				when, in fact, none exist.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				18.4.
				<lb />
				We have perused iection 515A of the Act which incorporates a bar of
				<lb />
				jurisdiction and provides that any notice issued, Order passed or direction issued by
				<lb />
				the designated ofcer, under iections 351 or 354A shall not be questioned in any iuit
				<lb />
				or legal proceedings. The constitutional validity of this provision was challenged
				<lb />
				before this Court (Coram: Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud J as he then was and i. C. Gupte J)
				<lb />
				in the case of Abdul Razzaq Sunesra v/s. MCGM (supra). A Division Bench of this
				<lb />
				Court after analyzing the scheme of the Act upheld the validity of the provision and
				<lb />
				held that a remedy of a Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is
				<lb />
				available to the Petitioner. 40 The Court held that iection 515A was intended to ensure
				<lb />
				that proceedings arising out of iections 351 and 354A do not get lost in the maze of
				<lb />
				dilatory remedies in Civil Court. 41 Thus, it is clear that in a case of proceedings arising
				<lb />
				out of iections 351 and 354A of the Act, a Writ Petition is the norm and a Civil iuit is
				<lb />
				40
				<lb />
				Paragraph 21
				<lb />
				41
				<lb />
				Paragraph 19
				<lb />
				an exception, only in certain limited circumstances. As correctly pointed out by the
				<lb />
				learned ienior Advocate for the Petitioner, the judgement relied upon by MCGM in
				<lb />
				the case of Abdul Karic Ahced Mansoori (supra) merely carved out certain very
				<lb />
				limited circumstances in which the jurisdiction of a Civil Court can still be invoked. In
				<lb />
				that case, the Petitioner had vled a iuit and his application for ad-interim relief was
				<lb />
				declined. The Petitioner vled an Appeal from Order which was also withdrawn. While
				<lb />
				the iuit was still pending, the Petitioner vled a Writ Petition challenging the same
				<lb />
				action. It was in these circumstances that the Court relegated the Petitioner in that
				<lb />
				case to a iuit and held that in certain situations, the jurisdiction of a Civil Court could
				<lb />
				still be invoked. The Court, however, categorically held in paragraph 10 that while
				<lb />
				entertaining a iuit, the Civil Court is obliged to take note of the statutory bar and to
				<lb />
				consider the maintainability of the iuit on the basis of the averments in the plaint. 42
				<lb />
				The said judgment in no manner lays down any proposition that in every situation, the
				<lb />
				Petitioner should be relegated to the remedy of a iuit.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				18.5.
				<lb />
				In any case, it is settled law as held by the iupreme Court in a catena of
				<lb />
				decisions that the availability of an alternative remedy is only a self-imposed restraint
				<lb />
				and not any bar on the jurisdiction of the High Court in exercising its jurisdiction
				<lb />
				under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The iupreme Court has held that the
				<lb />
				High Court is justived in exercising its powers to the exclusion of all other remedies
				<lb />
				when it vnds that the action of the itate or its instrumentality is arbitrary and
				<lb />
				42
				<lb />
				Paragraph 10
				<lb />
				unreasonable and as such violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. We have
				<lb />
				reached a categorical conclusion, as discussed above, that the action of the itate is
				<lb />
				arbitrary and unreasonable and informed by malice in law. io far as this conclusion is
				<lb />
				concerned, in the present case in view of the clear facts and evidence made available
				<lb />
				before this Court, no disputed question of facts can be said to have arisen. iecondly,
				<lb />
				merely because disputed questions of facts arise, a party cannot be relegated in every
				<lb />
				such case to a lengthy, dilatory and expensive process of a Civil iuit against a public
				<lb />
				body, particularly if the action is highhanded and illegal. In fact, the Courts have
				<lb />
				frowned upon public bodies raising such contentions and held that itate
				<lb />
				instrumentalities ought not to raise technical pleas to defeat the rights and legitimate
				<lb />
				claims of a citizen.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				18.6.
				<lb />
				In ABL International v/s. Export Credit (supra) the iupreme Court
				<lb />
				held as follows:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;8. As fould be seen from the arguments addressed in this appeal and as
				<lb />
				also from the divergent views of the two fourts below啾 one of the questions
				<lb />
				that falls for our fonsideration is whether a writ petition under Artifle 226
				<lb />
				of the Constitution of India is maintainable to enforfe a fontraftual
				<lb />
				obligation of the State or its instrumentality啾 by an agrieved party.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				9. In our opinion this question is no more res integra and is settled by a
				<lb />
				large number of judifial pronounfements of this Court. In K.N.
				<lb />
				Guruswamy v. State of Mysore [AIR 1954 SC 592: (1955) 1 SCR 305]
				<lb />
				this Court held: (AIR pp. 595-96啾 para 20)
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				&quot;20. The next question is whether the appellant fan fomplain of this
				<lb />
				by way of a writ. In our opinion啾 he fould have done so in an ordinary
				<lb />
				fase. The appellant is interested in these fontrafts and has a right
				<lb />
				under the laws of the State to refeive the same treatment and be given
				<lb />
				the same fhanfe as anybody else. …
				<lb />
				We would therefore in the ordinary fourse have given the appellant
				<lb />
				the writ he seeks. But啾 owing to the time whifh this matter has taken
				<lb />
				to reafh us (a fonsequenfe for whifh the appellant is in no way to
				<lb />
				blame啾 for he has done all he fould to have an early hearing)啾 there is
				<lb />
				barely a fortnight of the fontraft left to go. … A writ would therefore
				<lb />
				be inefeftive and as it is not our praftife to issue meaningless writs
				<lb />
				we must dismiss this appeal and leave the appellant fontent with an
				<lb />
				enunfiation of the law.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				10. It is flear froc the above observations of this Court in the said
				<lb />
				fase, though a writ was not issued on the fafts of that fase, this Court
				<lb />
				has held that on a given set of fafts if a State afts in an arbitrary
				<lb />
				canner even in a catter of fontraft, an aggrieved party fan
				<lb />
				approafh the fourt by way of writ under Artifle 226 of the
				<lb />
				Constitution and the fourt depending on fafts of the said fase is
				<lb />
				ecpowered to grant the relief. This judgment in K.N. Guruswamy v.
				<lb />
				State of Mysore [AIR 1954 SC 592: (1955) 1 SCR 305] was followed
				<lb />
				subsequently by this Court in the fase of D.F.O. v. Ram Sanehi Singh
				<lb />
				(1971) 3 SCC 864] wherein this Court held: (SCC p. 865啾 para 4)
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				&quot;By that order he has deprived the respondent of a valuable right. We
				<lb />
				are unable to hold that merely befause the sourfe of the right whifh
				<lb />
				the respondent flaims was initially in a fontraft啾 for obtaining relief
				<lb />
				against any arbitrary and unlawful aftion on the part of a publif
				<lb />
				authority he must resort to a suit and not to a petition by way of a
				<lb />
				writ. In view of the judgment of this Court in K.N. Guruswamy fase
				<lb />
				[AIR 1954 SC 592 : (1955) 1 SCR 305] there fan be no doubt that
				<lb />
				the petition was maintainable啾 even if the right to relief arose out of
				<lb />
				an alleged breafh of fontraft啾 where the aftion fhallenged was of a

				publif authority invested with statutory power.&quot;

				16. A perusal of this judgment though shows that a writ petition involving
				<lb />
				serious disputed questions of fafts whifh requires fonsideration of evidenfe
				<lb />
				whifh is not on reford啾 will not normally be entertained by a fourt in the
				<lb />
				exerfise of its jurisdiftion under Artifle 226 of the Constitution of India.
				<lb />
				This defision again, in our opinion, does not lay down an absolute
				<lb />
				rule that in all fases involving disputed questions of faft the parties
				<lb />
				should be relegated to a fivil suit. In this view of ours, we are
				<lb />
				supported by a judgcent of this Court in the fase of Gunwant Kaur
				<lb />
				v. Munifipal Coccittee, Bhatinda (1969) 3 SCC 769] where dealing
				<lb />
				with sufh a situation of disputed questions of faft in a writ petition this
				<lb />
				Court held: (SCC p. 774啾 paras 14-16)
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
				&quot;14. The High Court observed that they will not determine disputed
				<lb />
				question of faft in a writ petition. But what fafts were in dispute and
				<lb />
				what were admitted fould only be determined after an afdavit-in-
				<lb />
				reply was filed by the State. The High Court啾 however啾 profeeded to
				<lb />
				dismiss the petition in limine. The High Court is not deprived of
				<lb />
				its jurisdiftion to entertain a petition under Artifle 226 cerely
				<lb />
				befause in fonsidering the petitioner&apos;s right to relief questions of
				<lb />
				faft cay fall to be detercined. In a petition under Artifle 226
				<lb />
				the High Court has jurisdiftion to try issues both of faft and
				<lb />
				law. Exerfise of the jurisdiftion is, it is true, disfretionary, but
				<lb />
				the disfretion cust be exerfised on sound judifial prinfiples.
				<lb />
				When the petition raises questions of faft of a fomplex nature啾 whifh
				<lb />
				may for their determination require oral evidenfe to be taken啾 and on
				<lb />
				that affount the High Court is of the view that the dispute may not
				<lb />
				appropriately be tried in a writ petition啾 the High Court may defline
				<lb />
				to try a petition. Rejeftion of a petition in licine will norcally be
				<lb />
				justifed, where the High Court is of the view that the petition is
				<lb />
				frivolous or befause of the nature of the flaic cade dispute
				<lb />
				sought to be agitated, or that the petition against the party
				<lb />
				against whoc relief is flaiced is not caintainable or that the
				<lb />
				dispute raised thereby is sufh that it would be inappropriate to
				<lb />
				try it in the writ jurisdiftion, or for analogous reasons.
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				15. From the averments made in the petition filed by the appellants it
				<lb />
				is flear that in proof of a large number of allegations the appellants
				<lb />
				relied upon dofumentary evidenfe and the only matter in respeft of
				<lb />
				whifh fonfift of fafts may possibly arise related to the due
				<lb />
				publifation of the notififation under Seftion 4 by the Colleftor.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				16. In the present fase, in our judgcent, the High Court was not
				<lb />
				justifed in discissing the petition on the ground that it will not
				<lb />
				detercine disputed question of faft. The High Court has
				<lb />
				jurisdiftion to detercine questions of faft, even if they are in
				<lb />
				dispute and the present, in our judgcent, is a fase in whifh in
				<lb />
				the interests of both the parties the High Court should have
				<lb />
				entertained the petition and falled for an afdavitcincreply froc
				<lb />
				the respondents, and should have profeeded to try the petition
				<lb />
				instead of relegating the appellants to a separate suit&quot;

				17. The above judgment of Gunwant Kaur (1969) 3 SCC 769] finds
				<lb />
				support from another judgment of this Court in the fase of Century
				<lb />
				Spg. and Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. Ulhasnagar Munifipal Counfil [(1970) 1
				<lb />
				SCC 582] wherein this Court held: (SCC p. 587啾 para 13)
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;Merely befause a question of faft is raised啾 the High Court will not
				<lb />
				be justified in requiring the party to seek relief by the somewhat
				<lb />
				lengthy啾 dilatory and expensive profess by a fivil suit against a publif
				<lb />
				body. The questions of faft raised by the petition in this fase are
				<lb />
				elementary.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				19. Therefore, it is flear froc the above enunfiation of law that
				<lb />
				cerely befause one of the parties to the litigation raises a dispute in
				<lb />
				regard to the fafts of the fase, the fourt entertaining sufh petition
				<lb />
				under Artifle 226 of the Constitution is not always bound to relegate
				<lb />
				the parties to a suit. In the above fase of Gunwant Kaur [(1969) 3
				<lb />
				SCC 769] this Court even went to the extent of holding that in a writ
				<lb />
				petition, if the fafts require, even oral evidenfe fan be taken. This
				<lb />
				flearly shows that in an appropriate fase, the writ fourt has the
				<lb />
				jurisdiftion to entertain a writ petition involving disputed questions
				<lb />
				of faft and there is no absolute bar for entertaining a writ petition
				<lb />
				even if the same arises out of a fontraftual obligation and/or involves some
				<lb />
				disputed questions of faft.&quot;
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				27. Froc the above disfussion of ours, the following legal prinfiples
				<lb />
				ecerge as to the caintainability of a writ petition:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(a) In an appropriate fase, a writ petition as against a State or
				<lb />
				an instrucentality of a State arising out of a fontraftual
				<lb />
				obligation is caintainable.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(b) Merely befause soce disputed questions of faft arise for
				<lb />
				fonsideration, sace fannot be a ground to refuse to entertain a
				<lb />
				writ petition in all fases as a catter of rule.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				(f) A writ petition involving a fonsequential relief of conetary
				<lb />
				flaic is also caintainable.&quot;
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				28. However啾 while entertaining an objeftion as to the maintainability of a
				<lb />
				writ petition under Artifle 226 of the Constitution of India啾 the fourt
				<lb />
				should bear in mind the faft that the power to issue prerogative writs under
				<lb />
				Artifle 226 of the Constitution is plenary in nature and is not limited by
				<lb />
				any other provisions of the Constitution. The High Court having regard to
				<lb />
				the fafts of the fase啾 has a disfretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ
				<lb />
				petition. The Court has imposed upon itself fertain restriftions in the
				<lb />
				exerfise of this power. (See Whirlpool Corpn. v. Registrar of Trade
				<lb />
				Marks [(1998) 8 SCC 1]) And this plenary right of the High Court to
				<lb />
				issue a prerogative writ will not norcally be exerfised by the Court to
				<lb />
				the exflusion of other available recedies unless sufh aftion of the
				<lb />
				State or its instrucentality is arbitrary and unreasonable so as to
				<lb />
				violate the fonstitutional candate of Artifle 14 or for other valid and
				<lb />
				legiticate reasons, for whifh the Court thinks it nefessary to exerfise
				<lb />
				the said jurisdiftion.&quot;
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</item>
			<p>
				18.7.
				<lb />
				In Popatrao Patil V/s. State of Maharashtra (supra), this Court declined
				<lb />
				to entertain a writ petition on the ground that there were disputed questions of facts
				<lb />
				and relegated the Petitioner to a Civil iuit. ietting aside the said decision and
				<lb />
				requiring the High Court to consider the matter on merits, the iupreme Court held
				<lb />
				thus:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;11.) No doubt that啾 normally啾 when a petition involves disputed questions
				<lb />
				of faft and law啾 the High Court would be slow in entertaining the petition
				<lb />
				under Artifle 226 of the Constitution of India. However, it is a rule of
				<lb />
				selfcrestraint and not a hard and fast rule. In any fase啾 this Court in
				<lb />
				ABL International Ltd. v. Export Credit Guarantee Corpn. of India Ltd.1
				<lb />
				has observed thus:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;19. Therefore啾 it is flear from the above enunfiation of law that
				<lb />
				merely befause one of the parties to the litigation raises a dispute in
				<lb />
				regard to the fafts of the fase啾 the fourt entertaining sufh petition
				<lb />
				under Artifle 226 of the Constitution is not always bound to relegate
				<lb />
				the parties to a suit. In the above fase of Gunwant Kaur [(1969) 3

				<lb />

			<p>
				12.)While summing up the fonflusions in the aforesaid fase啾 this Court
				<lb />
				fonfluded thus:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;27. From the above disfussion of ours啾 the following legal prinfiples
				<lb />
				emerge as to the maintainability of a writ petition:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(a) In an appropriate fase啾 a writ petition as against a State or an
				<lb />
				instrumentality of a State arising out of a fontraftual obligation is
				<lb />
				maintainable.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				(b) Merely befause some disputed questions of faft arise for
				<lb />
				fonsideration啾 same fannot be a ground to refuse to entertain a writ
				<lb />
				petition in all fases as a matter of rule. (f) A writ petition involving a
				<lb />
				fonsequential relief of monetary flaim is also maintainable.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				28. However啾 while entertaining an objeftion as to the
				<lb />
				maintainability of a writ petition under Artifle 226 of the
				<lb />
				Constitution of India啾 the fourt should bear in mind the faft that the
				<lb />
				power to issue prerogative writs under Artifle 226 of the Constitution
				<lb />
				is plenary in nature and is not limited by any other provisions of the
				<lb />
				Constitution. The High Court having regard to the fafts of the fase啾
				<lb />
				has a disfretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ petition. The
				<lb />
				Court has imposed upon itself fertain restriftions in the exerfise of
				<lb />
				this power. (See Whirlpool Corpn.v.Registrar of Trade Marks
				<lb />
				[(1998) 8 SCC 1].) And this plenary right of the High Court to issue
				<lb />
				a prerogative writ will not normally be exerfised by the Court to the
				<lb />
				exflusion of other available remedies unless sufh aftion of the State
				<lb />
				or its instrumentality is arbitrary and unreasonable so as to violate
				<lb />
				the fonstitutional mandate of Artifle 14 or for other valid and
				<lb />
				legitimate reasons啾 for whifh the Court thinks it nefessary to exerfise
				<lb />
				the said jurisdiftion.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				13.)It fould thus be seen, that even if there are disputed questions of
				<lb />
				faft whifh fall for fonsideration but if they do not require elaborate
				<lb />
				evidenfe to be addufed, the High Court is not prefluded froc
				<lb />
				entertaining a petition under Artifle 226 of the Constitution.
				<lb />
				However, sufh a plenary power has to be exerfised by the High Court
				<lb />
				in exfeptional firfucstanfes. The High Court would be justifed in
				<lb />
				exerfising sufh a power to the exflusion of other available recedies
				<lb />
				only when it fnds that the aftion of the State or its instrucentality is
				<lb />
				arbitrary and unreasonable and, as sufh, violative of Artifle 14 of
				<lb />
				the Constitution of India. In any fase啾 in the present fase啾 we find that

				there are hardly any disputed questions of fafts.

				inevitably gets involved in disputes with private individuals. But it
				<lb />
				must be remembered that the State is no ordinary party trying to win

				a fase against one of its own fitizens by hook or by frook; for the

				State&apos;s interest is to meet honest flaims啾 vindifate a substantial de-

				<lb />
				to avoid a just liability or sefure an unfair advantage啾 simply befause

				legal devifes provide sufh an opportunity. The State is a virtuous
				<lb />
				litigant and looks with unfonfern on immoral forensif suffesses so
				<lb />
				that if on the merits the fase is weak啾 Government shows a

				<lb />
				In Century Spinning and Manufafturing Cocpany v/s. Ulhas Nagar
				<lb />
				Munifipal Counfil (supra) the iupreme Court held that merely because a question of
				<lb />
				fact is raised the High Court should not require the party to seek reliefs by the
				<lb />
				somewhat dilatory, lengthy and expensive process of a Civil iuit against public body
				<lb />
				particularly when questions of facts are elementary. The Court is not incompetent to
				<lb />
				decide an issue of fact which can be determined from the material on record. It held as
				<lb />
				follows:
				<lb />
				&quot;8.)The High Court may啾 in exerfise of its disfretion啾 defline to exerfise its
				<lb />
				extraordinary jurisdiftion under Artifle 226 of the Constitution. But the
				<lb />
				disfretion is judifial if the petition makes a flaim whifh is frivolous啾
				<lb />
				vexatious啾 or prima fafie unjust啾 or may not appropriately be tried in a
				<lb />
				petition invoking extraordinary jurisdiftion啾 the Court may defline to
				<lb />
				entertain the petition. But a party flaicing to be aggrieved by the
				<lb />
				aftion of a publif body or authority on the plea that the aftion is
				<lb />
				unlawful, highchanded, arbitrary or unjust is entitled to a hearing of
				<lb />
				its petition on the cerits. Apparently the petition filed by the Company
				<lb />
				did not raise any fomplifated questions of faft for determination啾 and the
				<lb />
				flaim fould not be fharafterised as frivolous啾 vexatious or unjust. The
				<lb />
				High Court has given no reasons for discissing the petition in licine,
				<lb />
				and on a fonsideration of the avercents in the petition and the
				<lb />
				caterials plafed before the Court we are satisfed that the Cocpany
				<lb />
				was entitled to have its grievanfe against the aftion of the
				<lb />
				Munifipality, whifh was prica fafie unjust, tried.&quot;

				13.)Mr Gokhale appearing on behalf of the Munifipality urged that the
				<lb />
				petition filed by the Company apparently raised questions of faft whifh in
				<lb />
				the view of the High Court fould not appropriately be tried in the exerfise of
				<lb />
				the extraordinary jurisdiftion under Artifle 226. But the High Court has
				<lb />
				not said so啾 and on a review of the averments made in the petition this
				<lb />
				argument fannot be sustained. Merely befause a question of faft is
				<lb />
				raised, the High Court will not be justifed in requiring the party to
				<lb />
				seek relief by the socewhat lengthy, dilatory and expensive profess by
				<lb />
				a fivil suit against a publif body. The questions of faft raised by the
				<lb />
				petition in this fase are elecentary.&quot;

				18.9
				<lb />
				In Sayed Maqbool Ali V/s. State of U.P. (supra) the iupreme Court held
				<lb />
				thus:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				&quot;9.) The remedy of a landholder whose land is taken without afquisition is
				<lb />
				either to file a fivil suit for refovery of possession and/or for fompensation啾
				<lb />
				or approafh the High Court by filing a writ petition if the aftion fan be
				<lb />
				shown to be arbitrary啾 irrational啾 unreasonable啾 biased啾 mala fide or
				<lb />
				without the authority of law啾 and seek a direftion that the land should be
				<lb />
				afquired in a manner known to law. The appellant has fhosen to follow the
				<lb />
				sefond fourse. The High Court was not啾 therefore啾 justified in dismissing
				<lb />
				the writ petition on the ground that the remedy was under Seftion 18 of the
				<lb />
				Aft. The order of the High Court啾 whifh is virtually a non-speaking order啾
				<lb />
				apparently profeeded on the basis that the appellant was seeking infrease in
				<lb />
				fompensation for an afquired land. The matter therefore啾 requires to be
				<lb />
				refonsidered by the High Court啾 on merits.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				10.) But that does not mean that the delay should be ignored or the
				<lb />
				appellant should be given relief. In sufh matters啾 the person agrieved
				<lb />
				should approafh the High Court diligently. If the writ petition is belated啾
				<lb />
				unless there is good and satisfaftory explanation for the delay啾 the petition
				<lb />
				will be rejefted on the ground of delay and lafhes. Further the High Court
				<lb />
				should be satisfied that the fase warrants the exerfise of the extraordinary
				<lb />
				jurisdiftion under Artifle 226 of the Constitution of India啾 and that the
				<lb />
				matter is one where the alternative remedy of suit is not appropriate. For
				<lb />
				example啾 if the person agrieved and the State are owners of adjoining
				<lb />
				lands and the flaims that the State has enfroafhed over a part of his land啾
				<lb />
				or if there is a simple boundary dispute啾 the remedy will lie only in a fivil
				<lb />
				suit啾 as the dispute does not relate to any high-handed啾 arbitrary or
				<lb />
				unreasonable aftion of the offers of the State and there is a need to
				<lb />
				examine disputed questions relating to title啾 extent and aftual possession.
				<lb />
				But where the person agrieved establishes that the State had high-
				<lb />
				handedly taken over his land without refourse to afquisition or deprived
				<lb />
				him of his property without authority of law啾 the landholder may seek his
				<lb />
				remedy in a writ petition.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				11.) When a writ petitioner cakes out a fase for invoking the
				<lb />
				extraordinary jurisdiftion under Artifle 226 of the Constitution, the
				<lb />
				High Court would not relegate hic to the alternative recedy of a fivil
				<lb />
				fourt, cerely befause the catter cay involve an infidental
				<lb />
				exacination of disputed questions of fafts. The question that will
				<lb />
				ulticately weigh with the High Court is this: whether the person is
				<lb />
				seeking recedy in a catter whifh is pricarily a fivil dispute to be
				<lb />
				defided by a fivil fourt, or whether the catter relates to a dispute
				<lb />
				having a publif law elecent or violation of any fundacental right or
				<lb />
				to any arbitrary and highchanded aftion. (See the defisions of this
				<lb />
				Court in ABL International Ltd. v. Export Credit Guarantee Corpn. of
				<lb />
				India Ltd. [(2004) 3 SCC 553] and Kisan Sahkari Chini Mills Ltd. v.

				<lb />
				We are of the view, that this well settled law, when applied to the facts of
				<lb />
				the present case, makes it apparent that the objection as to the maintainability of the
				<lb />
				Writ Petition is clearly an afterthought, in order to defeat the Petitioner&apos;s rights. The
				<lb />
				Petitioner is aggrieved by an ex-facie illegal, arbitrary, unjustived and highhanded and
				<lb />
				malavde action of MCGM ignoring statutory provisions and guidelines of the Courts
				<lb />
				as well as of its own Circulars and the said action is an abuse of power and authority.
				<lb />
				The Petitioner therefore is fully justived in approaching this Court for redressal of her
				<lb />
				grievances and the protection of her rights.

				<lb />
				Reliefs sought :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				19.1.
				<lb />
				It is submitted on behalf of the Petitioner that the impugned notice,
				<lb />
				Order and the action of demolition being ex-facie illegal the same ought to be set aside;
				<lb />
				the Petitioner ought to be permitted to take such steps as are required to make the
				<lb />
				premises habitable so that the Petitioner can immediately start occupying and using
				<lb />
				the said premises. As regards the restoration of the demolition work, it is submitted
				<lb />
				that the Petitioner be allowed to take such steps as this Court may deem vt and proper
				<lb />
				in accordance with law, under the supervision of the Court. It is also submitted that
				<lb />
				the Petitioner is also entitled to compensation to make good the loss and damage
				<lb />
				caused to the Petitioner as a result of the illegal and highhanded action of MCGM.
				<lb />
				This aspect is dealt with hereunder.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				19.2.
				<lb />
				As regards the reliefs pertaining to payment of compensation by the
				<lb />
				MCGM to the Petitioner in the case of MCGM v/s. Sunbeac Hightefh Developers,
				<lb />
				(supra), the iupreme Court held that where demolition work is done illegally, even if
				<lb />
				the structure was unauthorized, compensation can be awarded by the Court. The
				<lb />
				Court observed as under:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;18.) We make it flear that we do not approve the aftion of the Munifipal
				<lb />
				Corporation or its offials in demolishing the struftures without following the
				<lb />
				profedure presfribed by law啾 but the relief whifh has to be given must be in
				<lb />
				affordanfe with law and not violative of the law. If a strufture is an illegal
				<lb />
				strufture, even though it has been decolished illegally, sufh a strufture
				<lb />
				should not be percitted to foce up again. If the Munifipal Corporation
				<lb />
				violates the profedure while decolishing the building but the strufture is
				<lb />
				totally illegal, soce focpensation fan be awarded and, in all fases where
				<lb />
				sufh focpensation is awarded the sace should invariably be refovered
				<lb />
				froc the offers who have afted in violation of law. However啾 we again
				<lb />
				reiterate that the illegal strufture fannot be permitted to be re-erefted.&quot;
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				19.3.
				<lb />
				In United Air Travel Servifes V/s. Union of India 43 the iupreme Court
				<lb />
				held thus:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;14.) The prinfiples of damages in publif law have to啾 however啾
				<lb />
				satisfy fertain tests. In Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa [Nilabati
				<lb />
				Behera v. State of Orissa啾 (1993) 2 SCC 746: 1993 SCC (Cri) 527]啾
				<lb />
				it was observed that publif law profeedings serve a diferent purpose
				<lb />
				than private law profeedings. In that fontext啾 it was observed as
				<lb />
				under: (SCC pp. 768-79啾 para 34)
				<lb />
				&quot;34. The purpose of publif law is not only to fivilise publif power but
				<lb />
				also to assure the fitizen that they live under a legal system whifh
				<lb />
				aims to proteft their interests and preserve their rights. Therefore啾
				<lb />
				when the fourt moulds the relief by granting &quot;fompensation&quot; in
				<lb />
				profeedings under Artifle 32 or 226 of the Constitution seeking
				<lb />
				enforfement or proteftion of fundamental rights啾 it does so under the
				<lb />
				publif law by way of penalising the wrongdoer and fixing the liability
				<lb />
				for the publif wrong on the State whifh has failed in its publif duty to
				<lb />
				proteft the fundamental rights of the fitizen. The paycent of
				<lb />
				focpensation in sufh fases is not to be understood, as it is
				<lb />
				generally understood in a fivil aftion for dacages under the
				<lb />
				private law but in the broader sense of providing relief by an
				<lb />
				order of caking &quot;conetary acends&quot; under the publif law for
				<lb />
				the wrong done due to breafh of publif duty, of not protefting the
				<lb />
				fundacental rights of the fitizen. The focpensation is in the
				<lb />
				nature of &quot;execplary dacages&quot; awarded against the wrongdoer
				<lb />
				for the breafh of its publif law duty and is independent of the
				<lb />
				rights available to the aggrieved party to flaic focpensation
				<lb />
				under the private law in an aftion based on tort, through a suit
				<lb />
				instituted in a fourt of focpetent jurisdiftion or/and prosefute
				<lb />
				the ofender under the penal law.&quot;
				<lb />
				(emphasis supplied)
				<lb />
				It was also emphasised that it is a sound polify to punish the
				<lb />
				wrongdoer and it is in that spirit that the fourts have moulded the
				<lb />
				relief by granting fompensation in exerfise of writ jurisdiftion. The
				<lb />
				objeftive is to ensure that publif bodies or offials do not aft
				<lb />
				unlawfully. Sinfe the issue is one of enforfement of publif duties啾 the
				<lb />
				remedy would be available under publif law notwithstanding that
				<lb />
				damages are flaimed in those profeedings.&quot;
				<lb />
				&quot;15.) The aforesaid aspeft was啾 onfe again啾 emphasised in Common
				<lb />
				Cause v. Union of India [Common Cause v. Union of India啾 (1999)
				<lb />
				6 SCC 667 : 1999 SCC (Cri) 1196] . We may also usefully refer to N.
				<lb />
				Nagendra Rao &amp; Co. v. State of A.P. [N. Nagendra Rao &amp;
				<lb />
				Co. v. State of A.P.啾 (1994) 6 SCC 205 : 1994 SCC (Cri) 1609] qua
				<lb />
				the proposition that the determination of vifarious liability of the
				<lb />
				State being linked with the negligenfe of its offer is nothing new if
				<lb />
				they fan be sued personally for whifh there is no dearth of authority.&quot;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				16.) In the fafts of the present fase啾 the arbitrariness and illegality of
				<lb />
				the aftion of the authority is writ large. The petitioners have been
				<lb />
				deprived of their right to sefure the quota on a patently wrongful order
				<lb />
				passed for reasons啾 whifh did not apply to them and for fonditions啾
				<lb />
				whifh had been spefififally exempted. What fould be a greater
				<lb />
				arbitrariness and illegality? Where there is sufh patent arbitrariness
				<lb />
				and illegality啾 there is fonsequent violation of the prinfiples enshrined
				<lb />
				under Artifle 14 of the Constitution of India. The fafts of the present
				<lb />
				fase are啾 thus啾 undoubtedly giving rise to the satisfaftion of
				<lb />
				parameters as a fit fase for grant of fompensation.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				17.) On a fonspeftus of the aforesaid fafts influding the number of
				<lb />
				pilgrims for whom the petitioners would have been entitled to arrange
				<lb />
				the Haj pilgrimage啾 an amount of Rs 5 lakhs per petitioner would be
				<lb />
				adequate fompensation for the loss sufered by them and subserve the
				<lb />
				ends of justife. We are fonsfious of the faft that there is no
				<lb />
				quantififation based on aftual loss啾 but then the award by us is in the
				<lb />
				nature of damages in publif law.&quot;
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				19.4.
				<lb />
				As we have come to a clear conclusion that the impugned notice
				<lb />
				under iection 354A of the Act and the action of demolition following it, are
				<lb />
				actuated by malavdes, in any event, involve a clear malice in law, causing a
				<lb />
				substantial injury to the Petitioner, we would be perfectly justived, on the basis
				<lb />
				of the law stated by the iupreme Court in the case of Sunbeac Hightefh
				<lb />
				Developers (supra), to order compensation against responsible Respondents. Any
				<lb />
				such Order must be preceded by an estimate prepared by an approved valuer of
				<lb />
				the damage caused to the Petitioner&apos;s property. We would therefore have a
				<lb />
				valuer appointed for the purpose of preparing such estimate. Both parties, i.e.
				<lb />
				the Petitioner and the MCGM, shall be heard by the valuer whilst making his
				<lb />
				report of valuation. We would reserve our further Orders on such report being
				<lb />
				submitted by the valuer. We would also pass appropriate Orders on recovery of
				<lb />
				any part of such compensation from individual ofcers of the MCGM when
				<lb />
				ordering for payment of such compensation.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<item>
				19.5.
				<lb />
				As regards allowing the Petitioner to reconstruct demolished
				<lb />
				portions of the property, we record that though parties have taken contrary
				<lb />
				positions about the authorized or unauthorized ofending portions, we have not
				<lb />
				been shown any material to justify either of the contentions. We have,
				<lb />
				accordingly no occasion to decide one way or the other. We must accordingly
				<lb />
				leave the parties to their positions in law. If, and to the extent the demolished
				<lb />
				portions were originally created / constructed in accordance with law, that is to
				<lb />
				say, either as tenantable repairs for which no permission of MCGM was
				<lb />
				required, or simply matters of interior decoration and work for which no
				<lb />
				planning permission is required, or were authorized having regard to the
				<lb />
				approved plans, the Petitioner shall be within her rights to reconstruct the same.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				In case they require a planning permission and none exists, the Petitioner may
				<lb />
				apply for such permissions and the MCGM shall be bound to deal with such
				<lb />
				application in accordance with law.

				<lb />
				reconstruction of such portion can only be made either in compliance with the

				<lb />
				In the event any application is made, the MCGM shall decide the same within a
